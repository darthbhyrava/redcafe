yo.

2~~~
Fro!

3~~~
He'll either play less or mo.

4~~~
Or the sameo

5~~~
The fans wanted him to go
But LVG said no

6~~~
I guess it just goes to show
That LVG knows moe.

7~~~
After last season, I wonder how he'll grow...

8~~~
A visually beautiful & magnificent....mo?

9~~~
With the Schneidermidfield brought in for dough 
LVG must now be the know
that from the first eleven we must let him go
Or when we hear he's benching them for the big Fro
We'll need to cut our ears off like van Gogh

10~~~
that's the worst thing ever written.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13~~~
How many games is he banned for? 3?

14~~~
I missed the game as I was sleeping (had work and not going to get up in the middle of the night for a friendly), did he feature?

15~~~
No. Commentator seemed to suggest that there as been a problem between him and Van Gaal.

16~~~
Which would be stupid to imply. Van Gaal has already said e won't be using Felllaini on tour because he'll miss the first few games of the season and he needs to focus on the player he'll be using in those games.

17~~~
Yeah, although it would seem odd if Fellaini doesnt feature at all on the tour - effectively missing preseason - when Van Gaal is so big on players getting their "match rhythm"

18~~~
But Fellaini is eligible for the CL qualification matches, so that's a bit strange.

19~~~
We've almost got too many players out on tour, De Gea, Goss and Fellaini are yet to feature and we've used 24 players already

I think Fellaini will get some preseason game time, but only from the bench. I'm expecting Van Gaal to use him in this capacity next season anyway so he doesn't need full match fitness really. Can't help but feel he'll be sold if anyone shows any interest in him.

20~~~
Ah. Good point. His complete omission so far is a little strange then.

21~~~
Perhaps, pass and move not being his strong point, he's going to be shown the door?

We're certainly packed in CM:

Schmidfield
Carrick
Herrera
Blind

And AM:

Mata
Di Maria
Januzaj
Pereira
Rooney

22~~~
The thing is, he offers something a bit different to all of them. As a squad player I think he would be really useful to hold onto. Not many players in the league can have such a big impact coming off the bench. Depends on whether or not his salary/expectations make that an option though.

23~~~
Have to wonder what system van Gaal will deploy this season, as it could have huge ramifications on Fellaini's game time. If we play the 4-2-3-1/4-4-1-1 like we have in pre-season so far, he'll leave feature as part of the midfield duo and his limitations as a #10 are exacerbated in that system also. I didn't watch the game yesterday, but it sounds like Pereira made that position his own and it wouldn't surprised me if he moved ahead of Fellaini in the pecking order.

If it's the most advanced midfielder as part of a three I think Fellaini's chances improve though. He's done himself no favours with that red card against Hull though. Missing the first three PL games, and most likely the Champions League qualifiers due his lack of match rhythm. I think he'll really have to hide his time to get an extended run in the side or even pick up his first start of the season, injuries permitting.

24~~~
Right decision not to play him, he isn't part of the starting eleven and is banned for the first three games so game time should go to other players. He will still get games next season but that stupid tackle at hull could mean him missing a lot of games if other players start well.

25~~~
Van Gaal does make some strange decisions, at times. Yes, he may not be able to play the first three league games, but like others have mentioned, we will have CL games in between that, where Fellaini could possibly be used. I personally hope its all to do with that reason and nothing else, because he offers something completely different to any of our current players.

26~~~
Slightly odd if he gets no minutes whatsoever. He will still be here next season and has a role to play.

27~~~
He will probably come off the bench in one of the next few matches. I expect him to play for the U/21s to get his fitness base built up when the season starts though. That red card could really cost him, a good pre-season probbaly would have kept him his spot in the XI.

28~~~
My man big Fellaini! New he'd come good since the day we signed him. Think this season will be even better for him. The pressure is of him and he can just do what he does best: come on when we need some physical play.

29~~~
Hope you posted this from your phone. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

30~~~
Ye a bit pissed that he got that red card now. Apart from that, he had a really good end to the season, and it would have  been hard for Van Gaal not to include in the first XI. 

Still a strange decision not to play him at all so far, though, especially with him being available for CL games. Can really see him bossing it in the CL.

31~~~
Considering this is his first bit of pre season action, I thought he did well when he come on today. Looked calm on the ball, kept the ball and got stuck in.

32~~~
Yep. Great to have an option like him as a squad player as he's quite versatile in terms of playing in attacking positions. People on here are very quick to just jump to selling players if they aren't starting players, but there is a spot for someone like fellaini as a squad player. It's a long season so he'll get his chances.

33~~~
He was pretty solid for his first match. Definitely can contribute this season as hard as that is for people to accept.

34~~~
Feel like we're gonna end up hoof ball to him all day long in the 2nd half of the season. Again.

35~~~
Not really true though, is it?

36~~~
Based on what?

37~~~
Exactly what will happen. And much before the second half the season. I can see it happening in the second half of a lot of games in the first half too.

38~~~
This hoofball thing with Fellaini is this weird urban myth. I dont know if you lot actually watch whats going on when he is playing.  Most of the passes he makes and he receives are on the deck. Sure he is able to compete for aerial balls from the keeper etc but maybe people have the impression he is used for hoofball because he competes so often for those balls. Next game he plays my suggestion to all of you who think he is used to enable hoofball is to sit down with a pen and paper and make a note of how often he receives aerial balls and how often he receives to his feet. You all might get a rude surprise.  Honestly I don wonder if people actually watch games properly and I also think there is a fair bit of confirmation bias kicking in.

39~~~
You need to re-watch the end of games last season where we were doing exactly that before calling me as someone who is 'following urban myths' or confirming to biases.

It was very much a reality last season. May be its you who needs to watch games carefully.

40~~~
Sorry but we will have to agree to disagree. I was watching and counting passes with Fellaini last season when all this hoofball thing was the  favourite  myth repeated on here. Its why I made the comment here.  I think you are completely wrong, next game he plays do the numbers.

41~~~
You too. 

I am not saying that it was all we did when Fellaini started games, or that he didn't act as viable and useful outlet for De Gea whenever we couldn't move the ball out passing from the defense. However, it was our only plan when we went behind or were chasing a win in the last 15-20 minutes. It's was a regular 'Find Fellaini' contest that the rest of the team indulged in those situations.

42~~~
Bollocks, you only think that because its what you were looking for. If you truely believe that then to me you clearly werent watching very closely. Again, I repeat, try making some notes next time, count the passes and then see whats really going on.  I did and it was quite different to what you and others were claiming what was happening.
Remember that infamous game where OPTA stats were being quoted to damn RVP, something to the effect of only 7 touches all game?.  I believed it at the time because it was the impression I had. Myself and a few others checked the replay of the game and those OPTA stats were complete bollocks, he made a decent number more touches than they were reporting. Once more, next time trying actually doing the numbers.

43~~~
Either you haven't seen actual hoof ball tactics or you don't know how Fellaini plays.

Not even Everton played the hoof ball tactic as much as people here believe. It's all a myth. Being dominant in the air does not mean your team is playing hoof ball

44~~~
Normally, I'd beg anyone to buy him but...

LVG thinks Rooney can score 30 goals?!?!?! Worse yet, so does Rooney! 

Bung him up top behind Rooney. It's the only way he'll get 30 goals

45~~~
Not bollocks. I don't "look for" anything, I watch the games for entertainment and am fully cognizant of the what I am watching.

If anything, maybe you and me both need to watch the games again, and then let's reconvene on a later date, otherwise it's just calling each others posts 'Bollocks'. Or we can wait till next season when Fellaini has played a few games. Your choice.

About the second paragraph, I don't really know or care. I have never even been to any stats sites as they don't interest me. I am not here to prove anyone wrong in order to make myself look better. I am interested in football discussions, I look at posts and reply, not posters.

46~~~
Hes a very limited player but I think his goals saved LVG job, as it was looking likely we were going to finish outside top 4 once again, as our play has absolutely no attacking threat whatsoever

As our strikers where absolutely dismal we got a good few goals from fellaini and herrera to win us games

47~~~
Even he will be ahead of Herrera. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

48~~~
This is more or less what I spent most of last season saying. At this point I have pretty much given up, people will believe what they want to believe. I agree with your assessment though, that it feels like people just see "Fellaini" on the team sheet and assume that we just played 90 yard passes all game without actually watching.

What I do think is that WHEN our defenders needed to play it long, Fellaini provided a great outball for them. If he wasn't on the pitch it would be classed as a clearance, but the same thing with Fellaini and it becomes hoofball apparently.

49~~~
It isn't bollocks. There is no need to be this rabid. There has been a times (not every game) where we have used punting it up to Fellaini as a legitimate tactic in the last 15 minutes of games. That can't really be denied, we all saw it last season. I understand it wasn't to the extent that the post described, but to mention it as though it has never happened I think is incorrect.

Regarding Fellaini himself, I think he became almost a <i>security blanket</i> type player for Van Gaal. Someone who he knew he fit Van Gaal's sterile role such that keeping the ball and clogging the lanes and generally not losing it was a staple that Van Gaal clung to. Plus Fellaini was good at arriving in the box in various situations. I can't really see him letting go of that security blanket role unless it is to someone like Schwiensteiger or Schniederlin. A player who is disciplined enough and strong enough on the ball to retain it and move it along at high rate. Herrera I feel does not (in LVG's eyes) have the discipline or the physical ability (to bail him out) to make that a trusted role. Which is why we aren't seeing him and why he went with Fellaini a lot last season.

I have to admit, the way he handled Fellaini and Marouanne himself coming to the party and upping his game was really a revealing light that Fellaini is actually a much better footballer than people give him credit for. Without buying into the hyperbole I am pretty proud of him for that. Especially after such a torrid first season.

50~~~
My crystal ball.

51~~~
I don't let it bother me, that's how he rolls. There is a full gang of these irascible characters, the whole purpose of their posts is to stifle opinions with idiotic tripe like that.

52~~~
His Stats get boosted as when we are in bother we hit the high diagonal to him. That's a great option to have but if our players were not dwelling on the ball and working an actual opening this pass wouldn't be needed. Can't blame Fellsini for this! Plus DDG uses him as the target in kick outs. The big guy is actually very economic with the ball at his feet passes forward and rarely concedes possession. Set pieces he's a real threat also for and against. I'm delighted he's part of the squad and if he is in the team it doesn't bother me as he's a very good player regardless how unfashionable he is. He has much more than people are willing to give him credit for!!

53~~~
It seems like Fellaini and Herrera aren't a big part of LVG's plans for this season.

54~~~
Why Fellaini?..

55~~~
Agree. I predict we are going to see more of him this season because he's different amongst so many players that are similar. Also it's clear we are short up front and he's going to be an option

56~~~
Have I missed something here? In the second hald of the season last year we all saw that Herrera had become one of our most important players and even LVG realised that. Why is it that all of a sudden people think Herrera isn't in LVG's plans? Did he say something?

57~~~
I don't see people's issue with occasionally hoofing it to Fellaini anyway, although I believe he showed a lot more to his game last season. 

I'm sure LvG will be aiming for a more attractive style of play but if our starting eleven let us down then there's no crime in utilising the tactical options Fellaini provides. It's up to our flair players to prove themselves more effective.

58~~~
Jesus H Christ, someone disagrees with you and its a gang   doing it to stifle opinion???

59~~~
Based on what?

60~~~
Love his new profile image - dont know if it is actually new but first time I noticed it!

61~~~
Thing we really missed him when:

1) The defense was pressed and an outlet for the goalkeeper
2) On crosses and balls into the box

I reckon we would really had more chances with a target man or even a more physical player in the final third.

62~~~
It was over for Fellaini the moment we signed Bastian and Schneiderlin

63~~~
I did think we missed him at times as he is a good outlet to have and Spurs were pressing high.

64~~~
How? Fellaini's not going to be competing with those two. Actually, I honestly think had he been available today, he would have come on for Depay instead of Herrera. He would have been a great outlet for us, especially with Spurs putting pressure late on in the game.

65~~~
Also his thread picture <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

66~~~
Felt we missed the big man today.

67~~~
I think a few fans are going to be surprised/disappointed when Fellaini starts getting gametime again, once his suspension is over.

68~~~
He would have been a better sub than Herrera for Depay (yes I am aware I will have threats on my life for this comment).

69~~~
But we would have lost the game in that case <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

70~~~
Perfectly reasonable comment given how we set up. If we're going to have our centre midfielders sit so far back from our #10 they will need a target to aim at. Unless we are going to go 4-3-3 and play with our midfielders closer together, Fellaini is a better option in Van Gaal's current system than Herrera, Mata or Memphis.

71~~~
Where is he ?

72~~~
Suspended

73~~~
The same Fellaini who had the balls to put in a transfer request at Everton because that how badly he wanted to come here. The same guy who was written off after an unconvincing first season where he also bore the brunt of frustration people had for his soon to be departed manager. Yeah, he sounds like a guy to write off.

74~~~
You have to wonder where he will play when he is available again, there are just so many players in the midfield/number 10 position that he might struggle to get on the bench let alone play, that is unless LvG fancies converting him in a striker...

75~~~
Don't see any reason as to why he couldn't play the #10 role?

76~~~
Not saying he couldn't, but assuming Pedro joins we will have Mata, Herrera, and likely Depay all probably worthy of starting there before him. 

Going to be tough for him this season imo.

77~~~
He's a unique kind of player. I am sure LvG, being as much of a manager who focuses on opponents weakness and strengths  as well as a tactician, would see some uses for him. He can contribute a lot, for example, in games like away to Spurs where they are going to press really hard and we need an outlet for quicker forward transition.

78~~~
I think he would be ahead of Mata and Herrera in that position. Pedro will play wide so they won't be competing. Depay will be the interesting one.

79~~~
If he's ahead of Mata in the number 10 role then I would worry for us, Mata could well be the best number 10 in the league if given the chance.

80~~~
But he's considered a winger, which was even proven yesterday when Januzaj could've as well played on the wing, so it's irrelevant what he could be as our manager doesn't see him as a #10, shame or not. It's not like Mata's failing to deliver from the wing.

And as dustfingers said, he's pretty much an unique player, different from the ones mentioned above and I see him getting plenty of games this season.

81~~~
Mata isn't a winger, he was played there through sheer lack of options last season, and because he is so talented he did well there, long term he is too slow for that position hence the Pedro bid, and there is no way Mata is going to be Pedro's understudy.

For me Fellaini is a good option off the bemch at times, that's it.

82~~~
I'd like to see him given a chance as the lone front man, especially if his main job is to occupy two defenders and play a link up game. He's so strong and he wins everything aerially, I think he could be a decent option for the role, especially if Rooney doesn't improve.

83~~~
He is available for the UCL qualifier, right?

84~~~
He sure is.

85~~~
The same sort of thinking led Liverpool to pay 35 million for Andy Carroll.

86~~~
Fella's much more mobile than Carroll though, and better with his feet. His job is to create the space for the midfielders by dragging the centre backs around, a job he'd probably thrive at. I'm not saying it's the answer but if Rooney's form doesn't improve then I'd like to see Fellaini given a go. I don't see any other position for him in this system.

87~~~
It's no coincidence that our possession further up the pitch has suffered with the big fella being out of the side.
Coupled with Rooney having the first touch of Mike Tyson I can see why LVG would want him back in the team

88~~~
If Rooney's form doesn't improve we're in very serious trouble. In this system the number nine has to be a good goalscorer, has to be a very good striker. No other top team plays a player there whose main job is to create space for others. They're all expected to score regularly, even Benzema and Suárez, though they have Ronaldo and Messi to rely on.

If there's no position for him in this system, then he shouldn't play. But he shouldn't be shoehorned into the team just because he's different.

89~~~
Then he should be sold, no point keeping a player that you cannot play in the system that we want to play.

90~~~
This is roughly how I see it as well. In the current system we have the likes of Januzaj, Mata and Memphis all of whom are capable of providing a goal threat. Fellaini creates space by forcing the opponents to defend crosses, and drawing defenders to him - I would expect the aforementioned players to thrive in that space.

91~~~
That chest control though..

92~~~
Fellaini is a last resort option and I'm afraid nothing more. 

He lacks the technical ability to thrive long term in our system. He did well for a few games last season and then was found out. 

Fellaini limits our play far too much and if you stop the supply to him then you really cut the efficiency of the team.

Sorry buddy but I don't agree. Carroll as a footballer is actually underrated. Now I'm not saying he is good enough to play for a big club but he's better with the ball than people give him credit for. Part of the reason that he's struggled in teams is because they lump the ball up to him. 

Fellaini always looks way off the pace. He's too slow and what we need is speed not to slow things down even more.

93~~~
Exactly what I and others say about Fellaini.

94~~~
He's miles behind Ozil and Silva sorry. Cazorla too.

95~~~
Silva I agree with, but Ozil and Cazorla are not miles ahead of him.

96~~~
Mata isnt a no 10, his best position is second striker. They are all no 10's and are actually playmakers, Mata isnt a play maker.

97~~~
Fellaini as a footballer is underrated

98~~~
At his best he requires a man marker or he will wreak absolute havok. Teams struggle with him because there's always that reluctance to sacrifice a player. I think our best football last season came when Fellaini's wrecking ball physical presence made space for Herrera and Mata to strut their stuff.

99~~~
He definitely still has a role to play here. Not saying he will be a starter but he can be super-effective at times. We have seen that last year. I hope he gets minutes tomorrow because having him up to speed will be real useful for us this season.

100~~~
Silva maybe just, the other two no chance.

101~~~
Mata isnt really a no 10, Ozil has always been better than him though. And Cazorla keeps Mata out of the national team. As the 2nd striker role, Mata surpasses them all when on form, he"s deadly in tbe final third. But he js no playmaker.

102~~~
I think swapping Silva for Mata would make City significantly weaker, and us quite a bit stronger. Same for Arsenal, if Cazorla was swapped. Ozil - not so much. But I'd still say he's better than Mata.

Other than finishing and set-pieces (even then, it's really just the shooting part), Silva is better than Mata at almost everything.

103~~~
You're being pedantic. "Second striker" and "number 10" are virtually the same thing. As far as stats for playmaking Mata is second only to Silva so your point is completely invalid.

104~~~
Only that it really isnt. 

And know he isnt, he hasnt got more assists nor chances created compared to Ozil. Doubt to Cazorla too. He has 8 assists in 1.5 years at the club. Not too impressive. Set pieces included which has no relevance with playmaking.

105~~~
I actually think sadly that if we sign Pedro that Fellaini will put Mata out the side, and Pedro/Memphis will be the options out wide with Fellaini as a #10.

106~~~
I'd agree that Carroll is underrated as a footballer, but he is slower and more cumbersome than Fellaini imo, and doesn't have the same level of control, passing ability or tactical intelligence. What he does have though, is better technique - his ability to strike the ball, his power and accuracy are very much underrated.

I think generally opinions on Fellaini are distorted by the type of football that he thrives under. Everyone wants to see a slick passing, enthusiastic, vibrant, attacking team, myself included. But right now we probably aren't quite capable of that, as we don't have the World class #9 required. Januzaj could well be eventually, but in the meantime I'd like to see Fellaini, Wilson and Adnan all used in that role. I'd rather use Fellaini up top than sign another forward unless it is a player of Lewandowski/Benzema quality.

107~~~
I wonder if Fellaini might become LVG's preferred choice at no.10 (second striker) now he is fit again?  We may find out tonight.

108~~~
Surprisingly I'm happy to see him play for us.

109~~~
You are right, that is surprising. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

110~~~
Comes up with the goods yet again!!

111~~~
9 goals in last 14 appearances for club and country.

The striker evolution is upon us. I welcome it.

112~~~
YES!!!!!!

113~~~
What a man.

114~~~
You beautiful bastard.

115~~~
I love him and would love to have babies with him.

116~~~
I gave him alot of flack the first season but this guy has been a beast under LvG. Important goal.

117~~~
That's how he should be used, late on if in trouble and up front.

118~~~
hell of a weapon to have!

makes the second leg a heck of a different proposition now!

119~~~
The right man when you need a goal. Time and again. It's just hard to stop him in the air!

120~~~
What a guy

121~~~
We should make a "Fellaini should start" thread !!!!!

122~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I wanted to tag you. I criticize him but I wouldn't sell him or ostracize him.

123~~~
Brilliant decision by LvG.

Fellana should be mostly used as a sub. He always finds himself in position to score or chest down the ball for possession.

124~~~
He's a big character.. strong mentally.

125~~~
More in 5 minutes than Rooney in 3 games. He has come up with the goods on a good amount of occasions for us now, well done Marouane.

126~~~
Great option to have.

127~~~
Our boy's back

128~~~
Remember when you all thought he was shit.

129~~~
I was waiting for the influx of "xxx has tagged you" alerts as soon as I saw it go in.

Just gone and poured myself another Pina Colada to celebrate <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

130~~~
I would gladly try him instead of Rooney in next few games as a striker. 

Btw, nice goal. I liked it because he scored not because he is tall but because his movement was good. There was lot of crosses during the game where Rooney was always second to ball in similar situations.

131~~~
'Anywhere on his head and he's mustard.'

132~~~
Would do a better job up top than Rooney on that evidence. Pleased for him.

133~~~
Said it since he signed.

While he might not be everyone's cup of tea, he's a very, very useful player to have in a squad, and is here on merit.

134~~~
Feck it maybe he should start up top if we don't get a striker in. Good option to have off the bench though. I much prefer him in that role as a threat up front off the bench or also as an option to add some steel if we need it, rather than having him start.

135~~~
I declared my love way before the goal though. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

136~~~
Quality from LVG

Brugge down to ten, prob going to tighten it up at the back, 'Big lad go stand at the back post and we'll ping balls at you to get the third'

Then he did an all xD

137~~~
Exactly. An excellent option to have. As good as plan B as they come. Great character too.

138~~~
Also, i wonder how many fans that booed him in his first game of last season were cheering him in the first game of this season? Funny game, football.

139~~~
Afro beast to the rescue!

140~~~
What a way to come back. Needed that.

141~~~
His directness and tanacity is something we are missing at times. Maybe it's time to give him another shot as our man behind Rooney?

142~~~
Great header. Looked up for it when he came in.

It's in situations like this where he shows how useful he can be. Luckily it seems we've gone away from using him in a conventional CM role, and we're utilizing him as the AM/support striker he always should've been.

Still doesn't want him to start for us in most matches, although with Rooney's current form...

143~~~
I love having him here. He's a great weapon to have. He gives it his all for us.

144~~~
Moyes was pretty ignorant to play him in midfield. Fellaini has always been a beast in the 10/striker role. However, the concern he brings is that our main source of creativity will be apparent and easily voided like how Mourinho counter last season and Ferguson did when he was at Everton.

145~~~
Legend. I'd prefer him up top over Rooney. Knew he'd score.

146~~~
As in second choice striker or as a number 10?

147~~~
He wanted that. Top cameo.

148~~~
Wonderful option to have. hes a boss. Hes our Benteke <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

149~~~
He's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. So we'll boo him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A tall mop of goals.

150~~~
We've definitely missed him.

151~~~
He's back!!!!!! Like I said, when he's available for selection in the EPL, he'll be used quite often, in my opinion.

152~~~
Well said, Jim.

153~~~
As a second striker.

154~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

155~~~
All those 'stills, buts, althoughs, even thoughs', fecking love it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

156~~~
Agreed.

157~~~
Our number 10 plays on the right. Naturally he is more of a second striker than a play maker. We need to make sure though that this doesn't lead to only long balls being lumped towards him.

158~~~
He did well tonight, deserved that goal

159~~~
That never happened.

You can't prove it !

Go away!

160~~~
I meant the traditional number 10 position. Where out number 10 should be playing but philosophy and what not.

161~~~
I didn't.

Any way, glad that he is back on a high note.

162~~~
Fellaini and Hernandez upfront together would be lethal. Pace and strength - a classic big man - small man combo.

163~~~
To be fair, that was a few gimps in a pre-season game. I feel that incident was wildly over stated. He got booed by a pathetic minority and went on to be a key player in several games, think it worked out ok for him.

164~~~
Think everyone agreed he was a shit signing considering it what obvious that Moyes brought him in as a midfielder where at the highest level he is totally outclassed. He's a striker.

165~~~
He entered like a battering ram, ran all over the place causing Brugge players to loose their heads and in the end he scored. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

166~~~
Well it's quite obvious that Fellaini isn't a traditional number 10. LvG likes to play a shadow striker, or deep lying striker, or whoever you may call it, main reason we were offering 100M for Müller, because he is probably the prefect player for the way LvG wants us to play. The creative part will be more or less distributed to the wide areas with Memphis and Mata having to do the heavy lifting here and naturally a deep lying play maker like Carrick or Schweinsteiger.

167~~~
I fecking love him.

168~~~
He just causes mayhem for teams when he plays up top. Nobody is tall enough to deal with him. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any room in the team to have him as a consistent starter though

169~~~
I know that, I never said he was.

170~~~
He'll never win over some people ..but thats fine..to go from that admittedly terrible season, and to pull himself up , thats the fighting spirit that I admire..I will not mention any names, but some deserters could have learnt a thing or to from that..

171~~~
He's becoming a favourite of mine, absolutely love the guy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

172~~~
Van Gaal: "He [Fellaini] does it very often with me." <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> talking about the 3rd goal.

173~~~
To be honest, he was our long-awaited CM signing and he clearly isn't and wasn't the midfielder we wanted and needed at that time. But I am glad he found his place here, a great option to have <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

174~~~
For some time I thought he simply was a miss match for our team but hated the amount of stick he got on here every game he played. Also he started to look much better once we moved him higher up the field and I still feel that's where he actually is at his best. Putting pressure on our opponents high up the pitch, chasing down defenders and getting into their face. He also is the only real physical presence we have in an advanced position.

175~~~
Might sound a little crazy, but should we draw Barca at whatever point, could we stick him up front? Can't see Mascherano getting anywhere near him in the air if he's at CB.

176~~~
Well than why did you ask if he should be played as a second striker or a 10? I'm afraid I don't really get what you wanted to know?

177~~~
I think a lot of context has to be taken as well. We over-payed for him on the last day of the transfer window during a thoroughly underwhelming transfer window. We then went on to be completely shit under Moyes with Fellaini putting in more than a few poor performances in a piss poor midfield.

Yes, he got slated but pretty much everyone did that season. It was a truly horrid few months for the club and Fellaini became the poster boy of our demise due to his Moyes connection. It's hardly as simplistic as 'everyone thought he was shit' - I hate all that crap being brought up to rub it in people's faces. Their were clearly many extenuating factors that season that made people judge several of our players quite harshly.

Anyhow, Fellaini came through the adversity and was very good at times last season. As I previously said, he's a good option to have.

178~~~
A minority? Don't think so at all and it was disgusting but came off the back of a lot of fans lack of patience. Reminded me of thw moans when Fletchers name used to be read out. 

It's great to have someone with his qualities in the team and his rise from being taunted to loved is something to enjoy

179~~~
Herrera should be worried for his playing time. Can see Fellaini taking over that #10 role within a few games. The guy has got his goalscoring boots/Afro on.

180~~~
Very happy for Fellaini.

Glad to see he is becoming a royal pain in the ass for our rivals, just like he was a royal pain in the ass against us 99% of the time.

181~~~
Can't do much more on such a short cameo. Brilliant performance, especially considering he's not featured during the pre-season or the start of the season. I wouldn't mind seeing him start if Memphis can keep being consistent with his crossing.

182~~~
He was bought as our midfield savior. If anything his recent form as a no.10/striker/lump up front proves further that that was the wrong decision.

But he is a very useful option for us, no doubt.

183~~~
I was just thinking he could be a similar type of player to Benteke...will be interesting to see how LVG uses him this season.

184~~~
Yes I condemn the booing but it certainly was a minority and it was a meaningless pre-season match. Footballers get booed, it's pathetic, but it's life. Anyhow, no need to debate semantics. I feel the booing thing was over stated but I certainly condemn it. I just can't get hysterical like some did about it.

Onto Fellaini a season later; he's proven to be a great option and has turned things around. Fair play to him.

185~~~
Isn't it crazy, the guy has 8 minutes and makes a goal. Rooney must be pulling his perm.

186~~~
Such an unorthodox player. Can't remember any game since the Moyes era where he has come on & not looked like a threat.

What I don't understand is that he was so effective under Moyes at Everton playing off the front man, yet he brought him to United & stuck him in defensive midfield. 

LVGs ability to turn his game & confidence round simply by playing him in his correct position just shows how much of a nightmare Moyes had here.

187~~~
Moyes was more worried about what people would say rather than doing what he knew was right

188~~~
He adds that much needed height up front. The rest of our forwards are tiny so it's nice to have Fellaini cause some havoc in the opponents box.

189~~~
Honestly it isnt like we are going to outplay Barca along the ground, so I would absolutely support this - we will be forced to play it long with or without Fellaini, might as well have someone who can get on the end of things.

190~~~
What an absolute beast this man can be when used correctly. On his day he reminds me of one of them daft overpowered players on fifa what an impact he had for us tonight great to see him turn his career around.

191~~~
I'd play him up top. That way they can't stick a midfielder on him to man mark him. He can take on the weaker CB.

192~~~
I think he showed us today. Especially if we get an injury to Schneiderlin we may have to use him to create back some balance in the selection like we did last season

193~~~
He isn't a box to box player or a dm, not at this level anyway but as an attacking player he is a very different and good option. Game was perfectly set up for him when he came on, they were tired and camped deep in their half and last thing the needed was fellaini coming on.

I still wouldn't start him regularly as a number ten or a striker because I think he will be more effective in moderation but he could be our new super sub.

194~~~
So....

------------Fellaini-------------
Memphis----Rooney----Pedro

Is that a realistic option for anyone? Could be a brilliant premiership front four, at least until the top striker we are desperate for becomes available. Rooney and Fellaini are likely to swap but it could be deadly against the weaker defences.

195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> have you tried him in FIFA? He's ace in every position!

196~~~
I do. What a shocker that the Caf got it wrong eh?

197~~~
Wouldnt be the worst idea ever. Wouldnt matter though if we cant stop Messi.

198~~~
He was ace away at Liverpool for us. First time in years we were able to dominate at Anfield. All because when we were under pressure we could just lump it up to him and he would win it. Long ball is frowned upon because usually its 50:50 on a really good day but with Fellaini he seems to be able to win 85% of balls played into him at chest level.

199~~~
His should've won a penalty just before that too, after taking down that cross field pass in the box.

200~~~
To be fair, we also all thought David Moyes was shit and we got that one right.

201~~~
This time last year I really hated seeing him in the team. I thought he was clueless, cumbersome and completely killed any pace and fluidity in our attack. He really is one of my favourites now. If van Gaal gets things right he will only be a squad player, but there are few squad players that can offer what he can. Brilliant attitude too - one of the few in the team that you can call fiercely competitive. Him and Hernández as super subs is pretty fantastic tbh.

202~~~
Remember when you said he was an excellent midfielder? I am not sure if it was you, but I remember an Everton supporter on here said he was an excellent midfielder, but the season under Moyes where he played that role, he was incredibly poor.

Anyway, I did call him a word similiar to shit, but that was because he was a very very average midfielder and I said he was a better second striker or target men.

203~~~

204~~~
Incredibly useful player to have for the last 20 minutes of a game, defensively or attacking.

205~~~
He's a useful player to have.

Doesn't mean you'd want him in the starting XI week in and week out, but as a squad player he's excellent.  You can use him as LVG did today to change the game when you're chasing a goal or looking for a commanding aerial presence.  He's also capable of stepping in to the starting XI and putting in a quality shift when required.  Technically he's not the greatest, but he is solid at maintaining possession and getting the ball to more creative players.

206~~~

207~~~
He is a very good midfielder - for Everton he could play in that role as a 2 or a 3 man midfield. At United playing in a 2 man midfield was possibly a step too far for him but he's still been very good for you in a box-to-box role at times. Best suited at United in a 3 man midfield, or as a second striker.

208~~~
1) Fellaini and Mascherano would probably both get sent off.

2) Against Barcelona I think Louis we'll do a Netherlands vs Spain, set up his team to defend and so use Young as LW, invite them on and then a long ball quickly to get Rooney and Memphis in a 2 v 2 situation with Pedro and Young running up quickly to support. Fellaini would be interesting but it's hard to pass quickly from deep and get it somewhere close to him, it's probably easier to pass it somewhere in all that space.

209~~~
From what I have seen, I would gladly assert the contrary. The season we played under Moyes, he played in that midfield role and even the likes of Scholes was aghast with some of his performances and why he was not played as a second striker. In a three man midfield at the tip of the three, he will be great as he can be a bully in our midfield aswell(e.g. suffoco), but as a natural central midfield or holding midfielder, he is average and I can not see that changing as his footballing attributes holds him back from excelling in that role.

210~~~
He barely had to move when that cross came in it was that good <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

211~~~
I agree with this. He was decent in a 3 man midfield at times last season. 

Another important goal that he has scored. I have a feeling that (despite the red card) van Gaal has a lot of trust in Fellaini to do the job he asks. Moreso than some other players in the squad.

212~~~
I thought that last season he was excellent in a 3-man midfield alongside Herrera, with a dedicated holding player behind him.

213~~~
Guy has been setting the place on fire and the haters come out with "well... he's still a crap midfielder". He had some good games in midfield last season as well. Even for Everton he regularly played well in the middle of the park.

It doesn't matter for us since we have really good midfielders, but people will do anything on here to discredit the big man.

214~~~
Some people do not want to hear the truth, I understand. The fact is that Fellaini best performances has come from him playing as a number ten in a tip of a midfield three or second striker since his Everton days. If you can give me fact that showed he was better as a midfielder not as a 10 or a second striker, I would gladly admit that I was wrong which rarely happens.

I do not want to be a party pooper, but I have to defend my integrity since I clarified that he was average before. I am just glad Van Gaal figured out how to use him properly, which is ironic since Moyes knows him best and failed to use him properly.

215~~~
The best player in the world at what he does. If we use him the right way, no team in Europe would be able to handle him.

216~~~
OK...

217~~~
Figures.  So appropriate.

Something has gone terribly wrong if this is the case more often than not.  Still, nice to see the big man score.

218~~~
Well you say yourself that his best performaces came playing in a midfield 3 so I dont really understand this comment? He has actually very rarely started any games as second striker for us, he has ended up further upfront at times when we have been chasing games but the games he started last season were virtually always as a midfielder, albeit an attacking one.

219~~~
Using him up front feels like the sort of cheap exploit you find in FIFA. It's jammy as hell, but it fecking works.

220~~~
i cry everytime he scores a goal.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's a "last 20 mns" player to me.

221~~~
Ha!, actually you could be right, great guy to have on the bench to change things.

222~~~
How is it 'jammy'?

223~~~
I didn't have an issue with constructive criticism as much as with the continuous attacks by some people even after good displays by him. If a player, any player for that matter, is playing well, then let him roll. His first year with us wasn't good and I don't think that there is much debate about that. But, how many players had a good season under Moyes? I mean, heck, we finished 7th in the table. For some, he was an easy target, and for others he seemed as a symptom of the bad Moyes' reign at Old Trafford. 

But, he progressed and showed what a true professional player should do: work hard and wait for your opportunity, which he did since the WBA game last season. What's truly amazing about him though is that his goals are always important. I actually can't remember a goal of him where I said "well, the game is over any way". He is always there when you need him. I'm also encouraged by the fact that, as with WBA last season, he didn't need much time today to get going-- played 10 good minutes and scored a goal. The defense seems to panic when he is around and that is really a weapon that we should be utilizing throughout the season. How many teams can play with the likes of Rooney and Hernandez up front, on one hand, and with a fellow like Fellaini, on the other? The flexibility that he brings to our attack is priceless! 

I guess the question moving forward will be how and when to use him. Well, if we qualify to the UCL and don't lose so early in the cups , then we will have more games to play this season. With 50+ games, we can offer him enough chances in the starting lineup and as a sub.

224~~~
Maybe jammy isn't the right word, but swinging crosses in at a player like Fellaini will always feel like a cheaper way to get goals and to win games for someone like me, who prefers turning defences dizzy with good attacking play, quick passes and skill.

Not that I'm complaining. I went primal when that third goal went in today. Such an important goal to have before the away leg.

225~~~
As of right now, would have him over Rooney and I don't like Fellaini at all.

Would rather see someone up there making their presence known, able to hold off a man and bring others into a game. And if Memphis can launch whipped crosses like that, Fellaini will actually score goals too.

Sure he's no striker, but the captain barely looks like a footballer at the moment.

226~~~
I said the tip of a midfield three which can basically be seen as the number ten or second striker. E.g.


Defending it was shaped as a three, but attacking he was the targetman(second striker) or forward destroyer as this article describe.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://thefalse9.com/2015/03/fellaini-revels-in-his-new-forward-destroyer-role.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thefalse9.com/2015/03/fellaini-revels-in-his-new-forward-destroyer-role.html</a>
He started the mass majority of our game in that forward destroyer role under Van Gaal, whereas under Moyes he started much deeper where his performance was not as good.

227~~~
Deserves to be here.

228~~~
Good sub performance. 10 minutes and 2-3 decent chances, one converted.

229~~~
I agree with this. He mostly played in an attacking position, not as a second striker.

His position changed a lot between and within games. For example, against West Ham, we pushed him up front while chasing the equaliser. In the 2nd game Liverpool, he drifted a lot backwards and defended virtually every set piece they had towards the end of the game. In the first Liverpool game, he played in a defensive position (a la Carick). In our big win against City, he played in the left wing in an attacking position in the Young-Blind-Fellaini triangle. It's actually hard to think about a player who played in multiple positions as he did last season.

230~~~
What was his seven fingers celebration all about?

231~~~
Well I dont agree with that statement in the first place, being part of a midfield 3 is not the same role as second striker (I prefer to avoid the term 'number 10' as it means different things in different formations). Check the average position charts from last season and most of the time there were 3 players (usually Young, Mata and Rooney) further forward than Fellaini, and Fellaini was often in line with Herrera, that is why to me it was very much a midfield role and not a second striker at all. 

Later in the season we rarely set up like your 2nd formation anyway, it was virtually always the former with 1 holiding player and then 2 more midfielders in front of him and those 2 had both attacking and defensive responsibilities. This season is different as LvG has decided to play with 2 more defensive midfielders and then 4 attacking players including a second striker

232~~~
True indeed, in fact players under LvG often shift around even within games as he has different set ups depending on whether we or the opposition have the ball. People remember Fellaini being around the box so they decide he was playing off the striker, when in reality it is not that simple and he is often covering a lot more of the pitch and putting in a defensive shift when needed.

233~~~
Being part of the midfield three can mean you can be part of the forward role. If you are are familiar with the term suffoco, that is basically a second striker who joins the midfield while defending to add number in midfield. As I already stated that is what Fellaini does at the tip of the midfield and that was the role he played most of the time for Van Gaal last season, which is why his performance was noteworthy.

If you believe he is a better midfielder than he is a second striker or number 10, then your opinion is that similiar to Moyes who came to that same conclusion and made Fellaini look like a comedy show during his tenure.

234~~~
Used tonight exactly how I think we should always use him, great hail Mary option, his lay-off and run to get into position was very good.

235~~~
Put him on top with Pedro, Memphis and Mata behind him and let Schweini play those long balls to him all day long. He will chest it, head it, to anyone around him!! 

Love his attitude, he really looks like a player who does not want to get sidelined regardless of big name signing we do. Plus it is just the start of the season. If we get into CL, he will get more playing time in cup competitions.

236~~~
That's the thing that I noticed the most. I think he clearly loves being a United player -- wouldn't surprise me of he was a supporter as a kid.

Not the most elegant player we have ever had to grace OT  but you can't fault his efforts. Gary Neville of the Afro world.

He has grown on me.

237~~~
Those who slated him before last season were made to reluctantly eat their words. Even before this season starrted, those same fools went to slating him again, I guess in a hopeless attempt to convince themselves that they were right afterall. Guess again, you were wrong, Fellaini IS United quality. GTFI.

238~~~
I've said before that I think he should be played as a target man. I believe that even more now that we've got a functioning midfield.

Fellaini has a good touch and good technique, but slow feet and a lack of vision. The only position that makes sense for him is one in which he plays with his back to goal and lays off simple passes. We wouldn't necessarily need to play high balls to him, either. His upper body strength is good enough for him to hold the ball up for the likes of Depay, Mata and (possibly) Pedro to make runs past him. The passes would be relatively easy that high up the pitch. He could be brilliant.

Even if we're only playing one up front, I still think we'll need at least 3 strikers. That's always the way international squads have been picked. Rooney, Fellaini and Hernandez should be our 3.

239~~~
Must have been a reference to 'Karl Pilkington sees the seven wonders of the world', or an Idiot Abroad which they named it, him being a Manc and all that. Probably his fave tv show.

240~~~
He can be our false 9 but he offers something that is very unique in football.

241~~~
Did his job excellently, teams cant deal with his physicallly so hes a great option to have on the bench but nothing more than that.

242~~~
Great performance profile picture for Fellaini!

He was always going to score in a game like yesterdays. He is a very good weapon to use at the end of games when you play smaller players. A lot of players in Club Brugge were a bit too young to play a game like this. They did really well though.

243~~~
That's so wrong! If the big guy does a job then he should start. He was more effective than Mata and Rooney combined!

244~~~
Hes not good enough to start for Manchester United, we should have a higher calibre of players in our squad and now we do. We have better players at the DM, CM and AM/SS roles so why should he start? Mata is playing on the right and doing well so I dont know what you're talking about. Rooney has been shit but surely you dont think Fellaini should play as a striker.

Hes a great option to have coming on from the bench when shit hits the fan but we shouldnt be relying on him to start.

245~~~
Mata looks like a fish on a bike at right wing and is clogging up our attack. Great wee player but not in that position. I'd rather have Fellaini. If you want style over substance fair enough but right now and last season Fellaini deserves his starting berth and we are a better team with him in the 11. Unless we sign Pedro (Muller or some other fantasy player) Fellaini will replace Mata! You can see this coming surely?

246~~~
Fellaini as a right winger? Are you serious? On the wings you need tricky/pacey players I dont even think Mata should be playing there let alone fecking Fellaini! If we're talking about deserving things surely no one deserves to start more than Herrera but the system just doesnt suit him so it is what it is. Fellaini is a sub for the second striker position when all else has failed simple as that.

247~~~
I agree 100% but we have Mata currently who offers little flashes. Fellaini will end up there and add an option with Depay crossing to him like he did last season on the left side. Mata currently needs either moved inside or taken out the team. Herrera hopefully replaces Adnan also and we revert to a 433. If Pedro signs it will be Mata he replaces.

248~~~
I cant see LvG changing the system unless this one stops working he may devise a secondary system as a backup. Pedro will play on the right when/if he comes and if Memphis will keep his place on the left this means that Januzaj, Herrera, Fellaini and hopefully Mata will fight for the second striker position. I find it odd that van Gall doesnt see Mata as a second striker thats actually his best position hes a really good finisher.

249~~~
Could be the 'surprise striker' that van Gaal was referring to in pre-season.

250~~~
Yep I agree with 10 being Mata's best position and I think he will end up there if we buy Pedro and in the tougher games it will be Herrera or Fellaini in that 10 to give us more solidarity and physical presence. Fellaini is well under rated on the cafe imo. He's not pretty but he sure is effective and teams struggle against him and this frees up other players in our team.

251~~~
It's good to have him as an option for crosses toward the end of games but it's annoying how we seem to constantly play the long ball when he's on the pitch instead of as a last resort.

252~~~
Terrific player to have in your squad. A nightmare to play against when he's in form. Makes you wonder why we bothered for so long trying to fit him in as a central midfielder when everything about his game is perfectly suited to a target man.

253~~~
I wasn't able to pay loads of attention to the match but it looked like we were doing it well before he was on the pitch to be fair, wasn't as noticeable though because it didn't work.

254~~~
We didn't play long ball when he was on the pitch. This is a Louis van Gaal team we're talking about.

We played crosses into the box when Fellaini came on, but then we were doing that all game anyway.

255~~~
This!

256~~~
I don't get the problem with long balls to him. Most of the time, they're not hopeful punts up their hoping for a flick on. Most of them are pretty well measured, and he takes them down easy enough, keeps the ball and helps us moving into the opposition half. His goal came from a 'long ball' which he took down, laid off wide and then got in the box for a header.

257~~~
He's a dude.

258~~~
I agree with what you are saying, but it really irks me when people call a cross a "long ball". A cross is a cross. Or at least it would be if anyone other than Fellaini was on the end of it.

259~~~
2+7 yeah, his hold up play would be much better than Rooney's and neither Rooney or Fellaini can take on players.. Fellaini is great in the air unlike Rooney who is a bit average, both player can fight for the ball, Fellaini's a bit better defensively, in case we need to defend more, Fellaini can go deep and Adnan up top or whoever plays in the hole.. Rooney's only better at pinging the balls around from deep positions and is more creative overall but Fellaini seem more effective now..

yes talking about no9 position

260~~~
Not at all - because Moyes played him as a more defensive midfielder, whereas I think he is best suited to a less restrictive midfield role where he can contribute to both defence and attack. That is also where he plays for Belgium most of the time - its more like no8 than no10, perhaps even something just inbetween which is why it is difficult to categorise it.

BTW Ive never heard the term 'suffoco'

261~~~
Any explanation to the number seven during the celebration?

262~~~
I think carrick did the same thing when he scored against Spurs last season with his head. Could be an inside joke

263~~~
Indeed.
The difference was that when he came on, we had a player who had the ability to get on the end of incoming balls being hit into the penalty box.
Rooney should be able to deal with these...but in his current form, he cant. He did have 1 attempt (remember that bicycle kick which happened because his back was to goal).

I think someone earlier summed it up perfectly: in last nights game, our opposition were using kids. When a fully grown man arrived on the pitch, they could not handle it and within 10 minutes, they buckled.

264~~~
Memphis maybe? I just came to ask this same thing. He kind of ran away from all the people celebrating and ran over in front of the bench as well.

265~~~
I thought that but he's in a picture with Herrera in the dressing room post-game gesturing the same again.

266~~~
Fair enough, maybe he has a personal reason like a fan or something.

267~~~
Didn't he score 7 goals last year? Or am I just talking out of my ass?

268~~~
With the  Memphis experiment at 10 seemingly over..Mata likely remaining on the right, and perreira not yet ready and van gaal having gone on record that he prefers a second foward rather than a third midfielder, i expect that it will be a straight shootout between him and Januzaj for the number 10 spot...and i think he'll probably win out due to the fact that he currentlys offer more in terms of output than Adnan

269~~~
The thing I like about Fellaini is that he is a threat to ANY side. I just wish he'd had some more pace, mobility and better technique. It would make him one of the best strikers in the world.

270~~~
He has scored 7 goals since he signed.

271~~~
I think Januzaj suits the second striker style 4-2-3-1 type of 10. Fellaini is much more suited to that wide 4-3-3 role 10 where he gets free and he gets into the box. I assume Fellaini will get his chance to play this 4-2-3-1 type of 10 and I suspect he'll do well, his all round game is criminally underrated. You could barely get the ball off him last season.

272~~~
Pace sure I can agree with.

He is actually quite mobile though - it just doesn't look it because he's not exactly a "pretty" runner and because of his size, but he actually moves around quite well.

Also his technique shouldn't be underestimated. Is he gonna play defence splitting passes? Of course not, but facets that are a part of technique are things like ball control, and he really does have great ball control both at the feet or in the air. What I like about him is that you get some big guys who win headers and beat their opponent to the ball. But Fellaini will more often then not not only win those headers and physical battles, but keep the ball or play a good header/pass to a team mate. It's not just that he wins them, he is productive from them too.

I'm glad he is an option in our squad. I don't want him to start of course unless there is a special reason for it, but he can make a difference as a substitute in a number of situations.

Thanks!

273~~~
Whether he is a better midfielder or not is a debate I'm not arguing. I just don't agree with the notion that he is a bad midfield player and belongs up top. He has had some really good games in the middle of the park. People are looking for ways to discredit him and the "he sucks as a midfielder" one is the most ridiculous way one can do it. 

I also don't think Moyes misused him. It was just a bad season for him (and almost everyone). He was low on confidence and in a new club struggling to get anything done.

274~~~
Didn't do too well, can't remember hearing his name mentioned. 0/10

275~~~
I can't tell if you are serious or trying to be funny? Either way...

276~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

277~~~
Appears at press conference but plays 0 minutes.

278~~~
Exactly, in the build up we're all debating him playing as our new striker for the season. Don't know what he must have done in that 24hrs.

279~~~
Diversion...misdirection

280~~~
He didn't do anything. He just didn't play.

281~~~
He did more in 15 minutes as a striker than Rooney did all game.

At least he has a presence and occupies the centre-half.

Would be far more effective if the referees didn't penalise him everytime he goes near the ball and allow the opposition to do whatever they want, too.

282~~~
Don't want either to be our main striker.  Hate that our only option now is we either lump it up or cross it to Fellaini when we're chasing a goal.  Fecking painful to watch.  Felt like I was watching Moyes against Fullham with all the aimless crossing towards the end there.  Can't believe it's come to this.

283~~~
Talk about a complete 180 from me, but I want him to start every game.

284~~~
Feel a bit bad for him. Anytime he comes on as a sub, we just give up playing our passing game and just lump it up to him, the tactic has become so predictable that the opposition has half the team around him to mark him out, not much he can do in such a case.

285~~~
I don't get it too. Just pass the ball to his feet and he'd hold it up rather than hoofing it constantly. 

That six game run last season showed that.

286~~~
It is obviously instructions from the manager ,  just do not understand why we don't mix it up more rather than being so predictable.

287~~~
Because LVG clearly prefers to be a an unimaginative moron for all this spouting of philosophy.

288~~~
He's an effective option but my heart sinks whenever he comes on...it's like a death knell to the (albeit slim) hope of us playing some good, attractive football.

289~~~
We didn't use him properly when he came on. Too often we tried finding him from deep. What we should have been doing is getting to advanced positions in wide areas more often before crossing into him.

290~~~
He did as much as he could tbh. Some real shocking balls hit towards him even from our defenders. We just abandoned everything to hit it towards his head / sometimes over and all he can try and do is knock it down. And even then nobody ran close to him to pick up the second ball. Bonkers stuff.

He really should have come on for Rooney, left Mata on, and brought on Young for memphis.

291~~~
This is the awful part. We just need to move the ball well enough to produce a decent cross for him to attack, but because we can't consistently pin the other team's to within 25-30 yards of the other team's goal, we hit 50 yards ball at him. 

We play possession football, which is fine, but then we need to be pinning the other team deep and close enough to produce something.

292~~~
Aye, no matter how useful an option he could potentially be up front, I can't help but feel like it's going to be a dire season if we're regularly planning to use Fellaini as an option up front.

293~~~
Hoofing balls onto Fellaini from a distance is too hit and miss. We're basically telegraphing a tactic for opposition teams to set-up to counter his game.

294~~~
I hate it when he comes on and we just start to hoof it up everytime we have the ball, it is our panic button and is horrible and embarrasing  to watch.

Start him instead in the no10 and make him an option, not the one and only answer.

295~~~
Saw why he should t play every week, percentage football is easy to stop, worrying thing is it may be our best option given the lack of talent in the final third.

296~~~
He seemed vaguely ineffective which was probably down to his marker being handcuffed to him the entire time.

297~~~
Agree completely.

I feel sorry for Fellaini because he'll cop the stick for the football we played at the end, but really it is the instructions to the team. The aimless punts from deep were just silly - they weren't even accurate! Should have kept working it out side and getting some crosses in.

298~~~
Clearly he did what he was told and competed for the hit and hope balls lobbed in his vicinity the best he could as most of them lacked accuracy.

299~~~
Had we kept Di Maria and played him, Fellaini could have scored for fun imo. But neither Memphis nor Mata are suited to him. I hope Chicharito gets anther shot, he is fits in better on paper.

300~~~
Every player would be more effective if the ref would let their fouling go on unpunished. I don't know if there's a player out there that fouls as much as Fellaini.

301~~~
Somebody tell him.

302~~~
Use him behind the striker, he can play with his back to goal. The striker up front should focus on making runs behind the defender together with Memphis. Mata can use him as a link up when moving central. Also, we would have an aerial threat which we have lacked.

303~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/w1ih" width="560"></iframe>

His goal against Bosnia

304~~~
He's absolutely lethal for Belgium.

305~~~
I hope we can use him more often, he is an absolute beast at times. Scores goals for fun for Belgium.

306~~~
I've got no issue with using him as long as we have technical, pacey attackers around him.

307~~~
Knew he'd scored..this thread seems to be bumped everytime he's on international duty because of that..goal scoring machine for Belgium..and with our goal situation, we can do with more of that too.

308~~~
That is some hilarious defending, The 4 defenders who go for that ball get it woefully wrong.

Brave header though. Looked close to getting a boot in the mouth.

309~~~
Star striker in the making. Get used to it folks. Beast! 

10 in 16 now isn't it? If that was Rooney or Januzaj this place would be going crazy.

310~~~
In his last 16 or just for Belgium? Some would argue why Rooney's the best striker in the world and why Januzaj is a better talent than Messi was.

311~~~
His opportunities probably got worse with the signing of Martial even taking into account the departures of Chicharito and Januzaj.

312~~~
Club and country mate

313~~~
Think both United and Belgium

314~~~
I don't think so. Van Gaal doesn't seem to be one who cares about a player's price tag - we saw that with Di Maria last season.

315~~~
People for some reason laugh at this, but his chest control really is top class.

316~~~
Genuinely would do a job up top with Rooney playing like he is. That control is absolutely top class.

317~~~
I hear what you're saying, but LVG will be under tremendous pressure to play Martial because of circumstance in addition to his price tag.  For better or worse, Martial was brought in to help immediately and not as a prospect.  LVG hitched his horse to that wagon, and his tenure as United manager might very well depend on how he performs.

318~~~
I concur.

He can't stop scoring when given the opportunity. Play him, Louis!

319~~~
The problem atm is when we bring Fellani on, we just go route 1 every single time. Its so fecking stupid. Sure, mix it up when he's on the pitch, play it up high to him at times. But if you're going to do it every single time, it becomes so easy to defend against.

I actually think he could do a decent job upfront (better then Falcao did last season for example) but I don't want us going long ball the second he's on the pitch. Good to see him score again thought, he seems to have the magic touch for Belgium atm.

320~~~
He is such a weird footballer. Looks absolutely shit at times, yet still delivers in scoring crucial goals.

321~~~
Looks awkward and has awkward technique.

He'll end up our #10 for the majority of games this season I bet. He'll be used to bring Martial and Memphis into play.

322~~~
He's such an effective player. He's been our get-out-of-jail card on numerous occasions for the national team. That chest control on the turn was awesome.

323~~~
Well that's because usually he's brought on late because of his ban. If we play Depay and Martial on the wings, suddenly we have options to stretch teams so it should be a good mix - but we'll see. Fact is, playing as we have we've created little.

324~~~
Depay & Martial wouldn't benefit Fellaini playing CF as he wants balls into the box, the two prefer to cut in..

325~~~
When he was in form last season it wasn't even the way we were playing. He was operating with tight control on the left and interplaying with the wing back/fullback really well. People seem to forget this the minute we go to hoofball. I hate it, we all hate it and I agree I have no idea why we do it.

The guy is a really good footballer under all the abuse he cops.

I completely disagree that he could do a decent job up front, he doesn't have the back to goal ability to hold the ball up like a striker (but I suppose he would do better than Rooney as he has more physicality). Sure he can operate okay in that situation but you can tell he doesn't have the explosiveness and the instinctive quick touches needed to survive. He's much more effective when we free his role and allow him to move around between the lines and operate with players coming at him. Up front you just stick a body on him and you essentially make him tussle for the ball and I don't really think that is his strength. His strength is making the defenders come to him and try and spot defend him (if that is such a thing as in not just camp on him and beat him to the ball?) he seems to win a lot of tussles when he is moving to a ball and controlling it, fighting off a challenger and then moving it on (and moving into the box).

326~~~
I won't mind if he starts above Herrera vs Liverpool. He can cause them more damage than Herrera.

327~~~
Nah, I think he has great technique compared to other 6'4 players, and he has a decent technique compared to normal sized midfielders. 

His technique on his chest/head is world class though.

328~~~
Never said he didn't have good technique, just that he looks awkward lol.

329~~~
The Peter Crouch effect. Stick a big man up front and nobody can resist hoofing long balls towards him. I agree and it's actually quite annoying. Everyone just loses all their composure when they have such an obvious target in their eyeline. The big hair doesn't help.

330~~~
Well said.

331~~~
Fellaini 9. Are you ready?

332~~~
Fe9i?

333~~~
Fronaldo.

Il Fellameno.

334~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

335~~~
Fellaini vs Benteke lump off.

336~~~
When we had the run in with like all the big teams right one after the other last season, Fellaini was hugely instrumental in those matches

337~~~
Can we swap our Belgian for theirs?

338~~~
Marouzidane Fellaini would score a goal (probably a header from a Memphis cross), if he starts tomorrow.

339~~~
I would like to see him up top tbh. I think he will be good there, he's proven that before at Everton when he occasionally played there.

340~~~
Was good for Belgium vs Bosnia(he had to do well vs us <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> lol)

Looks like he's starting tomorrow according to some reports. Hopefully does well.

341~~~
He's actually not a bad #10 but he's not a #9, simple as that. I'd much rather see Martial play up front but I don't think LvG will chuck him straight in. Having said that, I do want Fellaini to start as he will definetly cause Liverpool problems and I can see one of Can/Lucas man marking him (to no avail).

342~~~
Ready? Been waiting all season for this.

343~~~
He can't play 9 effectively, not in our system anyway. He's no where near mobile enough for that.

I'd much rather see him number 10 where he's a proven asset. Martial, Memphis or Wilson can play up front and do all the running.

344~~~
I want to see him at the end of Memphis crosses. This might work. Don't think he's worse than Rooney up front anyway, at least he's a constant threat, and you need two players to take care of him. His movement is underrated IMO.
There are things Rooney is better than him but it's been a while since I saw him do it.

345~~~
I have been saying for ages but I think Fellaini could be effective as a 9 <i>in this system</i>.

Ordinarily (eg last season) I was very much opposed to having him up front, and thought he was best deployed alongside Herrera as advanced box-to-box midfielders, with a holding player behind them.

In the current system however, our #10 has mostly been playing almost as a second striker, rather than a playmaker. Additionally, the wide men act as inside forwards. All three players behind the striker therefore are (or should be) making runs, overlapping and basically - scoring goals. In this system, I think some of the key attributes you look for in the striker are the ability to hold the ball up, the ability to bring others into play via flick-ons, and the ability to press the opposing defenders. Fellaini is very good in all of these areas.

What I <i>dont</i> want to happen however, is what happened against Swansea, which is that as soon as Fellaini was on the pitch, we abandoned all efforts to actually play the ball, or work the ball into good crossing positions (what we had been doing for the majority of the game) and instead started lumping it up from anywhere on the pitch. If we are planning on doing that then I would rather just play with 10 men - and I say that as one of Fellaini's most vocal supporters on here.

346~~~
Can we swap you for Jonnowhite?

347~~~
He will score.

Provided we don't just pump long-balls to him and actually pass the ball.

348~~~
You think Fellaini is a better striker then Benteke yeah?

349~~~
Fellani is 194 cm but that doesn't include his hair right? That would get him over 2 meters surely.

350~~~
You think too much.

351~~~
Great work avoiding the question.

352~~~
Would you rather have Fellaini or Origi? or Ings?

353~~~
Fellaini has more goals for Belgium then benteke does.... 

Fellaini is obviously far from ideal as a striker, but benteke is pretty average so I'm glad we didn't go for him really.

354~~~
i have him to start tomorrow. I think he will tear up liverpool.

355~~~
Ings is certainly a better centre forward than Fellaini to be fair.

356~~~
As a striker? Preferably none of them really. 

Ings or Origi because they're not very good. And Fellaini because, well, he's not a striker.

357~~~
Is he? I'd figure they'd both get about 10-12 goals upfront in a full season for us as a main striker (30-32 starts, 4-5 sub apperances), but Fellaini would probably give you better hold up play and knock down for others. Less threat in behind than Ings so the other team can push up a bit more. I think at gunpoint I'd take Fellaini.

358~~~
Why is he set to start today? Did the manager say so? Why not martial?

359~~~
Since you mentioned "Belgian" specifically, please go ahead and check the scoring record of Fellaini and Benteke FOR Belgium in the past 10 games and let us know who has scored more.

OK?

360~~~
And a better run of goals over a certain amount games makes one player better then the other? I guess that means Mahrez must be a better player then Aguero?

Am I doing this right?

361~~~
No sir, you are doing it wrong. you clearly have no idea how it works. 10 Games for your country is a very large sample to chose from. It's  more than 25% league games a player plays in a season and more than 50% a player plays for his country in a season.

If Benteke is so superior to Fellaini in scoring goals, then let us know their scoring records for Belgium in the last 10 games. Never mind - let's increse the pool size & make it 15 games. Now, tell us the number of goals scored by both Belgian players for their country.

Also, do the same for Aguero and Mahrez for 15 games and let us know who come on top. OK?

362~~~
If last season was Fellaini's breakthrough season, I am confident this season is where he will silence his critics once and for all. I can see him being hugely effective upfront. He will start as no.10 and will keep swapping positions with Rooney or we just might go 2 at the top. He will get us 10 goals this season. You heard it here first. C'mon you Belgian beast!!

363~~~
Why? Fellaini would we do that? We have the better player!

364~~~
I don't really get this general thinking of Fellaini being best suited at the Number 9 role.

I would say that he is more suited to role of the striker furthersest up the pitch. He has great first touch, can hold up the play very well, and is superb at winning aerial battles for flick ons to the on running wingers and midfielders.

In the EPL, to have be a successful number 9 player, you need to be able to control the ball in tight spaces, have an eye for the killer pass and be able to execute these passes with great accuracy. I don't think Fellaini has any of these things.

365~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing Fellaini up front. Hopefully he can match consonants elbow for elbow the skin heard Kirsten Stewart lookalike prick.

366~~~
I hope he does well, but I just don't think he's suited to play up front. Question; Would you take Yaya up front right now?

367~~~
I'd take yaya up front over Rooney even

Fellaini - if he plays I think it will be as a number 10 with Memphis as striker.

368~~~
Would love to see him bundle one in off his elbow from an offside position.

369~~~
With Ashley Young on the left?

370~~~
No, as that would limit Toure's best attributes. Playing Fellaini up there can help bring out the best of his.

371~~~
I know there is a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth but Fellaini will offer more than what Rooney has offered in the PL so far. I am excited about seeing someone upfront that will actually win his duels. I just hope his finishing is on point. Big game for the lad.

372~~~
!!!

373~~~
Word.

Edit: Paragraph!

374~~~
Yeah! Seems the best way to go imo.

375~~~
I wouldn't object to that.

It has the advantage of allowing Martial to sub on for Young if all goes to plan.

376~~~
Big game for him today and I think he'll do well.

377~~~
Has he ever played there before? I mean, from the start, not just going up top at the end of a game.

378~~~
He did for Everton a few times iirc.

I hope I don't jinx him but I think he'll score today.

379~~~
From memory I think he played there quite a bit for Everton. Like half a season maybe.

380~~~
How was he as a striker when he played there for you guys? <a class="username" data-user="48226, @SilentWitness" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48226/">@SilentWitness</a>

381~~~
He played behind the striker mostly. Be prepared for long balls though, which wouldn't be a bad thing with someone like Memphis being able to get on the end of his headers or chest and pass combo.

382~~~
I thought that was as a ten, to be honest.

383~~~
I think he will benefit form having Herrera and Mata around, with Dave back, who will make those long kicks for Fellaini coming little deep chesting the ball to our Spaniards, who will have a bit more space with unformed Liverpool defense to release each other or Memphis/ fullbacks, yes we lack a bit of pace but as you could see Rooney  couldn't utilize that and we will have a quicker transition to the attacking third, only lack Schneiderlin for Carrick in midfield to have a bit more legs and counterattacking quality from midfield but he will be introduced later when one of the two pivots will tire, expecting Martial for closing minutes too..

384~~~
Fellaini is a beast when played upfront and our game plan revolve around long balls and crosses. I would not be surprised if he gets a couple today.

It was a ten. A bit unorthodox number 10 as he would play as a striker most of the time when Everton attacked.

385~~~
Fair point.

386~~~
I have to say the idea of him upfront for United does <i>mildly </i>annoy me. Hopefully it's only because Martial has just joined.

Anyway, it's a derby. Just need a win any way we can get it.

387~~~
I just hope we don't play long ball football all day.

388~~~
Would love him to have a great game today, score and we win. Would really piss the Scousers off.

389~~~
It's all about the system. Any player can be plugged into a role as long as he follows the trainer/coach's instructions. If I tell Fellaini he shall play as the 9, then he shall be the 9.

390~~~
Liverpool are playing a narrow midfield and will be looking to dominate in the middle. There's going to be a chance for Darmian and Shaw to receive the ball on the overlap and get plenty of balls in the box so Fellaini could be a real danger for us today.

391~~~
BE interesting to see if he puts in a performance and a goal today, that Rooney would need to win his place back or not.

392~~~
I'm the same. I'm not massive on Fellaini up top, but as a footballer he's not <i>that </i>bad on the ball, and can be decent enough in possession when he's playing well. We'll undoubtedly hoof it sometimes, but don't want us to just resort to long ball football.

393~~~
Obvious thing to say, but if he has a great game, we'll most likely win. Can be such a nuisance.

394~~~
If Rodgers does not have a gameplan to counter Fellaini aerial strength, he will have a good game. Fellaini ability can easily be nulled if you man mark him with a player of equal strength. Putting Can and/or Sakho on him would nullify his threat.

395~~~
Just read someone in the match day say he isn't a United level striker and even if he scores it doesn't change anything. Mind boggling, the striker is meant to score and if he scores you can't ask for much more.

396~~~
To be fair, scoring <i>one </i>goal is hardly going to change someone's opinion on him. I don't think he's a brilliant option as a striker other than for his physicality and height, but he's certainly a useful option so I'm hoping he has a good game. Part of me wishes we'd thrown Martial into it, though.

397~~~
Serious question, does his afro count for offsides?

398~~~
I think so. He can score with his afro so yes.

399~~~
I think we'll have to sooner or later.

400~~~
What we've seen so far only reaffirms that. Not offering enough up front. He lacks pace, isn't doing a lot with the ball when he has it, has a poor first touch, and isn't even contributing too much in the air. I get that we can't just chuck in Martial, but when you consider how much we paid for the guy, surely he's got to be playing when our main striker isn't in the side?

401~~~
He isn't working, he's being marked out the game and wont make those runs we need him too

402~~~
It's almost like he isn't a striker.

403~~~
he couldn't trap one of the fritzl kids.

404~~~
Van Gaal will be stubborn and keep him on I think. More likely to take Herrera off, drop Fellaini back and put Martial up front.

405~~~
He isn't a striker, plain and simple. The best position for him is the one which he played in at the World Cup for Belgium. He starts in midfield but is given license to make surges into the opponents half depending on the momentum of the game but is expected to track back and press due to his height and physicality. When he's played as purely a striker teams are able to either two man mark/man mark him out of the game and his actual 'striker' ability isn't that good as his finishing and attacking instincts aren't the same due to playing as a DM for most of his career.

406~~~
Not his fault. LVG again screwing around. 

He's never been a striker.

407~~~
His first touch was Liverpool's best defender.

408~~~
Absurd. His ball retention was great. Far better than Benteke's in this match or Rooney's all season. Some people just love to criticise.

409~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

410~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

411~~~
For me, he's doing his best but there's not much going on beyond our full-backs making runs.

412~~~
Agreed. I'd be taking Mata off, and risking Martial up front. Fellaini aloud to drift where he likes when we're attacking.

413~~~
If he was playing in behind a striker it would be grand

But I just don't see how him up top alone is going to work

414~~~
That's hardly a compliment. He was fine with the ball once he had retained it, but his first touch was woeful at times.

415~~~
Last season his best games were in midfield with a license to go forward

416~~~
his biggest strength is plying in the hole really, where he is a bit less predictable than as lone striker where two strikers wait to challenge him everytime he makes run. Also it's quite hard to suddenly change the tactics, when you play such striker up front for the first time.. our biggest strength is rigid midfield and transition to attack..

417~~~
You've got it in one. Fellaini is a decent player and LVG is trying to find a spot for him. United should never have ended up playing him as a starting striker in any game. Blame Moyes

418~~~
Probably our two best 'chances' in the game broke down because the ball literally bounced off him in the 6 yard box. 

I don't care about his ball retention, it's an undeniable fact that is first touch was dreadful.

419~~~
He seems to have no first touch (with his feet). With Fellaini it's simply a matter of how fast the ball is moving when it bounces off him, if it's a fast ball it'll just bounce right off him and away, if he gets lucky and it's a slow ball in, it'll just bounce a short way and he might be able to get it and do something (a short pass) if an opposition player isn't around to get there first....

420~~~
Cant really blame him. He, in his role as the target man, is effective just behind the striker. Pushing him all the way up top means he really is not in the game at all..

421~~~
He's not a striker FFS.

Rather Have Wilson starting there. 

He might bully and score some but rest of his game there is off. LVG having another bad call here.

422~~~
I do not see the point playing him upfront when we do not play long ball or put in more crosses

423~~~
He is not a DM,CM or ST. He can only offer us anything as an AM.

424~~~
The problem is that he's not even really been doing this at all. I was concerned at the start that Fellaini up front would result in us being really one-dimensional and hoofing it up the field too often, but that's not really happening. We're not even particularly getting the aerial threat that he can offer.

425~~~
Can't really blame him for anything his hold up play has been good but without any creativity what so ever behind him he was always going to struggle.

426~~~
What's undeniable is that judging a player's touch based on 2 of his 22 touches is just a teeny bit silly.

427~~~
Tbf that's the most important touch for a striker.

428~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's depressing and funny in equal measures. Rooney (as bad as hes been) gets injured and we are stuck with Fellaini as a fecking striker.

429~~~
It's also the most difficult touch and the kind that Rooney has been messing up on a more frequent basis this season.

430~~~
Here there and nowhere from the big guy and today. I'm glad Louis kept him on as a case of man management because we'll need him going forward.

431~~~
Much better in the 2nd especially when martial came one

432~~~
Not a particularly good game from Fellaini, although I feel it is somewhat mitigated by the fact that we didnt really play to his (or anyones) strengths at all in the first half.

In the second half he improved like most of the team, and did look a lot more comfortable when he was able to drop into space after Martial had come on.

433~~~
Defo not a #9, needs somebody around him and played a lot better with Martial on.

434~~~
Should have played more crosses into him in the first half. Better in the second half, especially when Martial came on.

435~~~
He was poor upfront and his first touch isn't influenced by the position he plays. Got a bit better when he had Martial in-front of him

436~~~
Excatly. He can hold the ball and play it to Martial. Does not work as a CF.

437~~~
Not a striker. Only works if he has someone else beside/infront of him. He's a number 10/8 or a second striker at a stretch.

438~~~
He's not a striker. Did what everyone expected of him. Good hold up, win duels, retain the ball. Standard stuff for him but when up front you have to occupy the two CBs but he was often dropping too deep and being behind the ball.

439~~~
Struggled as #9, his first touch was as shit as Rooney's has been when the ball came into feet most of the time and he hasn't got the mobility to turn a defender or the pace to make runs in behind. Was much better when Martial came on and he went to his more familiar second striker role.

440~~~
Him as a striker, Memphis as the left winger having a stinker and Mata on the right meant we had no threat or pace in behind. Didn't work out. Not a striker to be fair, his best position will always be a as a supporting striker/attacking midfielder hybrid.

441~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

442~~~
I'm curious to know how things would've turned out if Young started instead of Memphis.  You would think Young would've gotten some crosses in, Memphis was really poor.

443~~~
Kindly feck off.  After page-long posts touting the virtues of Fellaini, it's time to throw your hands up and admit you were wrong.  He's not a fecking striker, and he shouldn't be anywhere near our starting XI.  You tried covering yourself by saying we shouldn't be hoofing it up to Fellaini as that's not getting the best out of him.  Do explain to the rest of us how to get the best out of him (as we kept it on the deck today), and why Manchester United need to change our attacking identity to accommodate Maroune fecking Fellaini.  Do you still think Schweinsteiger was a bad buy? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

444~~~
Martial has a great delivery on him but he doesn't get into dangerous crossing positions enough. His first instinct today should have been to get to the bar line. At times, I alsp thought Fellaini took his sweet time getting into the box.

445~~~
Showed his limitations as a striker. Looked better when he dropped deeper though.

446~~~
Did well upfront, better than I thought he would. 

2nd half he was so much more effective when he started dropping deep and Pool had to push defenders forward to keep him from getting the ball and creating space for Martial, Young and Herrera.

His aerial threat means there has to be a big player keeping tabs on him at all times, was much more effective than Rooney has been so far

447~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing a starting eleven with a front four of Martial up front and Memphis, Fellaini, Herrera behind him, from left to right.

448~~~
I never, ever, want to see Fellani playing upfront for Manchester United again. It was horrible, and not even effective. Its also pretty unfair to expect any different from him. He looked like a midfielder trying his best to imitate what a striker should do. Who'd have predicted that eh?

As for that guy trying to argue he's a better striker then Benteke the other night. Give your head a wobble lad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

449~~~
He is an effective no.10 playing behind a striker but not a striker for sure. First touch and movement is absolutely non-existent. He is good ant heading and chesting which he did effectively but that helped us little yesterday. Hope Wilson/Martial get games if Rooney is out but not him as no.9. Wilson should not be sent out on loan.

450~~~
He looked such a lumbering mid-table CF today. Looked like he has no idea on what he was supposed to be doing. Also our service was non-existent over the first half probably didn't help him earn any accolades either. We might as well have crossed more often to test him at the back post though.

451~~~
Not a striker, not a Man Utd level centre forward. Can not blame him for that. Becomes more effective when drops deeper. Makes me wonder whos gonna start as a CF against PSV.

452~~~
Think I've seen him burst into a sprint once in his career....And that was to run the ball out of play against Bayern Munich.

453~~~
It didn't Work with him as a striker, was nice to see our striker able to hold up play and bringing Down balls from the air, but he is too slow to be leading the line.
Better for him to fight for the secondary striker position, right now Herrera's got it though.

454~~~
So many people wanted to see him upfront but hopefully saw that he's just not a striker. Anyways, it's not the last game he will have played upfront this season

455~~~
That run <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

456~~~
Had a poor game but he isn't a striker and lacks the skills to be one so it wasn't really surprising, hopefully we Don't see him there again but given our lack of options it is inevitable he will play there a fair bit.

It's not just the poor touch, lack of movement and pace that caused him to struggle the biggest flaw with playing him as the striker are he is up against centre halves who are big enough and strong enough to deal with him more often than not, it neutralises his best assets and he looked better as soon as hie was dropped deeper yesterday.

457~~~
I see problems for the big guy. He's very much a free ranger and you can't just plug him in any line up. He's never a number 9 unless you going route one exclusively. I'm thinking of last season and he was mega at times at 10 with Herrera playing at CM. Ander's ability to get forward gelled everything especially his link up play with Mata. Fellaini then didn't have to worry about the nitty gritty of 10 play because had Herrera doing that for him. Thats how we get the best out of him and it would be quite a positive attacking line up to boot.

458~~~
He was crap, but it's hardly his fault... he isn't a striker, and I've not really sure why anyone thinks he is. 

I mean, you wouldn't play Frank Lampard up front would you?

459~~~
Not a great game but he's not a number 9 obviously. I was scratching my head at the people on here dismissing concerns about a lack of depth after Rooney because we had Fellaini, it's not a viable option if Rooney is out for a long time. He can play as a number 10 or attacking midfield and do a decent job but a striker he definitely isn't.

460~~~
I liked it when he dropped deeper, but my god was he terrible as a striker.

461~~~
Agreed, the guy is not a striker.

462~~~
He is not a tsriker. Cant be a striker. Should never be played there ever again. 
Even if we have zero forwards, I would still play Memphis or Young or maybe even Herrera/Mata there before playing Fellaini. 
Mata will be dire too, but at least I guess he has more footballing brains than Fellaini.

Again I am not saying Fellaini is useless, but he has limited usefulness and it is not upfront.

463~~~
His only asset as a striker is to keep the ball after he stops it with his chest. His first touch is Rooney-sque, and he lacks any striker instict.

He shouldn't play in that position anymore. Martial, Wilson and Depay should be better choices there.

464~~~
Think there's a bit of an over reaction in here personally and a loss of context.

I'm not advocating it was anything above a 5 rating but just going to add a few elements that seem to have been lost by many:

<ul>
<li>First game. FIRST game.</li>
<li>11/11 passes completed in the final third. None lost or misplaced. None. Cast your minds back to every other game this season.</li>
<li>We didn't actually create many chances for him to thrive on. Memphis, Young, Herrera and Mata are accountable for that too.</li>
<li>He was double marked at set pieces. What do you want him to do in that situation?</li>
<li>He dropped deep to pressure Lucas and take outlet balls from all areas. 7 each received from Shaw and Darmian (none were long balls). That's successful work that is unappreciated. Schweinsteiger was next with 5 and Carrick with 3. Memphis, Mata, Young and Herrera all had less than 2. Everyone is accountable for that, not just Fellaini.</li>
<li>He created a chance.</li>
<li>He also won the ball back 6 times. A catalyst for our possession and a driver for such dominance and pinning Liverpool in in the first half with Schweini, Carrick, Shaw and Darmian.</li>
</ul>I'm looking forward to PSV and him up front again and hoping to see more improvement.

465~~~
If he starts up-front I'd probably rather he play a 'false 9' kind of role rather than lead the line. If he can occupy the two centre-halves and drag them deeper it should open up space for Herrera or even Mata.

466~~~
well said. I'm not a fan of his upfront, but too many posters on the caf are ignoring what he did well

467~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

10/10, would read again.

468~~~
I wholly agree with this.

We could argue night and day about "Manchester United class strikers" but Fellaini contributed more than a certain Manchester United striker has. Completed his passes, got a few possessions back for us,. I thought he did decently, for someone out of position.

469~~~
Yeah, but they're slippery little bastards.

470~~~
Was absolutely useless tonight. He wasn't the only one of course, but he contributed nothing. We would've been better served keeping the ball to feet.

471~~~
He looked weak to me. He has been ill apparently.

472~~~
Frustrating as he took a few balls into him down, or looked to have done at least, then clumsily have it away or wasted the pass. 

I'm actually not that bothered about using him like this as it can and does work when there simply isn't enough time for the passing game. 

Woeful tonight though.

473~~~
He's a savant isn't he. You just can't throw him in any situation.

474~~~
So many wanted him to play more but in games like this he just doesn't do enough. Yes, we were poor as a team but we got worse once he was on.

475~~~
One thing that annoys me. Two games in a row from him the ball comes to him inside the box and he either isn't ready and loses it past him or it bounces off of him. He's just very ent-like. Not a person you want inside the box when the ball is traveling below the chest.

476~~~
Pretty obvious he was going to come on. It's the only plan from the bench when we are chasing a game. He was poor but the service to him was pretty shit. Can't really argue with him coming on as it's worked in the past. The problem is our lack of front options from the bench that can come on and bail us out when we're in need of a goal. Over the years, we had those options in abundance.

477~~~
Sorry but he's not good enough.

We need a real plan B, and he ain't it.

478~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Agreed with your point, he just seems a bit slow to react in the box.

479~~~
That one moment where he sets up Mata on his left foot on the edge of the box. And Mata crazily passes it back to him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I dont blame him tbh. He gets brought on into a 2 man CM. Then gets pushed up and I cant remember one cross being sent to him to attack. Everything was a long ball / hoof which resulted in him having his back to their goal on the edge of the box for him to flick on or chest down.

480~~~
I don't blame him. I don't understand why the rest of the team turns to shite and tries to hoof it to him. He's pretty good with the ball at his feet as well.

481~~~
He has been ill, so tonight he wasn't at his best.

Was poor though.

482~~~
His reactions when the ball drops in the box seem to vary from first touch of a rapist to being filmed by John Woo. I don't get when we bring him on why we don't loft in more angel passes, he's a nightmare aerially as you can be 6'2 and still need to jump like Jordan to get level with him once he attacks a cross.,

483~~~
He was useless and  that combined with our decision to just lump everything forward once he came on effectively ended the game.

484~~~
Because that's clearly what they are told to do once he comes on. 

Fwiw, I thought we were half arsed with him tonight. Played him deeper than I would have liked. Stick him right up there on one FB and play balls to him.

485~~~
He seemed so lethargic in his manner. He was played 2-3 really good passes. He should have done more. No excuses.

486~~~
Fellaini and football don't correlate, if we want to have a plan B with a target man, then a proper target man who's good with his feet will do, not this garbage that we see with Fellaini.

487~~~
Sad (because we paid 27m for this) but true.

488~~~
I almost want us to start him in games, so he doesn't have to come into them and disrupt our flow so heavily.

Bringing Fellaini on seemingly only really works if a) We're already winning or b) It's early enough (say stroke of half-time) that everyone dosen't immediately resort to hoof ball.

489~~~
Over the last 2 matches we haven't played to his strengths, not many high balls played to him which was strange to say the least. Lets hope he can pick up on his form last year.

490~~~
I don't even know why we aim for his head, he's not even <i>THAT</i> good in the air/at knocking the ball down... especially not from a standing start. 

Aim for the fecker's chest... thats where the money is.

491~~~
He was really bad tonight. He's got his qualities, but none of them were seen here tonight.

492~~~
We don't need him, not a ST, #10, CM or DM.
Get rid.

493~~~
Probably our best player in the first half to be fair but alright <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

494~~~
I missed the first half.

Certainly didn't have a great second half. Nothing came off for him.

495~~~
I'm struggling to see where he really fits into things. I like the big man, but I'm starting to think he's on borrowed time.

496~~~
It's likely his final season. I think the team will have outgrown him by the end, but he'll keep doing a job in various positions. When he finds his form again he'll come handy.

497~~~
He was awful tonight and I like him. He just didn't look like he belonged on the pitch.

498~~~
If we are going to play the long ball to Fellaini, we really need a second player close to him to receive the ball from him. This match, he won plenty of headers but was completely isolated.

499~~~
He wasn't great, but he wasn't as bad as some people are making out. 

I don't think he's a actual number 10. I liked it when he played as a 8/10 in a 433 - similar to where he plays for Belgium.

500~~~
Thats by far his best position. When he get get into the box from midfield, not the way we use him now.

501~~~
He was very poor and it's going to be tough for him to get back into the starting eleven, which is a good thing because we should have better options up front and in midfield. 

He offers something different and will play a role over the course of the season but the team has moved on and that red card at the end of last season has been costly, he is well down the pecking order now.

502~~~
2nd touch was always a tackle. Still hope we keep him.

503~~~
He's not a #9 or a #10, his best football for us came in the formation we used last season, both him and Herrera have struggled with the change IMO.

504~~~
Hasn't been good this season to be honest. Scored v Brugge but that's it.

505~~~
Thought he was okay in the 1st half and went off the boil in the 2nd.  Looking a bit excess to needs ATM.

506~~~
He's the final player LVG needs to get rid of. The man has done some good things recently but he just doesn't fit into this team if we're to be honest with ourselves.

507~~~
We've undone all of the good work which made him shake off the stereotypical caveman responses about hoofball and plan b with how we've been using him this season. Disappointing really.

508~~~
I don't get this post. Hoofball legitimately describes how we brought the best out of him last season. You can't blame 'how he's being used' on how poor he looks on the ball even with the basics. His first touch is atrocious for example

509~~~
Well you wouldn't, if you in fact believe;
Because that is not how we used him at all in the starting lineup last season, especially his starts at 6 and 8 as well as his extended spell at wide 10. I don't think he played one single full game up front where we used hoofing it to him as a legitimate strategy. There were a few times where he came on late while we chased the game last season but to relatively poor effect, but mainly off the bench at half time he was brought on as another peice in the general puzzle without the need to resort to hoofing it to him as a strategy.

We've brought him on twice this season with a view to doing that as well as starting him at striker in which we did that exclusively. It's not the way to play him and he does not work well in a hoofball system as a striker. We've undone all of the good work of last year by placing him back into a low percentage role which doesn't suit him as a player.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/acjt" width="560"></iframe>

Indeed, dreadful.

510~~~
To me we won't see the best out of Fellaini just like we won't see the best out of Herrera unless we revert to that 4-1-4-1 we've played last season with double #8s. And to be fair I don't have a hard on for that 4141 because I'd say that Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger are doing just as good job as Carrick/Herrera/Fellaini did last season. Not in terms of goals obviously but in terms of creating and controlling the game. It's the attackers that simply need to take the scoring stuff on themselves and kick off finally. (that probably means that Rooney needs to stop playing like a pleb and Depay has to pick it up)

Both Fellaini and Herrera have been mediocre this season, playing either double pivot, #10 or Fellaini with his #9.

511~~~
Yeah, unless BFS and Carrick get injured (fecking hope not) we probably won't be going back to 4-3-3 which is a huge blow for Fellaini.

512~~~
Poor yesterday, not even able to hold up the ball and lay it off when we played a long ball up to him. Ipswich always had a man sticking close to him and nullified him pretty easily. A far cry from last season where I remember only Zouma getting the better of him aerially.

513~~~
I'm running out words to describe how bad Fellaini is. The fecker couldn't even be trusted to complete a 3 yard pass. Rooney was on the move, and if only the ball managed to reach him, we'd of been through for a counter. But no, the useless sack of shite had to ruin it with a display of the most garbage passing ability. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>
Dont why we waste our time with him tbf. Whatever minutes Fellaini's got this season, could have been used to develop Wilson, Pereira or our other upcoming youngsters.

514~~~
I've watched that video three times now and can't figure out what you're getting at.  How is this proof of anything?

515~~~
You know it's all gone to shit for Fellaini when even <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> won't poke his oblong head in here to defend him.

516~~~
Wow, on that video evidence the Lads WC, we need more Fellainis.

517~~~
Dunno about world class, but that first touch looked fine to me.

518~~~
He was merely dispelling the lazy argument that his first touch is shit?

519~~~
May I remind you of this?

520~~~
Nothing wrong with having Fellaini on the bench for the rest of the season. There'll be certain situations or games where a big presence is needed & he fits the bill perfectly. We've already seen that he can score goals & we probably could have done with bringing him on for the last 10/15 minutes against Southampton at the weekend when we were under the kosh.

We're allowed to have 7 subs. We'd be mad not to have as many different options as possible.

521~~~
So we just shut the gate, the guy is shit? I am all for discussing a player properly, but there are certain myths that just aren't true. Like how he's a plan b hoofball expert, he's much better when deployed as a proper footballer at wide 10. Frankly he's been awful almost every time we've played hoofball with him.

Even his Brugges goal was a layoff and rush into the box. That doesn't mean that is the only way to use him and he suddenly becomes a crap footballer.

I'm with the above as well who posted that there is no room for him at the moment in this seasons 4-2-3-1 unless there are injuries at 10 and 8.

522~~~
With one video of an incredibly routine first touch that you'd expect any professional footballer to make?

523~~~
Well from reading comments here you'd think that every time he touches the ball it lands on the Moon so yeah?

524~~~
I can cap the other 13/14 routine first touches if you like? His first touch is pretty standard, like the majority of our team.

525~~~
I'd be perfectly fine with this, as it would mean that standards have improved to where his services aren't necessary unlike last season.  If Fellaini is getting many minutes, that means something isn't going right.  I'm sure he'll get his opportunities in the odd cup game and maybe as a Plan C in certain situations.

526~~~
I think he is a more than capable footballer when we aren't resorting to hoofball, fair enough if you're willing to write him off. I think it is a bit harsh.

527~~~
He's always been a low level to mid level player. People defend him because he's willing to work hard but today the fecker couldn't even be bothered to put in a shift. Lumbering around in midfield, cant be bothered to run. Breaking up our own attacks with his piss poor touches and abysmal passing.

If we don't have anyone else I don't mind him on the team sheet. But we have bright young talents like Wilson and Pereira in the squad. Why give Fellaini chances ahead of them?. Its not as if he's in top form. The minutes given to him could've been valuable first team time for the kids.

We cant afford passengers in our campaign, and anything other than top form, he is a passenger and a liability.

528~~~
You're literally seeing what you want to see.

529~~~
He put in a fair few shifts last season and a couple that won us points. I think he's a lot better footballer than he is being given credit for here with these arguments. He's not Michael Ballack but he's not completely shit.

530~~~
He was instrumental in our best run of form in the whole of last season, in which he did a lot more than just win headers and show off his chest control. He's clearly a decent footballer on his day. He's had a slow start to this season but - as usual - people are being far too hasty to completely write off a player after a handful of mediocre performances.

531~~~
Exactly, he's not a brilliant footballer that we drop everything and build around but he is definitely a lot better than what some of these arguments being presented make out. Some as though he can barely play at all.

532~~~
He can put in good performances when he's in top form, but that is very rare. At the moment he's in piss poor form. So I think the kids should get the nod ahead of him.

His skills on the ball are absolutely mediocre mate.

533~~~
I think the stick Fellaini gets is a little unfair. He hasn't played well this season but he was banned for the first few games so has no match sharpness, he is played here there and everywhere and hasn't had a run in the team. He hasn't suddenly become completely useless over night. People cant just disregard how good he was in an attacking midfield role for us last season along side Herrera . If he is played in a 4-3-3 with 1 DM behind and a 2 box to box/attacking midfielders, him being one of them then he is a good player. Anywhere else hes not so good and looks a bit lost at times.

534~~~
People mocked his attempt to run through the defense but he won it back, passed it to Bastian and the rest is history. Didn't have a pre season and I think we've also kinda shifted his position. He's going to be raw at times, but a valuable member of the squad. Scored an important goal in Champions League qualifier of course but some people think you need world class through out the squad. Bullshit.

535~~~
What kids though? Perreira and Lingard? Obviously I don't want him playing striker I think he's completely pointless as a striker so that argument is moot. But mediocre, maybe but I still think is harsh.

536~~~
I already mention which kids in my previous posts. Yes, Wilson, Pereira, Lingard, or Goss, or our other upcoming talents. They need games. And giving minutes to Fellaini when he's not in top form is absolutely pointless.

537~~~
I saw his performances against PSV, Swansea, and tonight. Have I missed something? Has he been brilliant in any of those?

538~~~
No, and he wasn't full of 'piss poor touches' and 'abysmal passing' like you're suggesting either. You know that you don't have to go into extremes, right? There's a field inbetween those two called 'average' that perfectly describes him and most of our players in those games.

539~~~
He will be our plan B and that's about it. 5th choice midfielder, 3rd or 4th choice no.10, 3rd or 4th choice striker under our current system. The less he play the better football we play. Yet we don't always play good football so getting him on as sub when things not working could be a good option to make.

540~~~
Or they've seen Fellaini at his best, and realize now we simply have better options.  Also to get the best out of him, requires us to play in a way most United fans would rather not see.

541~~~
If a player cant even pass a ball to other player who's less than 5 yards from him, is that not piss poor by any standard? Am I supposed to call that average?

542~~~
Who doesn't want to see 4-3-3? That run of games last season is always referenced to how well we are doing as a unit and he was playing that 10 role really effectively. Also what better options do we have at 10? Rooney, Depay, Januzaj (on loan) and Mata have all been various types of poor there. Perreira has had one game on the left against a championship outfit.

I think the 10 is still very much up for grabs. 4-2-3-1 suits Rooney/Mata, 4-3-3 suits Fellaini but that requires the midfield reshuffle that not many will want to see. Effectively if we are without BFS and Carrick for any extended period of time is really the only way we'll go back to a system that suits Fellani where we can set him up on the left holding up play and running into the box late in the move.

543~~~
Please name all the times when he couldn't complete a 5 yard pass. Against PSV and Swansea that you mentioned he played around 28 minutes combined.

544~~~
I'm one of the people who's adamant about switching back to 4-3-3 from last season. IMO that's the only system to use to get something out of Fellaini. In other system he's just a hindrance.

545~~~
Well I'd struggle to think of any game under Van Gaal I've enjoyed watching more than the wins over Spurs and City last season. Can you? Fellaini played in both those games.

546~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96602, @United again!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96602/">@United again!</a> Do you seriously think that the linkup play between Martial and Fellaini will be better than with any of Rooney, Mata, Herrera, or Memphis as our 10? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

547~~~
How about last night? There were several occasions where Rooney was less than 5 yards away from him (at least to me), then Fellaini passed the ball so weakly it didn't even reach him. That was beyond embarrassing. Our counter attacks broke down because of him. I'm sorry but I cant excuse something as piss poor as that.

548~~~
I mean, seriously, name them, minutes, whatever, there's sadly no statistics centre for COC so I can't even check it. You're throwing a shitload of cliches like 'he can't pass' and other shit without being able to back it up anyhow. And no, 'to me' or 'just watch the game' doesn't really do you any justice.

549~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-24-2015/_EGLZ9.gif" src="http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-24-2015/_EGLZ9.gif"/> 

Not a bad first touch.

550~~~
Well, if you weren't being observant enough that's not my fault is it? I dont need to throw a load of shit to say Fellaini is in piss poor form.

You want to see it? Just rewatch the match easy.

551~~~
Oh, so it's me not being observant enough and not you with an agenda or seeing things how you want it, how convenient.

You're throwing load of shit already by the way, it's called bullshit though.

552~~~
How about you accusing me having an agenda? Now that's convenient. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Refuse to admit you're ignorant eh? 

Yeah, there's a load of shite around here, most of them came from you mate. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

553~~~
No, not really, it's not me coming to player's thread throwing load of cliches and bollocks without ability to back it up anyhow other than 'go watch the match'.

554~~~
The evidence is in the game itself. If you want to see it, then go and rewatch it. Why are you having a go at me just because you missed moments in the game where your favourite player messed up?

555~~~
Well, our current run since Martial joined (PSV withstanding) ain't so bad.  Obviously not the same caliber of opponents, so it'd hardly bring the same joy that bigger wins would.  That 4-5 game run last season starting with Tottenham at home was amazing.  And tbf, Fellaini played his role very well.  But, I do believe part of the reason for the fans' euphoria was putting up with watching almost two years of turgid shit football.

556~~~
Some of the Fellaini criticism reminds me of a spoiled rotten kid throwing a fit and calling a Christmas gift crap.  No, he's not that precious Red Rider BB gun, but he'll do just fine in the squad.

For the life of me, I can't figure why it's such a big deal.  When he hits good form, he'll be in the team.  When it is best to play him (rotation, opponent, injuries, whatever) he'll play.  LvG has options he just didn't last year, and the holdovers have another year of the system under their belt.  We probably won't see hoofball like that again.

You will see him being a sticking point for 20+ yard passes, which is great now that United can field a team of players with a wide passing range.  Blind's ball to Rooney v Ipswich comes to mind.  It keeps the defense honest and creates space for the system to work.  I won't be critical for stretches like last year, but there will be times when he comes on and does a job--maybe improves the team.

Fellaini and his periodic use is not going to drag United from its vaunted position to a low brow team.  If we don't see more of last season's purple patch this year, maybe we can earnestly say the "attack, attack, attack" days are under threat--maybe the identity itself.

It's just a bit historic for me to treat Fellaini as the harbinger of doomsday boredome or to say he's a poor footballer.  What he did at Everton alone makes that argument specious.

He's a squad player, and we are going to be fine.

<b>Edit:</b>  I would hate to see United end up like Arsenal: a team of nearly identical, spineless technicians.  Fellaini adds some grit and another skill set without being a totally blunt, one dimensional weapon like Andy Carroll.

557~~~
Some absolute nonsense being spoken in here! Mainly by one poster in particular. No doubt Fellaini has struggled a bit so far this season but that's down to a variety of factors, and not being a good footballer is not one of them. He showed last season that he can play. The stuff that gets spouted about his passing and touch is just because he's over 6ft 4in and looks gangly. Obviously I am not saying he is Messi, but you do not play top flight football for seven years if you cannot control the ball. He is a decent player.

The shift in formation has clearly hampered him (and Herrera). So he is still adjusting to that, while missing the first three matches of the league this season. He was also ill before the PSV match so who knows if there are any after effects of that. Also, I think Van Gaal has hurt him by primarily using him for 'hoofball' this season. He's a batter player than that, and to be honest he seems more effective when we don't do that. Finally, when he was playing well last season it was definitely not a case of 'hoofball' - it was good attacking football which he was crucial too.

558~~~
Lets be honest with ourselves: he'll be off in the Summer, which will spell the end for the last of the sub-par players that Van Gaal inherited. Can he be useful? Of course he can. However more often than not you have a player who just isn't talented enough to consistently contribute at the top level. If they haven't already, the likes of Januzaj/Pereira will have shown enough for our "plan B" not to be lumping it up to the big man. And if they haven't, then that'll be Van Gaal's next transfer target.

The fact that even as recently as this week he still believes his best position is in the centre of midfield is probably damning in itself; given that his abilities in front of goal (scoring headers and bringing the ball down in the final third) are the biggest qualities he's shown in the Premier League for Everton (12/13) and United (14/15). I certainly couldn't name the qualities that he possesses that make him suited to a box-to-box or holding midfield role.

559~~~
He's been a passenger bar the Brugges game where he scored. He's the last piece of deadwood LVG needs to get rid of. He's struggling to fit into the system at present. He's not a starter. I'd rather give minutes to Lingard and Perierra.

560~~~
I don't always agree with you <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>, but I am with you on this on. Also agree with remarks made by <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a>. These blithely disparaging and wildly over the top judgements might say more about the poster than they do about the player.

561~~~
Agenda driven posters in the Fellaini thread? Good grief! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

562~~~
Was tidy and worked hard enough but offered nothing to the attack.

563~~~
He's fine as a plan b but I do wish he wasn't our only plan b. We had very few options when we needed to get back in the game. Fellaini would have needed to be absolutely outstanding to make any real difference today.

564~~~
He was fine when he came on. Mostly kept the ball, didn't pussy out of things or make crap decisions.

565~~~
Did well.

566~~~
would have rather had him playing in le arse's baox looking for knock downs etc. not played further from goal. not his fault

567~~~
Did well when he come on today, and these are the type of games he should be starting. He played a lot deeper than I thought when he come on, but he give us the grit and strength we were missing in the first half. Sure, he may have made a few fouls, but that's what we needed - someone who disrupted Arsenal's flow.

568~~~
He did alright but it's difficult to judge, Arsenal were playing at 50% in the second half and we were always going to get a lot of the ball. He showed some good signs though.

569~~~
Don't know why he came on today as we didn't utilize him correctly, he was out wide, in midfield but not in the box.

570~~~
Did more in his short cameo than Rooney did all match. At least he can receive the ball without giving it away and starting a counter. His passing was tidy as well, even made a couple of dribbles. Slightly underrated as an actual footballer.

571~~~
If he ready to shoot from distance I would rather play him over Rooney.

572~~~
One game where I was hoping that we would bring him in and then hoof it to him to put Arsenal's soft defense under pressure.....and he plays in the midfield. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

I don't think we can read too much into his midfield performance as at that point Arsenal were happy to sit back and watch us pass it around slowly without ever threatening much.

573~~~
Would be nice if he learnt how to tackle instead of fouling all the time

574~~~
Yet Carrick was still terrible in the second half. Point being that Fellaini deserves credit for playing well rather than "meh.. the opposition went easy"

575~~~
We would have been better starting him, we were improved with him on the pitch.

576~~~
Stats:
35/37 passes
94.6% completion
7 ball recoveries
1 chance created
0 shots
1 tackle

Need to account for the context in which he performed, essentially a lost match after 45 minutes and a testimonial pace, but that still represents good stats.

577~~~
He's a fighter. I like him.

578~~~
Those are still good stats in the context of the half

I'm not his biggest fan but he did very little wrong in that half and offered us a presence further up the pitch and that seemed to give us more composure overall.

579~~~
Him, Herera and Bastian should be the type of midfield we use for these tough away matches.

Get in their face, disrupt the flow of their game, frustrate them. The way Arsenal just waltzed through our midfield in the first half, especially the first 15 min, was shameful

580~~~
He's better then Rooney thesedays.

581~~~
I like that he gave it his all even with his starting spot gone this season. Hope that attitude rubs off to some of our other players, that fight I quite appreciate.

582~~~
He played decent and it shows that he's more than a capable <span style="text-decoration: underline">central</span> midfielder but his good showing in the 2nd half shouldn't actually tell us 'oh he can do a job in midfield', it's the other obvious one, WE FECKING NEED TO PLAY A PROPER 3 MAN MIDFIELD ffs. Rooney can feck off to the wing because we know he's not getting dropped.

583~~~
I just look back at when he tore arsenal a new one last year, and wonder why we aren't using him the same way this time in the same formation. Then I remember,its because Rooney has to play

584~~~
He was pretty tidy I thought. Obviously context of the match must be taken into account but still, he was decent. A shame he couldn't really get forward and cause any concern for the Arsenal defence.

585~~~
also schneiderlin. baffled why we didn't start him and go with a slow CM pairing in carrick-schweini, was asking for trouble with that starting lineup.

thought fellaini did okay today, especially given how poor most of the starting xi has been.

586~~~

587~~~
I love Fellaini, never makes problems and is happy to be here. Sure he is just a squad player, but i think we used him well last season, this year not so much.

588~~~
Me too. If it was up to me, I'd still be playing the midfield three we played at the back end of last season, with Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini. Had a good blend of everything, and we produced some really good football.

589~~~
I am a huge fan of him and also believe he is more or less a squad player but I feel like people don't see how important the "squad player" role is at a club like Man United. He (and all good squad players) adds to us that extra layer of depth for having a successful season.

590~~~
Looked sprightly getting down that right wing! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

591~~~
Got a good reception. I thought Everton hates anyone that tries to leave.

592~~~
He hardly left on bad terms. And they got a massive fee.

593~~~
They obviously appreciate what he did for them. 

Anyway, thought he did well in the little time he was on. Went on a few Martial runs. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

594~~~
Wins the ball back so much through simply scaring the opposition from bothering to meet him in a 50/50.

595~~~
His chest control is the best I've ever seen in the sport. It's almost like Berbas first touch.

596~~~
I've just noticed how terrifying he looks in his photo next to his profile at the top of the page. That would make any player shit a brick or two.

597~~~
He's certainly one of a kind.

598~~~
He didn't really do much or have a particularly good game but just fact he was something different for them to deal with helped change the game.

599~~~
I don't understand how he does it. Whenever I try to chest a ball that's pinged at me, it goes bouncing off miles away. It just drops perfectly to his feet when he does it.

600~~~
Pointless. 

Why he was subbed on ahead of Mata is baffling

601~~~
He did well.

602~~~
He was just brilliant when he came on. Just what we needed in that game.

603~~~
He did absolutely nothing tonight. And it's not even down to him,we just acted like he isn't even there. The praise is ridiculous.

604~~~
Didn't offer much in attack but I thought he did his defensive work well.

605~~~
So his performance ranged somewhere between brilliant and pointless? Classic Fellaini.

606~~~
He won back the ball plenty of times deep and in their half and got us moving forward.

Compared to Schweinsteiger who constantly passed slowly backwards or 5 yards to the side.

607~~~
He did well when he came on I was pleasantly surprised.

608~~~
Offered us a platform to build from in midfield with his physicality (albeit an inconsistent platform) but worked sufficiently to get us back into the game.

609~~~
I love Mata but that was not the game for him. 

We were getting nothing trying to pass it around and break them down. 

Fellaini disrupts and attracts players away from the others.

610~~~
He did the job that he was brought on for.

611~~~
Did well enough I thought. Won the ball back several times and got forward into good attacking areas, gave CSKA a problem. If we had bothered to use our free kicks later on to actually try to score a goal, rather than either a) passing back to the CBs or b) hitting it out for a goal kick - Fellaini may have been more threatening*.

*While on that topic, it seems a common theme this season that when we are chasing a game in the dying embers, rather than playing the ball into the box we play stupid short FKs and corners, even if we have Fellaini on the field. Its utterly bizarre.

612~~~
I thought he was decent. He was a little sloppy at times but he hasn't been playing much so that could explain why. He did move the ball around well too and won it back. It is frustrating how we never seem to be able to get the ball near him when he is in the box though.

613~~~
Him and Hererr as a pair of AMs was a feature of all our best football last season. He was rusty tonight but his arrival and the change in formation made a massive, positive difference.

614~~~
He is a quality player and at this stage we are better when he's playing.

615~~~
Yeah, but I still wish he stuck his foot forward when that dangerous ball in front of goal was close to him and regardless of Akinfeev's proximity. In a 50/50, it would be hard to blame him if he hit the CSKA goalkeeper while attempting to get to the ball.

616~~~
He was far from pointless, he was a big part of the improved second half performance.

617~~~
yeah I think the formation wth one pivot and two "b2bs" was the best we played last year. Some excellent games against Spurs, Liverpool and City after Arsenal knocked us out of the FA cup..

Fella did well in the same position tonight, provided option to pass, more directly.. chest down all arerial balls/half clearances. All in all decent cameo for the Belgian, with a little bit of luck and better delivery he could score, certainly an option for the city game. I don't htink he will start though..

618~~~
They are so opposite that they balance each other well. The opposition has to set to defend not only for Herrera's ability in tight spaces and eye for a pass, but for Fellaini's physicality and aerial threat. I know LVG has been going with the 4-2-3-1 but I definitely think we should revert back to the 4-3-3 at times. As you said, our best football last season came from that formation.

619~~~
Did okay, but when he took the ball down in their box with his chest and just played it backwards and we went back to the CBs, in our half, within 3 or 4 seconds it led me to briefly contemplate the nature of existence and I don't like doing that during football. 

Does show how a 4-3-3 is at times our best formation and we need to be able to play it and 4-2-3-1. I think being able to do both is compatible with Mata's versatility, as well.

If we sell Rooney this summer, a fine 4-3-3 would just be 2 signings away:

----------Martial-------- (Wilson)
Memphis------------RW (Mata, Januzaj, Pereira)
------CM------Herrera-- (Mata, Schwein, Fellaini)
--------Schneiderlin---- (Schwein, Carrick)

And when we play 4-2-3-1, it's just one of Herrera or Mata as the 10 and the other on the bench.

620~~~
It was also simultaneously brilliant and pointless. 

Best exemplified, as I mentioned in the post above, by the incredible moment when he took the ball down in the box on his chest in his inimitable manner and then got scared or had no creative ideas and so just popped it backwards to a player who was only in a position to keep going backwards.

621~~~
I was happy to see that for once his substitution did not lead to us endlessly pinging the ball to him and stop playing football. He showed a good all around game today, used his aerial threat but also defended well and passed reasonably. Still not showing enough to earn more than cameos, mind. Don't know how much more there is to his United career at this rate.

622~~~
This.

623~~~
Did exactly what he was supposed to do once he came on.

Shouldn't be near the starting XI, but fair play to him for doing his job well today.

624~~~
Wish he came on earlier. Particularly when we were pinning them back deep early in the second half. He could have given us that link play for an opening instead of Rooney constantly killing moves.

625~~~
His last few sub appearances have been encouraging I think.

626~~~
Pushing for a start.

627~~~
Yeah, I think he's put himself in contention and is almost certain to start on Wednesday.

628~~~
Try Schneiderlin and Herrera-Fellaini as b2bs ahead of him like last year only Morgan on for Carrick. It will work IMO. We need sth different, and somehow bypass Rooney by putting a big man there...

629~~~
He did more than just the usual "Fellaini thing". He retained possession well, and moved the ball on more quickly and sharply than most. Good cameo.

630~~~
He's Rooney with a wig

631~~~
Shoots like a girl, no power or direction.

632~~~
Been our best player tonight in fairness

633~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

634~~~
His end product has been awful, sure, but he's been great in everything else. Moves very well and constantly asks for the ball.

635~~~
I find him quite likeable these days, seems to care and works hard, but he repeatedly gets himself into positions where his lack of quality is exposed.

Not sure he has the skill set to be anything more than a bit part player here.

636~~~
I think he's probably been our best player but every time he gets the ball at his feet in the final third I know nothing will come of it.

637~~~
I feel fairness needs to be defined here...Out of cutting my cock or thumb off, i'd prefer my thumb to be cut off, that doesn't mean it's mint to have the thumb cut off...

638~~~
<i>Best </i>is probably not the correct word. He's been the most consistent player but nothing has really come off him which is a usual performance from him.

639~~~
That chest control.

640~~~
Does Fellaini actually jump for headers? Doesn't feel like it. He just takes position and if the ball doesn't come to where he is the defender will get it. That Blind cross right now, 117th minuted or so. Straight at him but he expected to chest it down and Ayala just cleared it without a challenge. Pretty annoying to watch when our football is geared a lot toward him when he's on.

641~~~
Hopefully he never plays another minute for us in any capacity again.

642~~~
Are you joking? He was easily one of our best players tonight. But of course it's Fellaini so he'll just get fecking destroyed by everyone as usual

643~~~
One of the more effective players on the night.

644~~~
He did ok I thought. One of the few who kept going

Should have buried that header at the end

645~~~
This performance will split opinion and then some.

Lots of good moments, lots of appalling ones. He wasn't very good at all, to be honest. He's a much better player than that.

646~~~
Comfortably our best player - was driving us all night.

647~~~
No i'm not, I'm not really concerned about his individual performance as it was decent today. I'm more concerned with the issue that our football suffers so much when he is on the pitch, creativity is lost and its constant garbage balls into his path (which he isn't great at dealing with to be honest). Also, he takes ages to make decisions when he has the ball at his feet, a few times today he stifled our counter attacks by taking ages to play the ball out his feet. 

I'm not concerned with him playing 'his best' when we are playing overall shit football, that really doesn't mean much. When he's on the field the team lacks, accompany that with Rooney and feck me its horrendous.

648~~~
Yes he did do okay tonight, but as I said earlier, him playing 'okay' during an appalling team performance doesn't really account to anything. He looks okay in a shit set up, that cant be accepted at Manchester United.

649~~~
He was ok I thought, not particularly threatening or creative but he at least got about the pitch and could hold onto the ball when pressured.

650~~~
His pass to Rooney on that counter attack was a joke, too.

He should have played Martial in over the top in extra time yet dallied around with it. 

Both noticeable moments of shite play that frustrated me.

651~~~
Why do we treat him like he's fecking Messi? The idea behind him being useful is that we mix it up and not be one dimensional but when he's on the pitch he becomes the sole player we go to! Players that are great with the ball at their feet like Pereira just punting the ball at him and overhitting crosses, so tedious.

652~~~
He did ok. He had some good moments, and some bad moments which kinda resulted in being ok.

653~~~
He did decently today. 

I actually think he was a good player to have for this kind of game.

654~~~
he did decently I actually think the same while everyone should probably ask how in the hell he didn't score 9 goals? I can tolerate those three missed headers but how in the hell can Manchester United player hit a ball like he's 13year old after getting drunk for the first time wth a patch over his eyes. that is disgraceful and his horrible finishing cost us a game too

655~~~
No end product at all can't shoot or make a pass in the final third, even his heading is over rated. He's a good impact sub  though and should be kept around for that.

656~~~
Not as effective as the end of last season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

657~~~
I was really frustrated by Fellaini during last night's performance. I can't fault him for effort, but our whole game plan seems to go to pot when he's on the field.

A few things happen with Fellaini on the field. A) We play it long trying to pick him out. B) When we try to counter with pace he picks up the ball and fails to move it on quickly. This happened a couple of times yesterday and we would have been in if he had found the right ball quick enough. C) Every cross/corner is played far too deep in the hope that he can head it back across goal.

Our whole game plan changes when he's around, and it doesn't change for the better.

658~~~
You lot surely can't be surprised that in terms of footballing, technical and passing ability, Fellaini isn't good enough for a team trying to win things? Surely?

He's a plan B, he'll hinder our game if we try to play football at a high level along the ground, but it isn't like he was anywhere near the biggest culprit yesterday. 

He shouldn't be a starter for a team trying to win things as even Van Gaal has realized.

659~~~
Thought he was excellent last night, and I'm far from his biggest fan. That's the most 'football' I've seen him play in a United shirt ever. He was bullying opponents, winning arial balls as he doesn, but he was also spinning and turning away from players and driving the team forward centrally. Never knew he had it in him.

660~~~
x100

661~~~
He was one of our better players. Total commitment to the cause and drove us on all game. When he was moved up top he was far more effective than Rooney. Fellaini is absolutely not the problem, since we don't rely on him as a regular starter these days anyway.

662~~~
Bring him on.

663~~~
I feel like he could so something in this game. Although hopefully he would bring his finishing boots with him.

664~~~
He's awful in the air. He is only perceived to be good thanks to his height.

665~~~
True. He does not jump that high, but just positions himself well and uses his physicality to win the duels.

666~~~
Didn't really affect the game one way or another when he came on, I think constantly hitting it high to him makes us to predictable, he's not incapable of passing it on the floor but we seem to go into autopilot when he comes on.

667~~~
Is it me or has he already peaked for us? I feel like he is becoming less and less useful each passing game this season.

668~~~
Is he good at anything besides 'Chesting'? He is completely useless when it's not total hoofball. And then when we do hoof if, we do not have enough players around him to take advantage. Weird. 

It's like, okay, we are shit, there is no game changer on the bench, you go Chester, do your thing and may be we'll get lucky.

669~~~
He's actually fine with the ball at his feet despite what I'm reading here. He's just not a top quality midfielder. Midfielder - he's not a striker or a no.10. He's a midfielder with a different set of attributes. 

He's still better on the ball than our captain, which isn't much brag about but he's not the biggest problem we have right now.

670~~~
Yep. Losing out to Gayle in the air was ridiculous. He's very easily marked in the air. If you put someone on him then he never does a thing. We did it with Jones in Fergie's last season and Jose with Zouma at the Bridge last season. Others have done the same effectively. Also during Moyes' tenure he was awful in the air most of the time.

671~~~
i'd say so, nothing against the guy but my heart sinks at the sight of him coming on. Even more than the long ball tactic my biggest annoyance of him is he cannot make a challenge without fouling or giving a freekick away. Just a clumsy brawler

672~~~
Why do people get so depressed when he comes on? Sure, we are a little more direct at times, but it is better than constant sideways passing. At least we move the ball toward the opposition goal.

673~~~
I have no real issue with him coming on to win headers in the opposition area late on aside from the fact that £27m seems a lot to pay for that. But I wonder how he feels. Even if he's not good enough for us for 90 minutes, he's better than that.

674~~~
People say the same about Peter Crouch. I think when you're as tall as the two of them you don't need to learn how to jump, as you can win so many headers without needing to. They're both still very dominant in the air, so it's not just about how they are perceived.

675~~~
It's a real shame because having an advantage is one thing and working on it to completely dominate your opponent would be even better.

676~~~
Last season, when Felli would come on, he went right up top and we just bombed the ball towards him, either from deep, or back post crosses. Then he had a good run of form playing as a more attacking midfielder in a three, and the left hand side of Blind, Young and Fellaini caused all sorts of problems. This season, he comes in as a deep #8 and doesn't really get in the box all that often. It seems a strange sub to make, as usually he comes on for Schweinsteiger. I do like Fellaini, but you can't really say he does what Schweinsteiger does to a better degree.

Even when he played up front against Liverpool, we didn't play a very direct game. I think he was used very effectively last season, but this year, his impact has been quite minimal, which is more down to how he's been used rather than him himself.

677~~~
Has very good chest control but his heading accuracy is poor.

678~~~
Because it's true...It's piss funny watching Crouch give away a freekick for using his arms to win a header against midgets.

679~~~
The problem isn't Fellaini. It's how he's utilised. Last season, he was most effective on the left side of a midfield three, and we played some of the best football you'll see us play (even if it lasted less than a month). With Blind (an intelligent passer), Fellaini (physical powerhouse), and Young (pacey winger), we had a great combination of different attributes from three different players. We were far too hot to handle. 

This season, the potatoe that is van Gaal refuses to acknowledge any of his strengths other than his height, which has seen us lump to ball up to more often than not. In the game against Boro, where started in a slightly deeper role, he was one of the better players on the day and he isn't as shit as many perceive. You'd think people (including van Gaal) would know this by now.

680~~~
Agreed, the balance just isn't right with Martial/Herrera/Mata. I'd be tempted to drop Herrera on current form and stick Fellaini in there or Young with Mata as a 10.

681~~~
I thought he was poor but it feels like refs automatically blow for a foul by him in every 50/50 situation.

682~~~
He was largely ineffective and I'm not sure what LVG had in mind when he was brought on, seems to be a default change regardless of the situation.

Refs do kind of discriminate against him, if he comes out of any physical battle with the ball he gets penalised yet if he loses it then he rarely gets a foul (whether it is or not).

683~~~
Yeah, I recall at least a couple which seemed soft to put it mildly. Just that as soon as he went near an opponent it was an automatic foul.
He didnt really have much of an impact on the game positively or negatively. He made a few decent defensive clearances and held the ball up/chest controlled a couple of times towards the end to help us secure the points, but that was about it.

684~~~
It's difficult for him to only get 25 minutes every week but I thought he was absolutely terrible when he came on.

It was a performance right out of his debut season.

685~~~
I have no expectations of a significant contribution from Fellaini, so whatever he can contribute is all gravy.

686~~~
Looked clueless when he came on, he shouldn't be our first option from the bench and fact he is shows how poor we are up front.

687~~~
Absolutely pointless sub.

688~~~
I have no idea what subbing him on brings these days. Last couple of cameos he was anonymous.

689~~~
Last night, an improvement is what it brought.

690~~~
By the looks of it you are the only one who thinks that.

691~~~
Well anyone who doesn't think we played better in the 15-20 minutes after Fellaini came on than we did in the 15-20 minutes beforehand is an idiot, with all due respect.

692~~~
Yeah, I am not sure that's down to Fellaini because he brought nothing special in his cameo.

693~~~
Anyone consider selling him in the summer?We're going to sign someone definitely, our squad is fine in terms of numbers so we need to sell someone from the current first team.He's a decent option to bring from the bench but if we replace him with someone who can take us to the next level I don't think there'll be many qualms.

Just a theory so take a chill pill if you don't think it's a good idea.I just have a gut feeling that somebody's gonna be the victim of the next transfer row.

694~~~
Yes, get rid in the summer. Adds next to nothing to the team in terms of being a consistently productive Plan B. Half and half player, most of the time I'm not even sure he himself knows what he's supposed to do, just runs about annoying people. Anything approaching £15 million would be ace, and we would save about £100,000 on wages. Give more substitute opportunities to Pereira and Lingard. Maybe use the £15 million to buy a proper substitute striker to can influence games later on.

695~~~
We should have sold him last summer and got a decent fee off the back of a decent finish to last season.

He serves a purpose as a target man but I'd rather we just signed an actual striker who can play as a target man and offers more qualities. Someone like Kane or Lukaku.

At the moment he is backup for both midfield and striker. It's useful versatility on paper but in practise he's not good enough at either for a top club.

Hopefully Sunderland have enough money to buy him in January. Big Sam would surely be all over that.

696~~~
Get rid in January

697~~~
Nope.

698~~~
If he has a good tournament at Euro 2016 then we can get a good fee. He's expendable.

699~~~
I can see him going in the summer, he doesn't provide genuine competition or backup for any position in the current setup and he is basically now and impact sub and so far he isn't making enough of an impact. If he doesn't improve quickly I can see even those substitute appearances becoming less frequent this season and I see the competition only getting stronger with each transfer window.

700~~~
He's still a good option for us. If he's happy to be a squad player then keep him, we've utilised far less talented players over the years and he offers something different. It wasn't so long ago that he had a resurgence and he goes through a few games where he's failed to make an impact and now people are saying he should be shipped off to Sunderland. The mind boggles.

701~~~
He hasn't been consistent enough, he can be at good option but until he starts doing it regularly I think it is common sense to think he could be moved on. He has been here over two years now and in that time overall he has been average at best, there is only so long he can live off half a dozen or so performances, there is plenty of time left this season for hi to put it right but he will have to start doing it reasonably soon.

702~~~
I'd rather keep him as he's a fantastic alternative to anything we have. I'd rather see Mata sold and replaced long before Fellaini. But that doesn't mean I want Mata sold I think if we have quality and both are then we should keep them, but Fellaini gets criminally underrated on these boards.

703~~~
I am surprised at you Invictus. Given the in depth discussions and good posts I have seen from you in other threads, your opinion here seems overly harsh at best, and outright deluded at worst.

As to whether Fellaini should be sold or not, it depends on plenty of things including how Carrick and Schweinsteiger (both of whom are getting on a bit) continue to perform, and who (if anyone) we bring in next summer, as well as what sort of offer we receive, and the formation we play to use going forward (I am a fan of the Fellaini/Herrera offensive axis in a 4-3-3 that we played last season, and am in the school of thought that that formation would suit virtually every single player better than our current 4-2-3-1).

Fellaini offers things that other players dont - he has the versatility to play any central position from DM to striker. He presents an aerial threat and a target for the team to aim at, which is useful if we are chasing the game, in need of a plan B, or alternately if we are trying to hold on to a result. Fellaini also contributes a lot defensively, but most of his critics fail to see past "hoofball" - he makes a lot of tackles and interceptions in the middle of the park, he wins a lot of defensive headers and clearances, and tends not to lose possession much. He always tries to get into good positions to receive the ball, and never hides during games but will always continue fighting.
Speaking of the above, Fellaini's mental characteristics are almost perfect for what you want in a player. He never moans or complains, even if left on the bench after performing well. He listens to the manager and accepts whatever role he is given on the pitch. He showed a lot of mental fortitude to come out after a difficult start at the club and turn things around last season, proving many of his doubters (but evidently not all of them) wrong. He doesnt typically get injured a lot, and he brings an aggression and physicality to our side which sometimes is noticeably lacking. He isnt afraid to do the dirty work and always plays for the team first and foremost.

Fellaini gets a really raw deal from a lot of the fans. When he has been brought on this season it has often been in a defensive midfield role, and yet people are still expecting him to make a game changing contribution in the final third - namely scoring goals. Generally we have looked better with Fellaini on the pitch than when he is off it. This is from the other Fellaini thread in the Manchester United forum;

Stats are never the be-all and end-all, but similarly last season there was typically a strong correlation between the team performing well, and Fellaini being on the pitch.

704~~~
To be honest, I prefer staying out of Fellaini threads now, because the discussions become circular, but relapsed today for some reason. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

See, the thing is I don't rate him at all. Not even one bit. Didn't rate him for Everton, didn't rate him in the sham of a first season at United, didn't rate him last season despite the goals, and don't rate him now. Part of it is because I like aesthetically pleasing footballers, who are also great technically, and failing that, they have to be absolute hounds like Gattuso or Simeone; or superb producers like Chicharito during Fergie's tenure. Fellaini doesn't really fulfill any of those arbitrary criterias. It's a subjective preference, so objectivity does go out of the window at times, and some of the criticism is overly harsh, I have to admit. It's just that he is the antithesis of what I'm used to seeing as a United fan for a plan B (a role I associate with Solskjær).

And I don't rate his versatility all that much too. Being a below average makeshift striker, a below average #10, and a below average central midfielder is not a sign of versatility in my books, relative to what a club of United's stature should expect from players in those positions. It's a sign of being suckass at multiple positions. Aerial threat for what exactly? Most of the times his gross numbers are inflated by De Gea's goal-kicks. His leaping ability is so poor, as is his lack of effort in headers. Most of the times he ducks underneath instead of really propelling himself upwards, and only wins aerial duels because of his insane insane size compared to the rest of the players around him. Don't want different either. You put Papa Boupa Diop in Fergie's United and he would also offer something different. He could play at multiple positions, was an aerial threat, and could be a big target, but is that the way we want United to play? Also don't particularly rate his defensive workrate. He gets pulled out of positions too easily and we lose shape, and he shows relatively little defensive nous. All he does is he huffs and puffs with wasted motion, instead of being precise and clear in his thought process.

He never moans or complains because he lucked out when he joined United given his history with Moyes, while we passed on the likes of Thiago, who later joined Bayern because we completely dropped interest and Pep lured him there with the help of Pere Guardiola, Thiago's agent ad Pep's brother. No club of our stature would buy a player like Fellaini. Could anyone plausibly envision him at Bayern, Madrid, Barcelona; or even PSG and Dortmund? He knows the only way is down, so he keeps his trap shut. He's not proving anything. Proving something implies exemplary performance relative to the price tag and initial criticism. For ~£30 million, we got a horror show first season, a second season where he was good but still far removed from what we'd ideally want, and he has done next to nothing this season. How is that equated with proving his critics wrong?

We could sell him, give more minutes to our young players, or use the money to buy another talented young player who could contribute much more in the future (like Rúben Neves, or Leon Goretzka, who are both about to blow up, and have the potential to become world class midfielders). Our wage bill is bloated relative to the quality we have precisely because we keep £100,000 per week players for plan B. Selling him would make a lot of sense - he has reached his ceiling, his price is never going to climb up, and we could use the proceeds on someone younger, and better. That's ultimately the crux of my argument. At this point he's just making up numbers, and his sub appearances are hindering the progress of the youngins.

705~~~
Nice post, <a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a>, basically my thoughts about him too.

706~~~
A feeling I know all too well. I have been mostly adopting the same policy myself despite being on the other end of the Fellaini-scale in terms of opinion. I only came back in to this thread because I saw your post and was saddened after the excellent posts you wrote in other threads. :P

I will try to remain brief.

This says it all (or, "most of it"). Everyone has subjective preferences, I just think your resulting judgement and criticism is exaggerated and harsh.
As a "producer" - Fellaini last season provided respectable numbers for what was effectively a box to box role. The thing is, Fellaini offers a lot (in my opinion, but either way he certainly "offers") both offensively and defensively, which is something I dont think that many players do, and means that your classifications (basically a finisher, a destroyer or a playmaker) dont really apply very well. Fellaini contributes in all three of those stereotypical roles, but does not excel at any particular one.

It sounds here basically as though you are just plain old angry with him over something. "His numbers are inflated by goal kicks" - so what? It gives us an option for kicking the ball out from goal kicks instead of going short, and having a much better chance of retaining possession than normal. The same applies with defensive clearances if Fellaini is operating high up the pitch.
"he only wins his duels because he is bigger than the rest" - again, so what? I couldnt care less <i>how</i> he wins the ball, only that he does.
Similarly you talk about his defensive contribution and say he huffs and puffs - I couldnt care less what he does, he wins the ball back regularly all over the pitch.

You are talking about him getting pulled out of position and yet it was <i>his</i> ability to pull defenders out of position that was integral to much of our attacking play last season. Forcing opponents to mark him (often more than one) which in turn creates space for the other players to exploit.



This is a common problem when it comes to Fellaini. People associated him with Moyes, people blame him (Fellaini that is) for the price tag, and for not being the world class CM that we desperately needed that summer. We should have signed another CM, and we overpaid for Fellaini on deadline day as the only real signing of that summer. Fellaini joined the team with no pre-season and carrying a wrist injury for the first half of the season. Hardly ideal conditions for any player to succeed, let alone one who half of the fans basically had it in for since day one. I have said before and I still maintain that Fellaini being booed by our own supporters in preseason last year was one of the most embarrassing and pathetic things I have witnessed as a Manchester United supporter.

"<b>Horror show first season</b>" - the entire team was shite because Moyes was clueless. Fellaini had no pre-season, he carried an injury, and he was expected (by the fans and perhaps Moyes as well) to be some silver bullet who was the answer to 5+ years of central midfield issues. Moyes, despite their history, didnt even appear to know how to utilise Fellaini effectively.

"<b>a second season where he was good but still far removed from what we'd ideally want</b>" - This is subjective. You may be invested into the school of thought that Fellaini = hoofball, but as far as I am concerned, our best - and most aesthetically pleasing - football last season came from playing a 4-3-3 with Carrick holding and Herrera/Fellaini operating as box to box mids in front of him. We produced some fantastic displays and our left handed trio of Blind/Fellaini/Young was often integral to it. In addition to this, he was often one of our best performers in the big games, such as in our early games against all-conquering Chelsea, and then City a week later. He was MotM in the former, and second only to De Gea (I think) in the latter. Both times this was when operating deep, as a DM. Versatility.

"<b>and he has done next to nothing this season</b>" - the stats suggest that we have played better with Fellaini on the pitch than off it. We have other options in midfield now that we have signed Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger, and we have changed to a 4-2-3-1 formation which doesnt suit him (or any of the other midfielders for that matter). I dont expect us to build our team around Fellaini of course, but your notion of him "doing nothing" betrays your bias - his gametime has been limited and rightly so, for the most part, but nonetheless he has performed reasonably well when brought on, usually in a DM role, which is why I find it odd that people expect him to be topping the charts for goals and assists.

Do you think that having Fellaini would prevent us from signing another player? That we are so strapped for cash that the £15m you suggested in your previous post would be desperately required in order to bring in someone else?
I said myself that I am not innately opposed to us selling Fellaini and nor do I think he should be an integral first team starter, however I think that he offers a lot as a squad player and as a plan B, and that LVG likes and trusts him (although the sending off vs Hull undoubtedly damaged that a bit).
I am all for giving gametime to prospects but I dont think Fellaini is an obstacle there. Which CM/DM prospects do we have who are biting at the heels of the first team and demanding inclusion? The way United have managed youth development over the last 5 years or so has been pathetic in my opinion, but I dont think Fellaini is to blame here, its just another square peg/round hole attempt to make him into a scapegoat for something or other.

707~~~
Thing is in the unique physical nature of the Premier League it is sometimes advantageous to have a player in the mold of Fellaini. It may not be pretty but he has that grit that can unbalance the opposition's play. He has not been good this season, but he was very helpful last season. At this point it is difficult to justify his future with United, but I do see the perks of having him in the squad. If we towards the end of the season find ourselves in a position where we have to defend our lead in the table his presence in set-pieces and his ability to bully players may prove to be very useful.

708~~~
He's a bit part player of average and limited ability who will be in the last year of his contract next season. We need to bring in 2 attackers in the summer and I'd much prefer we used the bench space for Pereira and Lingard than for Fellaini.

709~~~
But why exactly do we need a player that doesn't excel in any position? What is the purpose and reasoning behind it? How many clubs like United pay £100,000 per week to players of that nature? It's a really simple question, yet Fellaini's backers never answer that. It is befuddling. Part of rectifying a mistake, is identifying it in the first place. The decision makers should realize that we erroneously signed a positional wanderer going by the guidance of our previous manager, and that the player doesn't befit a club of our stature, following which it should be considered as sunk cost. At the highest level of the sport, you want players who excel at specific roles, and if they're versatile they're superb functionally, instead of those who are subpar at multiple facets, but can do below average at them all.

Thing is, if you're an excellent footballer, and you are good at providing options, that's great. Options are subsidiary features, yet in Fellaini's case they are his primary characteristics. Good at providing goal-kick options, chests the ball like no other, below average versatility - who builds a team up in that way? Do the other clubs of United's size worry about those things instead of what the player contributes in 90 mins? No they don't. We did fine without those characteristics as primary features in the past, other clubs are doing fine without those characteristics in the present, why do we need those subsidiary options? It's an amalgamation of form and function for me, and for a lot of other United supporters. 

I didn't say I associate him with Moyes' image. What I said was that Fellaini was really lucky with the transfer, and he wouldn't be at United if not for our previous manager. I didn't say we should push him out because Moyes bought him. He should be sold because his overall qualities don't merit a role at United, or any other club of our historical standing. I didn't blame him for the transfer fee either. What I said was is that he hasn't proven his critics wrong, which entails a lot of things. Half the fans had it in for him because they don't rate him too, they didn't consider him to be a United caliber player, he isn't aesthetically pleasing (a fact that gets underrated - a lot of us started supporting United because of the swashbuckling football employed by Fergie), and he didn't prove them wrong in any way either by his general ineptitude (eg. That Bayern Munich game is arguably the worst I've ever seen from a United player in an overall cohesive team performance).

When the manager who signed him for both Everton and United doesn't know about his ideal position, that does say a bit about the player himself. It's unfair to put so much blame on Moyes, an argument I've used on his threads too. The man didn't cover himself in glory, but a lot of Fellaini's failings in his first season were of his own making. 

So what if he was MOTM in a couple of matches, and played at a decent level for a few months? Loads of average players do that, their performance level rises through a purple patch before they revert to the mean. That's neither here nor there to be honest.

The stats suggest a lot of things, but should be taken with a pinch of salt. And what about him performing at a reasonable level? Is reasonable the new standard for United players? Professional sport is cut-throat. You identify weak spots, and you rectify them, or you get left behind. And I'd expect United supporters to have a firm grasp on that concept by now. We regressed because we kept pedestrian players on, while the opposition strengthened, and kept strengthening year on year. We need to stop making that mistake again, which starts with churning players like Fellaini, who don't offer anything special. If you plan on consistently competing with the European elite, the first step in having a bullet-proof squad (there's no Fergie who can drag marginal players with him), and I'd argue he wouldn't even make the bench of those kind of teams.

710~~~
He's not very good.

..And he's not even close to being a DM.

711~~~
contd.

Where did I say we are strapped for cash? Football has become a business, and within the business paradigm, sensible investment doesn't imply United are beggars. We really need to break this cycle of keeping average players past their sell-by date, before proceeding to sell them for a pittance. Why do other clubs get better resale value for their players while United don't? It's because they sell the player one year too soon, instead of one year too late. We need to get rid, or his resale value will decline further.

LVG can trust whoever he likes. He trusted Kraft instead of signing Neuer like the Bayern board advised him, he didn't trust Ribéry who led Bayern to the Champions League under Heyneckes, kept playing Reizinger at Barcelona, he's an adamant man. His protégé trusts Obi Mikel at Chelsea. And all of that is immaterial to me, because I will form my own conclusions. And IMO, Fellaini is not good enough for United, or for any club United's size, even an a squad options.

He's not to blame, but does eat up a substitute spot. You can make a very limited number of changes and instead of bringing him on as the Plan B, it might be wiser to give time to the likes of Pereira, who has evidenced great quality in both his starts. The fact that we didn't do much youth wise in the past 5 seasons doesn't disprove what we should be doing right now. If we have to bring on a CM/ DM, I'd rather bring on Pearson or Fosu-Mensah and atleast see what they're made of. They might perform poorly, but atleast you'll give them a chance to prove themselves. If we want to bring in attacking players, I'd rather bring on the likes of Andreas, Lingard, Wilson (when fit). Instead of all the wing-play obsession, I'd argue giving chances to our own youngsters is the United Way, not bringing on a pedestrian option.

712~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Excellent post.

713~~~
January would be the perfect time to get rid of him if we wanted a decent fee, particularly if we're in the market for a player ourselves.

There will be 4-5 teams who'll be lower mid table and willing to spend big to ensure they're safe to benefit from the new TV deal next season. I can see the likes of Allardyce particularly being interested.

714~~~
Something you're fond of proclaiming, but seemingly always fail to follow through in actuality.

715~~~
I didnt say he didnt excel in any one <i>position</i>, but rather in the roles that you loosely identified in your previous post - finisher, playmaker and destroyer. Fellaini can act as a destroyer, and did so extremely well against Chelsea and City last season (one of the points you brushed aside when I brought it up later), he can act as an unconventional playmaker via flick-ons and his ability to create space for other players by drawing in defenders, and as a finisher, we have seen at both United and Everton that he is more than capable of bringing in a very respectable goal tally for a midfielder.

As for versatility, I think it is naive to dismiss that out of hand. Football is a squad game, and we can only name 6 outfield subs for 10 positions, so having players who are capable of playing in multiple positions at a good level, is something of value for the squad. £100,000 per week (I would be interested to see where you are getting this figure from that you can stand behind it so concretely - I have seen figures between 80-90k myself.) in this day and age isnt actually an unreasonable amount for a footballer at an elite club (comparatively that is, obviously £100k per week is a disgusting amount of money to you and I), I imagine that Chelsea and City pay similar amounts if not more, to players who play as much/little as Fellaini.


You keep referencing what other clubs do. I dont really care what other clubs do. But no, "options" are not Fellaini's primary characteristics, they are - as the name implies - options that he gives us, that we would not otherwise have. In my book, having more options is always a good thing.


I wasnt necessarily referring specifically to you in some of that, more the general perception Fellaini tends to get from a lot of the fans. In terms of proving his critics wrong, if you really wanted then I could dig up a thread I made last season on Fellaini, and you will find that a large proportion of people were admitting that they were wrong/underrated him etc. Your aesthetics argument is highly subjective and frankly, unfounded, as in my opinion some of our most aesthetically pleasing football last season came from playing a 4-3-3, and Fellaini was a central component of it.

Those performances and others against big clubs, were examples of his ability to perform very well at a high level in multiple positions/roles.


I agree that United are terrible at selling players, however you are essentially going by the assumption here that it is an automatic conclusion that Fellaini should be sold. If LVG wanted rid of Fellaini, last summer would have been an ideal time to do it on the back of him having a good season. Perhaps it is less about everyone at the club being clueless, and more that they simply dont share your opinion that Fellaini represents some sort of great affront to the beautiful game, and needs to be gotten out of the club ASAP.

I have Fosu-Mensah in a fantasy league that I play, so nobody would be happier than me to see him break into the first team, but evidently the club does not think he/others are ready yet. But you are talking as though Fellaini has been playing as a #10 this season, when in most of his appearances <i>this</i> season he has been brought on in a deeper role, often in place of Schweinsteiger. I think it is naive to suggest that Pearson or TFM are capable of filling Fellaini's place in the first team squad at this point in time - the latter has only started playing in the U21's this season. I never mentioned "the united way" or anything of that ilk in my post, but I would be happy to see youngsters given a chance to perform. Typically though, the time for youth prospects and cameos is when we have a lead in a game, or against a relegation-fodder team that we should be beating. A tentative nil-nil scoreline is rarely the time to be bringing on a youngster as a DM for their premier league debut.

I'd largely agree with a lot of what Invictus is saying. Fellaini's <i>okay </i>in several positions, but his versatility hasn't been anything to write home about for a lot of his time here. He's shite as a striker, because it's not his position, and the fact that we've ever used him there shows we're quite thin up front.

He's had some decent games when playing in behind the striker, but I still struggle to see him as a long-term option there: his presence up there still encourages players to hoof it, and we'd ideally want someone with more ability to control a game there over the long-term.

He actually did often play quite well in midfield last season; when he had his good spell, his overall game (which I've been critical of), looked quite good, and he offered the physical presence we'd originally signed him for. Still, he could be very dodgy positionally, and his impressive spell <i>was </i>mostly just that; a handful of decent games, which is worrying when you consider that he's nearly been here for two and a half years. Again, he did well at times, but he's not going to be a long-term option in midfield, and I'm already a lot more comfortable with the likes of Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger being there.

I'd be fine with him staying around, but I'd be happy enough if we got rid in January and got some money for him. He fits into a mold of player like Young and Valencia who have improved a little bit under LVG, and are okay options sometimes, but who are still only really here because we're a bit thin in certain positions, and are probably going to be deadwood in a year or two if we improve.

717~~~
How many clubs like United employ destroyers who are severely deficient in other parts of their game? He's not that great of a destroyer anyway. And again, I didn't brush aside the fact that he did well vs Chelsea or City. I'm just saying that a few isolated games don't really say much because even average players can do well in certain games, irrespective of the opposition. Football history is littered with such examples. What's wrong with having a conventional playmaker that can dictate the game, and take it by the scruff of the neck? Why do we have to employ a playmaker who does flick-ons and is adept at chesting the ball? Horses for courses. You feel you want to chase a game. Bring on a good striker. You want to sit back and defend the lead? Bring on a good midfielder or defender. That's what we did in the past, and that's what other clubs our size are doing right now. They don't field subpar players to do flick ons and suchlike just because he's 'vesatile'. And again, respectable is not the United standard. Some supporters might be content with where we are now, but we have to do much better, we have to get back to the level we used to be at. Fellaini won't help us get there.

But he doesn't play multiple positions at a good level. To the point of repeating what I wrote before, he is below average at all of them. The argument that the figure does not represent much in this day and age, or how much money City and Chelsea waste down the drain is not ironclad to be honest. It's never prudent to pay someone more than he's worth, instead of dispensing with his limited services. That's really basic financial management that applies in every business operation, including football. The fact remains that he is earning as much as the likes of Isco, Boateng and Rakitić, despite being a substandard squad player. We could and should be better with our wage management, and trim wherever possible instead of settling for under-performance relative to salary just because it's the norm at certain other clubs. Saving money, or utilizing it a better fashion is never unwise, regardless of how much other Premier League clubs waste routinely, and get so little return out of it, when we compare what they have achieved in continental competitions in recent years, vs what they've spent on transfer fee and wages.

Why shouldn't shouldn't care about what the most consistently successful clubs in Europe are doing right? Why shouldn't we care about what the clubs that have reached 5 Champions semi-finals or more on the trot, and have won 4 of the last 5 Champions League titles among themselves are doing? One must take note of what one's greatest competition is doing right, and try to imbibe some of those principles. One of the most efective ways of reaching our former level would be building a quality squad, now that Fergie is no longer there to provide his magical touch.

And those clubs have provided a good template for us to follow if we plan on winning the Champions League, especially Bayern Munich whose re-emergence as a Top 3 European contender has been meteoric. And I'm sorry, but having more sub-par options, instead of having quality dedicated alternatives is not a good thing in my book. When Bayern are chasing a game they can sub in a Robben for a Coman, or vice versa. When they are defending a lead the can bring on a Javi Martinez. That's the kind of competition we will eventually have to face, and we can't just half arse things by bringing on a player who has no natural position, and who isn't particularly gifted at any sub-aspect of the game. We will have to jettison the dead-weight, and bring in more quality players if we plan on competing. Fellaini is merely a good mid-table player, not United quality, especially if we plan on getting back to the level where we were at - winning league titles, and competing in the deep end of European football. Our versatile options in the recent past to be Darren Fletcher and Park Ji Sung, both substantial improvements over Fellaini in relative terms. That's what we should be aiming for, instead of settling.

The thing about mass opinion is that it can sway to diametrically opposed extremes from week to week, especially in the social media age where trends can swerve opinion. That should always be considered. I've always maintained that he wasn't good enough for United (part of the reason I don't post in Fellaini threads is because I was fed up of arguing with goldenstatesplash); and that opinion hasn't changed. The opinion might be erroneous or even harsh, but I fully stand by it. And I've stated before that my aesthetics argument was subjective. I personally don't enjoy watching him play, that is my opinion, others might not agree and that's fine, but enjoyment is one of the main reasons to watch the sport. Aesthetics is what made a Zidane, or Scholes, or Cantona so pleasurable to watch. I like players that aren't aesthetically great too. But they are generally ones that are brilliant in terms of their effectiveness. Which Fellaini isn't.

Again, I don't know what Van Gaal is scheming so I can't say what he wanted to do, or what he will do. I'm just saying that IMO we should get rid. I'm not an ITK like solidstate who knew the inner working of United, what I wrote was my opinion and I don't profess to knowing what the manager might or might do. Also, I never ever said people at the club are clueless. I'm just saying that not every decision that the club makes is the correct one, and as supporters we can discuss what we deem to be mistakes, or oversights, or even our personal aesthetic preferences.

PS: I think we should agree to disagree on this one mate. There might never be a median opinion because my take on Fellaini is heavily colored with subjective bias. And I'm afraid we'll just keep arguing back and forth in circles without arriving at a consensus, or something atleast approaching that, which would render all the to and afro futile.

718~~~
Was going to say the same. We clearly have very different views on Fellainis talents on the pitch and I don't really see any way of reconciling that. No hard feelings <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

719~~~
I think he will leave, but I am not sure he should. Purely because I think he should be played in the 4-3-3 with Herrera like last season.

720~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> are reportedly holding off on offering midfielder Marouane Fellaini a new contract, casting doubt over his future at Old Trafford.

According to Goal.com's <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2015/11/07/17089542/man-utd-to-shoot-down-fellaini-contract-hopes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kris Voakes</a>, Fellaini is eager to sign a new deal with the Red Devils, with his current contract set to expire in 2018, but the club would rather see what they can get for him during next summer's transfer window:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2587327-manchester-united-transfer-news-marouane-fellaini-cristiano-ronaldo-rumours" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/...s-marouane-fellaini-cristiano-ronaldo-rumours</a>


Despite his relative lack of action, Fellaini is keen to sign a new deal with the club to run beyond the end of the June 2018 expiry date on his current contract.

However, United chiefs are in no rush to enter into negotiations with the midfielder with his contract still 30 months away from expiry.

Sources close to the club suggest United will hope to cash in on Fellaini should he enjoy a fruitful run with Belgium at next summer’s European Championship in France, with his inability to secure regular football under either David Moyes or Louis van Gaal making him an expendable asset in the eyes of the club’s decision-makers.

The Belgium international has started just one Premier League match during the 2015-16 campaign, according to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/22738/Show/Marouane-Fellaini" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WhoScored.com</a>. He has mainly been used as a battering-ram-type substitute when the team is in need of a late goal, using his size and physicality to weigh on the defence.

The method has seen limited success, particularly in the scoring department. Fellaini's―lack of―club form stands in stark contrast to what he has done with the Belgian national team

Summer signings Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin were always expected to be automatic United starters in central midfield, and Fellaini has seen most of his minutes further up the pitch.

His chances of starting anytime soon don't look great, given the fact <a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wayne Rooney</a> and Anthony Martial are manager Louis van Gaal's choice starters at the striker position, with the former usually playing as an attacking midfielder when Martial moves inside.

Rooney is United's captain and unlikely to be dropped, while Martial has quickly become a fan favourite. As shared by Daniel Taylor of the <i>Guardian</i>, fans much prefer to see the youngster on the pitch:




Last of the dead wood that needs to be flushed out

721~~~
He secured regular first team football last season. He hasn't been used as a "battering-ram" the last few appearances either.

722~~~
You say this like his place is a given. He is far from safe. He's on a high salary and is basically a bit part player. Im pretty sure he'll be sold next summer if he doesn't step up his contribution significantly. He hasn't improved on last season and he offers very little overall.

723~~~
We gave him a 5 year contract? I thought we were only doing 4 years these days.

724~~~
I think he will be leaving too. I just think the article was a little bit inaccurate. He hasn't been given the chance to improve on last season really, considering he is being played in an entirely different role.

725~~~
He's played several roles this season, including the one he played last season. Maybe that's why he's really struggled to get into gear, but its also a problem in itself that the manager doesn't have a specific role for him. He's not excelling at any of the roles being asked of him this season, including the ones familiar to him.

726~~~
That's to be expected.We have new,better players so naturally less chance for him.Although it shouldn't matter as everyone knows what he can do and cannot do by know, and it's not like he's a young player or new to the league/team to suddenly improve his performance in the following seasons.

I do value his contribution to the team, but we need/will to strengthen to team every summer and considering LVG doesn't like to have big squad, someone has to make way and I can see Fellani being the one next summer since he's the one contributed the least this season out of our senior players.Not a fan of selling on January though unless Januzaj came back and push him down the pecking order furthermore.It's just logic, no hard feeling for the big man.

727~~~
We need another Plan B  before we sell the big guy. Can't see him being sold until we're completely comfortable we don't need such tactics or have a genuine alternative.

728~~~
He hasn't played the one he played last season. If he has it was for about 20 minutes after a sub appearance. I have no doubt that he could perform quite well if he was given an extended run, but that doesn't look like happening anyway.


We do? I don't think anyone in our midfield has performed as well as Fellaini, Herrera or Carrick did last year in the 4-3-3.

729~~~
That worked for what, 3 games? I don't think you can take that as a template for how to set up a title winning team.

730~~~
Did it ever really fail though? The match against Chelsea where we dominated but lost? After that it was just abandoned. The 4-3-3 has shown more than the current system has, or the 3-5-2.

731~~~
I am not talking about the formation, I am talking about the players and the fact that Fellaini's role is overstated and that short run of good football is too small a sample.

732~~~
Well tbf if we ever switch to midfield 3 with point back,Afroman is better player and played better in that BTB duo,then Rooney for example.

733~~~
But Rooney will not be dropped and I won't pick Fellaini over Rooney or Herrera in that role.

734~~~
Fellaini was one of our better performers at midfield since November or something though.

735~~~
He was decent and I am not saying anything otherwise. All I am saying that we need to move on and look beyond a player like him if we want to go ahead and compete with the elite in Europe. I still remember that performance against Bayern. He was like a deer caught in a headlight.

736~~~

737~~~
I'd be sad to see him go and think he made a fantastic contribution last season, but we need to move on. A club like us shouldn't have to resort to the tactics we witness when he comes onto the pitch. Not in the long term, anyway.

738~~~
Despite his very limited game time I don't think we'll let him go in January, we're pretty spread as it is. I can definitely see him gone in the summer though.

739~~~
Wouldn't surprise me especially if we bring Januzaj back or sign another player (I'm not going to the Fellani vs. Januzaj debate but Fellani might force the transfer to try to earn his spot in the Euro squad).

740~~~
Problem with that is that there is no reason at all for Januzaj to be ahead of him, beyond hoping minutes develop Januzaj.

741~~~
That was under the "unless" statement.I'm not saying that Januzaj comes back definitely mean Fellani will be behind him in the pecking order, but there's a chance that Januzaj might perform to the standard that makes the manager consider it.

742~~~
He might insist on leaving if he wants to make the squad for the Euros.

743~~~
The thing is he plays more or less the same role for Belgium as he does for United if everyone is healthy. So him leaving to confirm a spot in the Euros doesn't make sense.

744~~~
He made their World Cup team despite having a miserable season of form and injuries. Only an injury will prevent him participating in the Euros. He's their top scorer too.

745~~~
Yeah, he's a normally very important player to Belgium (mainly Wilmots who plays shit on a stick football with the talent at his disposal) but this results normally in De Bruyne having to play on the wing. With the impressive form of wingers like Ferreira Carrasco, or Mertens to play wide and De Bruyne through the middle and midfielders like Nainggolan (Witsel seems to be the mainstay as the other #6), you'd have to wonder if he can justify a starting spot at the euros with such limited club football.

746~~~
Watford is calling

747~~~
I doubt he'd want to force a transfer, van Gaal makes him the centre of our hoof ball when he comes off the bench. He must also be on excellent wages for a player of his ability.

748~~~
A much better player than people give him credit for, and players that are willing to sit on the bench a lot of the time and not moan about it are very handy.

749~~~
I concur

750~~~
I really want it to work for Fellaini at United, I'm sure he can be a good player for us.

He was an absolute nightmare to play against when he was at Everton, I just wish he had that impact for us.

751~~~
Do you really see a place for him at United once we improve upon our options at #10 and up front?  

Aside from his aerial threat and ability to hold up the ball quite well, he has little else to offer.

752~~~
I can't see him missing the Belgium squad just because he isn't playing regularly.

753~~~
And giving their all every time they get a chance, more importantly. His attitude has been impeccable.

754~~~
There's nothing wrong with Fellaini himself as a player (besides his dirty side that does no one any good). The problem is what he does to the team when he plays. It's a different game. He's basically become the poster boy for the boring kind of football that United show. Nothing works, bring him on and hope that football from the 30's saves our asses. It's not something that people like to watch.

If you break it down then he's one of our biggest earner, plays as a #10, isn't really that great. You can get players that are cheaper than him and better than him and more entertaining to watch. People know that and that is why people wouldn't mind a transfer.

755~~~
We've have been trying to improve our 10 options for a while now, easier said than done

we'll probably target muller all summer again and then next year still not have our world class options

756~~~
I struggle to see Fellaini getting much game time there with our current crop of players, to be honest.

We already have a fair few players who are better suited for the role than him technically, though it is obviously difficult to match his physicality. Even without acquiring a truly 'world class' #10, I don't think it would be too difficult for us to acquire someone who represents a significant upgrade on Fellaini. I can't see a long-term future for him at the club, especially if we want to play a better brand of football than we are currently.

757~~~

758~~~
Well he can't leave in January because we simply haven't got the squad to cope. He's still getting picked for Belgium and will get more minutes in the second half of the season. So feck off Wilmots

759~~~
This. People still seeing him as just a chest and a pair of elbows is astonishing. His technique, first touch and short passing are all very good. and has been mentioned, he is the perfect squad player really, given his attitude and current contentment to play a bit-part role.

760~~~
I think he's good, but he'll never be more than a squad player here unfortunately. Not that I dont rate him, but he doesn't fit into our style of play at the moment.

But I hate the fact that any time he comes on the majority of people instantly start whining about how shit he is and the "oh, here comes the only backup plan we have, lump it to Fellaini" bullshit. He's done really well every time he's played this year, and he couldn't be further from just a head up front we aim for. He has the best chest control of anyone I've ever seen, and it helps bring others into play when he's on and his passing is actually pretty good. And I know we lost on penos in an otherwise terrible game, but he was the best player on the pitch against Middlesborough.

A low point in the past few years was when he was booed by our own fans at Old Trafford in the friendly against Valencia, and I was fecking delighted for him when he scored to shut them up. He'll always be viewed as another one of Moyes' mistakes by a lot of fans so I'd say it's best for him if he moves on. He'd be a massive signing for a lot of clubs. I'd actually be sad to see him go though.

761~~~
Agree with this entirely.

762~~~
I think it's been beneficial he has missed the last couple of games because when we have needed goals we have kept  playing our football rather than just shoving him forward and hoofing the ball which seems to be how we use him ow. He doesn't impact the game in that role because he can't bully centre halves like a lot of people think he can, his best work comes when up against full backs and midfielders.

I don't see any point in selling him in January, not even sure who would be interested in him that he would actually want to join anyway but I think writing is on wall for an exit in the summer unless he can actually find a role where as an impact sub he has a positive effect, team has moved on and left him behind.

763~~~
I think this will be his last season with us, he showed some really good attitude last season when we were in a really bad place as a team but at the end of the day he is not good enough for the level we want to be at.

764~~~
He's just the worst.

765~~~
He's absolutely fecking shit....

766~~~
Good shout for the worst individual performance of the season.
Awful

767~~~
I bet he was fouling people at his own christening.

768~~~
LOL. Blame those who did nothing in 93 minutes.

769~~~
What's the point of a plan B if it hardly ever works? We end up playing worse than before he came on. All he does is give away freekicks and chest the ball down before conceding possession. It's like we're deliberately crippling ourselves.

770~~~
Unbelievably bad performance.

771~~~
Why does our management seem to think he's good in the air?

772~~~
Overreactions aplenty, standard for the Fellaini thread.

He did badly, I am on the way to the match thread to give him a 5 (along with much of the rest of the team), but of course because it is Fellaini people will go over the top. He was stuck up front with no service except for huge long diagonal balls from Rooney, and nobody (except sometimes Martial) within 20 yards of him. Furthermore, the PSV coach made a good substitution by bringing a third CB on, in order to deal with him.

The question I am asking is why, with PSV bringing on a 3rd CB, we still couldnt have any meaningful possession in the attacking third.

Anyway, didnt do well, nor did Martial, Lingard, Rooney, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin or Memphis (basically all of the attack and midfield).


Edit: To clarify the above, our tactics and the way we attempt to utilise Fellaini, is prehistoric. He comes on, we stick him up front and start hitting long balls to him. I hate seeing that sort of football as much as anyone else, but it angers me all the more so because Fellaini's best performances for United, Everton and Belgium have always come when he is deployed a bit deeper, like a box-to-box #10 sort. We saw it last season playing 4-3-3 with him, Herrera and Carrick, but this season we just stick him up top (or as a holding midfielder) and hit it long. Horrible.

773~~~
He didn't even look like a footballer out there today. One of the worst sub appearances I've seen from a United player I can remember. Just awful.

774~~~
Nobody is pinning all the blame on Fellaini, simply stating the obvious, which is that he's an absolutely horrible player. It'll be fecking mint to see him play for Newcastle next season

775~~~
Because he is, and he saved us multiple times last year. Today he had terrible service, and in fact play 15 minutes in the midfield. Blame those who don't how to cross.

It's not obvious. Just see 2014-15.

Plus, he just came back from an injury.

776~~~
!!
Go to bed mate, forget about tonight.

All Fellaini is, is being good in the air!

But not from balls launched 60 yards from sh!t angles.

777~~~
Nah he's fecking dreadful.

Never wins a header and even if it does he has no control over where it goes.

778~~~
He was in midfield when he came on, considering he was a replacement for Schweinsteiger.

Even when he was up front though, he was torrid. He consistently is on the verge of committing a foul, and was just really shite in the air for a player who's massive. The whole point of bringing him on was as an impact sub, but he offered nothing.

779~~~
That might have been his worst performance for us.

Not blaming him though. He's asked, at first, to slot in at CM which he's clearly got no business doing except against bog standard opposition when we're in total control, in a game where more tempo was needed.

Then he's asked to try and make something of hopeless hoofballs up front with no-one even bothering to contest the second balls.

780~~~
Never ever use the word "never" when you're wrong. If you say that he "never wins a header" then you probably have NEVER seen him playing... oooops, see, I misjudged you, just like you missjudged him.

781~~~
Fellaini should come on to add another dimension to the attack not to fundamentally change how we play- it's something that has to be addressed as it's tactical much more than something Fellaini is doing as the team noticeably changes.

782~~~
Overall 14-15 he was shite...

783~~~
Exactly, how many good crosses did we have in the last 20 minutes? How many did Young, in particular, provide him?

784~~~
Our 2nd-3rd best player (de Gea, Herrera and him).

785~~~
I thought it was going to take some effort to move Rooney at Villa Park from the top of the list of worst individual performances of the season, but Fellaini has managed it.

Just hopeless.

786~~~
Absolutely horrific display for him today. I'm usually quite lenient towards Fellaini but he does not deserve to play after that disaster of a performance.

What did he even do?

787~~~
The problem is though that it's hard for Fellaini to come on and not change the way you play. He's just such a different type of player that he's inevitably going to have that sort of impact on the side. Especially when he's replacing someone like Schweinsteiger, and he's a much more direct player playing in a side who often likes to go for more possession based play.

788~~~
I didnt think it was a bad idea bringing him on for Schweinsteiger (who was having a terrible game and for me was worse than Fellaini over the course of it) - changing to a single holding midfielder and putting Fellaini next to Rooney in a more advanced position, great! But that never seemed to be our strategy.

It just annoys me (but doesnt surprise me) how people overreact and exaggerate on here. He had a bad game, no doubt about it, but it isnt Fellaini's fault that other players (such as Rooney) insist on just smashing long, hopeful 60 yard passes to him.

I dont think Fellaini is as bad in the air as people here make out, but there arent that many players who can do anything in those circumstances. If we actually bothered to work the ball into decent positions to cross it (like Young did when he came on - unfortunately at this point Fellaini was still playing CM) then we might actually make some chances, but instead we just hoof it from deep and abandon any attempt to actually work the ball forward. Its all the more frustrating when we normally spend the game <i>before</i> Fellaini comes on spending <b>too much</b> time working the ball, and dont take enough risks.

This is a more concise and better version of what I have been trying to say most likely.

789~~~
For a supposed big man he loses too many headers. For a supposed strong man he loses too many second balls. He can't pass more than 5 yards. He can't run fast. So what exactly does he add?

To think we were going to go with him as our second choice forward had we not signed Martial last minute.

790~~~
<i>LVG: Hey big boy I need a goal.
Fellaini: Ok. I'm striker?
LVG: Yes...wait no. Hang about the half way line for 15 or so minutes first. Then people will think it's a tactical switch instead of desperation. 
Fellaini: But coach we'd have wasted most of the half.
LVG: Don't fret. I've scheduled the little midget to come on in the 83rd minute. Then WE GO FOR IT!</i>

791~~~
Said after the Watford game it was a benefit that he was out injured because we kept playing football instead of just lumping the ball to him. 

He was absolutely useless today, tactics have to share some of the blame but mata should have been brought on before him, awful decision from LVG to sub him on.

792~~~
Was a truly awful (I can't even bring myself to say performance) appearance today, completely disinterested, no fight, no effort. Just went through the motions. 

I actually think he's a valuable member of the squad, if not good enough to be a regular but he really was awful tonight. Was crying out for him in that second half. we needed a bit of fight and a physical presence yet he let a lot of people down in my opinion.

793~~~
I'm not sure what that was to be honest.

794~~~
Yeah lvg bring on that lark and give Mata 5 min..  That's it great management

795~~~
There's not particularly a lot of exaggeration, though. People are saying he had a shite game. Which is fair, because he was.

I don't see what's particularly ridiculous about us launching long balls to him, because his height and physicality mean that it's supposed to be something he's inherently good at. It's part of why we use him. He just constantly fouls people, though. He was hopeless tonight.

796~~~
Even his trademark chest control failed him today.

797~~~
How can this annoy you? He is useless at almost everything else other than using his physicality, and even <b>a) </b>he's not very good at it and <b>b) </b>that's not the style of play that fans want to see.

798~~~
He isn't even that good in the air.

799~~~
That pass he made around the 70th minute through the middle to the guy that was offside was possibly the worst pass I have ever seen a professional player put in.

800~~~
Not only do fans not want to see it, but it's not the style we play. Considering LVG's preference for possession football, Fellaini's coming on just felt incredibly bizarre. It's like LVG just has a couple of non-possession based options who are terrible, in order to convince us that we all actually do like his style of play.

801~~~
Yeah, I meant to add that in actually. It's like he thinks "we'll hoof it for the last 20 minuutes, so that they'll appreciate the turgid possession football I'll serve them next Saturday"

802~~~
I cant be bothered to dig out all the comments from here and the match day thread, but people talking about terminating his contract, it being the worst performance they have ever seen from a professional footballer etc, are exaggerations.

He was bad tonight, but in my opinion it is just as much to do with the tactics (or lack of) that we employ once he comes on. Again - work the ball into a decent crossing area and Fellaini has shown he is a threat. Hoof it up from the LB position and there really isnt much that he (or many other players) can do with it.


Anyway, right now is completely the wrong time to attempt to have any objective discussion about Fellaini (not a dig at you specifically), so that is all I will say on the matter for now.

803~~~
We are creating nothing time and time again with Fellaini on the bench. That's the problem, not him.

804~~~

Almost as bad as the legendary Bayern 'performance' which Marca refused to rate. It's really disappointing that a player like Fellaini is our plan B to be honest. Just today - Madrid brought on Benzema, PSG brought on Lucas, Atletico brought on Vietto - all brilliant footballers that can play with the ball on the ground, quick of foot and mind, and are capable of creating something out of nothing. Meanwhile we throw in a player who's useless in midfield for a possession based system, and who doesn't know what to do when the aerial route in cut out. Please get rid in the summer, or preferably in the winter, and bring in someone who consistently makes an actual impact, and doesn't necessitate an overhaul in terms of the team's approach.

806~~~
Of course there are some exaggerations. There always are whenever anyone has a shite performance.

The tactics weren't really at fault for his poor performance. I agree we should've been working the ball into crossing positions, but the problem is that when we play long balls, Fellaini is expected to be efficient in doing well with them. He's a big guy and an aerial threat. It should be his forte. Instead, he often fluffed them, and just has a frustrating knack of constantly fouling people.

To say it was the worst performance we've seen from a footballer would be over the top, but honestly, it was an absolutely terrible performance. If someone were to write a parody performance from Fellaini, based on all the aspects of his game he's regularly ridiculed for, then it'd be something close to what he delivered tonight.

807~~~
Wasn't good but that's really our own fault for relying on him to be good in those circumstances.

808~~~
Thanks for being sensible. We had THREE 0-0 in a row. Fellaini didn't start in any of those. People forget quickly...

809~~~
The thing that gets me is that every time he is stuck up front for this reason, he doesnt do well. And yet the fans still for some reason think and expect that this is what he is meant to be good at. Fellaini isnt a striker, or a target man, despite his physical attributes. He hasnt been brought up and trained in that position or role. Its not what he did at Everton and 'why' we signed him, its not what he should be doing now. Fellaini is an aerial threat from set pieces, but he has never that I can think of, shown that he has a particular proficiency for consistently winning aerial duels with opposition CBs.

810~~~
He was not great, but tonights dire performance has nothing to do with him.  

Fed up with Fellaini being the scapegoat.  Leave the poor guy alone.

811~~~
Thats as insane as it gets

812~~~
Then what <i>should </i>he be doing? He had a string of impressive performances in midfield last season, but he's nowhere near good enough to be relied upon as a genuine, long-term option in central midfield. Not only is he not good enough as a passer, or someone who can potentially control the game, but his style just clashes horrendously with our admittedly dull possession football. We know he's not a forward. But he's not a very good midfielder either.

813~~~
I don't really understand comments like this. How does a dire Manchester United performance have nothing to do with someone who put in a dire performance for...Manchester United? It was hardly solely down to him, yeah, but that doesn't excuse him from the fact that he was terrible. Especially when he was brought on as an impact sub, whose role was to change the game for us.

He's not <i>the scapegoat </i>either. He's one of many players being criticised, along with Rooney, Martial, Depay, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Lingard in the 2nd half, and our manager for his tactics.

814~~~
He was really poor tonight, but even worse he came on and completely ruined the shape of the team. That's not necessarily his fault: I mean it wasn't his decision to bring him on to flounder about in central midfield for 20 minutes. But he was sent on with 30 minutes or so to help win the game, and judged on that basis, he was pathetic.

815~~~
Unfortunately, I dont think there is a role in the current 4-2-3-1 that really suits him. In this setup you have to either be a #10 or a holding midfielder, of which I regard Fellaini as neither. Fellaini has had some very good matches for us as a DM, but its not a role I want to see him in regularly.

Last season he had a lot of good performances, and the majority were a direct result of the system we played - a proper backward-facing 4-3-3. A single holding player (Carrick), allowing both Fellaini and Herrera to play essentially as advanced box-to-box roles with plenty of license to attack, but also able to defend. Herrera was the more creative and playmaker type of the two, Fellaini was obvious the physical element.

Anyway this has all been stated before. Like I said, I dont think he is that effective in a 4-2-3-1 and I think the same about Herrera, Schneiderlin and Carrick. Basically all of our midfield. Carrick and Schneiderlin both operate most effectively as the sole holding player, and both Herrera and Fellaini operate more effectively as the more advanced CMs in a 4-3-3. I think it has hindered us substantially that LVG has insisted on changing the system to 4-2-3-1 this season and that is one of the reasons for the poor performances.

Basically as some others are also saying - it is the tactics. This sounds like an excuse, it isnt - Fellaini still played badly - but to be honest, even when he has been one of our best players it still wasnt 'good enough' for the fans. There are a lot who simply will never be happy with Fellaini in the side regardless of how well he plays (and some such as <a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> freely admit that).

816~~~
It's sad that people have come to accept this level of performance to the point where people will make excuses for the guy. Was never good enough to begin with -- even though he's played well in patches since joining. 

What's his best position? As a striker? Nope. Not good enough. Midfielder? Nope, completely pointless. Could do a job for a lesser team, but out of his depth here.

817~~~
He played quite well in a series of performances last year, but his form for us has mostly been limited to those games. Herrera has been decent at times in an attacking role this season, while Schneiderlin has generally looked solid enough despite being poor tonight.

It's very concerning though if a player can't adapt at all to a 4-2-3-1 system at all. Granted, some players will have preferred systems, but you'd expect them to be able to do <i>something </i>in most systems. It's not as if a player has to be a nailed on defensive mid in a 4-2-3-1 either: if he's playing beside someone like Schneiderlin, you'd expect Fellaini to be able to have a bit of attacking imperative and create some chances, or control the midfield. He's just not been very good there, and I feel like excuses based on the formation are ultimately a bit futile.

818~~~
I'm not a Fellaini fan and wish we didn't resort to using him as a plan B but to be fair to him he isn't playing every week and at best is making mostly cameos where we'll inevitabely lump it up to him and their defenders know whats coming. He can't play himself into form or anything like that.

819~~~
Even if he's not going to be able to play himself into form though, we'd surely at least be expecting more than the dross he showed tonight when on the pitch.

820~~~
I just found/find it incredibly annoying that LVG chose to change the system to one which in my view does not suit <i>any</i> of our midfielders - except <i>mayb</i>e Schweinsteiger. For me, Herrera's best position is as a #8, and same for Fellaini, and Schneiderlin - like Carrick - operates best as the single holding midfielder, not part of a duo. It might seem like a fairly small change in shape, but I think it makes a hell of a lot of difference.

The proof of all this for me is that our performances this season have mostly been slow paced and pedestrian. I do think that and the change of shape are purely coincidental.

Anyway going back to Fellaini, I hate seeing us hoofing long, hopeful 60 yard passes up to him as much as anyone else. I just choose to blame LVG for deploying him that way, and presumably instructing the team to play that way. It doesnt completely exonerate Fellaini - he made some very poor decisions such as passing to Martial who was clearly in an offside position - I just dont think that Fellaini can ever really be effective that way, and that it was an absolutely stupid idea to try to play hoofball against a team who have just brought on a 3rd CB specifically to counter that tactic. For a so-called master tactician, LVG tends to get 'countered' very easily by opposing coaches.

The really ridiculous thing was that when Fellaini initially came on, Young put in a couple of great crosses - but at that point in the game Fellaini was still playing CM. Once he swapped with Rooney and went up front, we abandoned crossing and started hoofing it.

821~~~
Agree entirely. He's woeful, and has never been good enough. It's embarrassing subbing him on and hoofing it long to him.

822~~~
I think there's definitely a way to have him come in without completely changing how we play. For example why push him right up with the striker? Play him as a 3rd midfielder and lets continue to dominate the ball and work our way in to crossing areas where he can then get in the box and cause havoc. You look at how he was used during his best spell for us last season, he played deeper he;ping us progress up the pitch and then got in the box. For some reason we're now just sticking him right up top and then struggling to actually work our way up the pitch. Doesn't make any sense to me.

823~~~
I dont get the point of him. We bring him on for Basti which means we immediately lose full control of Midfield we had.
We brought on Young with him but then play Fellaini at DM.

We finally swap him and Rooney, but then put Fellaini up top and put Martial out wide (instead of two up top).
We hit long balls to him from our own half meaning he cant do much with it.
And when we do get it to him, hes not doing anything with it, either he doesnt jump, (or when he does he fouls the guy), or he knocks it to an opposition player or is offside.

Hes not a good plan B at all (and it really should be reserved for the last 5-10 minutes not the last 30 minutes).

824~~~
He was a lot better in midfield last season, but the problem is that it was mostly just a good spell of form. Not to take it away from him, of course, but he was playing in a side which had managed to turn its possession football into a much more positive, attacking style. It probably helped him that the rest of the side was performing; midfielders like Cleverley and Anderson had benefited from that in the past, despite the fact that they turned out to be quite rubbish.

The problem is, though, that the style of football some believes he excels in: a direct, attacking version of our possession football, is only something we manage to deliver when we're playing well. Which essentially says to me that Fellaini is someone who isn't really particularly capable of performing well unless those around him are also doing so. Ultimately, his passing is often incredibly sloppy. As is his ball control and dribbling. His main attributes are his physicality and presence, but it just doesn't seem to fit into the side at all.

825~~~
We need to stop relying on him to get us out of trouble all the time, while he can prove to be a handful at times we need more alternatives.

826~~~
A very bad performance. You can tell by the fact that even his chest control was poor that it just wasn't working for him. People will obviously overreact and give him a 1 or a 2 in the ratings, want his contract terminated, "worst performance ever by a United player" etc. It was a bad match and he has to do better.

827~~~
This isnt really a very fair argument, since Fellaini was normally one of our better players and was integral to a lot of those performances, rather than just a beneficiary of them. You (not personally) are happy to hold Fellaini responsible when the team is playing badly, then you should give him credit when the team is playing well.

Anyway I dont think it was just a good spell of form - what happened was that teams (starting with Mourinho) recognised that Fellaini was central to a lot of our play, and so set out to stop him. Chelsea played Zouma in midfield and man marked Fellaini at Stamford Bridge - it worked, but the reason it worked was rather ironically that we didnt have any Plan B for when Fellaini was taken out of the game.

We have had numerous 0-0 results without Fellaini being involved. If memory serves we had three 0-0 games on the trot where the likes of Mata and Herrera couldnt create anything, but when Fellaini came into the team we started scoring. It wasnt a coincidence. Even when he isnt playing well, Fellaini basically forces the opponent to react - even with tonights horrible display, we saw that as soon as Fellaini came on, PSV immediately had to respond by bringing on a 3rd CB to deal with him. You can blame Fellaini for that, or you can blame LVG for not being able to exploit the fact that PSV have just brought on an extra defender, by adjusting our gameplan accordingly.

828~~~
He was like an Elephant chasing a mouse with the ball tonight, shocking stuff.

829~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of Fellaini by any means and fully agree with the limitations you've mentioned. I just think that if we are going to use him there is a better way to do it and the way we have been this season has for me been poor and that whilst he isn't an ideal player he isn't as ineffective as we're making him look or as detrimental to the team as he appears. There's a tactical element in what we do when he comes on for me which is a much bigger and more frustrating issue as it doesn't need to be that way. 

It's like if you had Lampard a couple years ago and you know he's great at getting in to good positions and nicking a goal, for me, you'd bring him on as a 3rd midfielder, continue to build the play and just have him there as someone who may get in to a better position/be more clinical. However I think with LVG he would just stick him up top with the striker and not actualy play to his strengths. Like I said with Fellaini he should just slot in to midfield and get in to the box as we get in to wide areas, opening space for others as he'll attrack defenders or winning the ball.

830~~~
He might have the odd effective game, for example I was in the Stretford End last season when he helped us smash City 4-2.

However, he is not a Manchester United player, I just don't like him in our team.  We're playing in the top competition in the world tonight and we're resorting to Championship football to try and get a goal.

831~~~
He's tall.

Despite that he does not contest that many headers (he prefers to peel off the defender and control with his chest), he does not win many headers, he wins even fewer headers without fouling somebody, and when he manages to not do all of those things and actually wins it, he has very little control of where he's heading the ball to.

He's shit in the air.

832~~~
Not sure I'd say shit, but yeah, he's not good in the air at all. Well, not for what we're asking him to do with his head and not for a man his size certainly. It's why I don't get why we lump it up to him, and why none of our players try and get near him for the knockdowns/lay-offs when we do.

He's good in the air in terms of defending corners, and running onto a cross in the penalty area (but he has to be running, forget stationary jumping), but that's about it.

833~~~
At some point you have to accept that he can't live off a handful or good performances and a few important goals, he did have af we very good games but he finished the season playing very poorly as wells one thing which a lot of people like to pretend never happened.

Since he signed he has been poor overall and there is currently very little point in him even coming on as a sub in any game because he looks lost and we end up just hoofing it to him. Hopefully LVG will start bringing on other players instead of him in future games.

834~~~
He needs to move as much as we need to replace him with a real CM. He's not going to start for Belgium at this rate with Witsel and Nainggolan ahead of him. He's getting worse in midfield by virtue of not playing there every week.

835~~~
I've said it before and I'll say it again... He's an Everton midfielder, not a Utd striker. That display last nite was a humiliation. His 'aerial prowess' is the biggest myth in football, the only 2 headers he 'won' last nite he knocked straight to PSV players. His touch is terrible and his distribution is pathetic. When he's not falling over he's clattering straight through the back of opponents or elbowing them in the face.
That said, can hardly blame him. He should never have been bought and he shouldn't ever be used, let alone be a plan B....or C or D!
When he comes on, it's a panic move, the manager panics, the fans panic, he panics and the team panic. Our shape was shambolic after he came on, it was like watching playground football with zero shape.
As I watched Fellaini stroll around the pitch last nite without breaking a sweat, while the famous Man Utd hoofed pointless ball after ball up the pitch, all I could think of was George Best spinning in his grave at what's become of "football taught by Matt Busby".

836~~~
If Schweinsteiger was fit to play 90 mins he wouldnt come on. We were worse than before when he came on and that means something

837~~~
I think that might have been one of the worst performances of someone in a United shirt. Shocking stuff

838~~~
I was starting to warm to Fellaini but the way he is used is really getting on my nerves. The minute he comes on, you know our play will become that of the Stoke under Pulis. It's embarrassing to see that in the UCL.

839~~~
Totally agree. I used to think Fellaini could be our Yaya, the kind of player who would take a game by the scruff of the neck and make things happen with marauding runs, but no such luck.

840~~~
He is wasted here and is so much better then this plan B lump it strategy. Can see him angling for a move.

841~~~
That's an insult to Stoke under Pulis though... 'cos at least when they did it it they had the right players for it to be effective and it was an actual strategy that everyone on the pitch bought into.

842~~~
Bin him. Hoofball to a guy who was losing headers to players half his size last night (and other games too) is entirely pointless and completely ineffective. 

We would have far more success giving a player like Pereira a chance off the bench. He can actually pass and beat a man, and is obviously a lot more pleasing on the eye than just launching hopeless balls into the box.

843~~~
Said this 5 pages ago, And still stand by it 1000%.

844~~~
He's giving me hopes of becoming a professional football player.

845~~~
Fingers crossed!!

846~~~
LvG does not seem to trust him. But I think he can do a decent job in midfield. Using him as a plan B lump to is really a waste.

847~~~
Bollocks player who shouldn't be at the club.

848~~~
I want to just point out that if we were putting in good crosses like Young has in the first 45 mins here, and decent balls from corners, Fellaini could actually be effective, rather than just lumping long 60 yard passes from deep.

849~~~
I am not fan of his and his performance in midweek was one of the worst performances I have seen from a sub in a while but this is a game to bring him on, there is lots of space and they can't defend set pieces, if you aren't going to play him now then there is no reason for him to be here.

Mata and Rooney are both anonymous and look like they are moving in slow motion so I think there is nothing to lose in throwing him on at half time.

850~~~
I wish he came in.

851~~~

852~~~
Fellaini as a #10 works pretty well against 70-80% of the teams in the league. He should be used more often. Throwing him on as a Plan B with 10 mins left doesnt help anyone.

853~~~
He's been good so far

854~~~
Best player for us so far today.

855~~~
Causing some issues. Certainly done more than Rooney has lately. And we aren't even playing hoofball! shock.

856~~~
this is weird I actually think he was one of the worst, he is slowing the play the most, unable to control ball and make an easy dribble.. we suffer a lot with him on the pitch don`t understand how can we start him over Pereira

857~~~
Certainly an upgrade on Rooney.

858~~~
A team like United should never have such a limited lumberer at #10, but on the bright side he's less shite than Roioney and actually competes in one on one situations.

859~~~
Are you serious? He's been terrible for me, absolutely no vision and way too slow on the ball for that role.

860~~~
Unless he's winning back possesion he's a horrible player to watch. So slow and cumbersome in possesion. Reminds me of a tree-trunk.

861~~~
This...

862~~~
He's been involved, I will give him that, however he messed up two opportunities by being selfish and then butchered that simple chance.

863~~~
Fellaini will always give his 100 percent. Whether that is good enough is open to debate

864~~~
You see the problem with him there. A real striker takes that on the half turn and tries to create a shooting chance. Fellaini just holds it up and passes it backwards, and the chance is gone.

865~~~
And again. Gets it stuck under his feet and is closed down.

If we wanted to see what we could do without Rooney we needed to replace him with someone other than Fellaini.

866~~~
Pretty much any of the other outfield players would have scored the chance Martial put on a plate for him, but he just lumped it without looking into the keeper. Had half an empty net, or a chip, or any 'finishers' finish and we're ahead. 

Sigh.

867~~~
Not good enough, we will be a better team once he is sold and replaced in the summer.

868~~~
He did his best, he's a very mediocre player when you are tying to use him as a ground based #10, did better when simply tasked with competing in the midfield, although I'd have took him off instead of Schweini who offered more quality supporting the attack.

869~~~
He was pathetic in the air today..  Didn't even bother to challenge at times.

Then again, he's not very good in the air unless the ball is pinpointed to his head, so it shouldn't be surprising.

870~~~
He does well as a midfielder - running at defenders for headers and hassling players. He did that in the first half and was much better than what he has been this season.

For most of the second half, he was awful. He can't play with his back towards goals and is slow on the turn.

871~~~
That cross that Carroll won despite Fellaini having prime position had me raging. He just had to win that header! 

I disagree on the 2nd bit though. Fellaini is good in the air, but sometimes he just can't be arsed to go for it. When he wants to, he can be so hard to beat. He won a lot of aerial balls in the first half with ease. Then he just seemed to decide he'd had enough.

872~~~
I'm beginning to think he's the opposite of Rooney...

He is a midfielder that is best ghosting forward. Rooney is a forward that is best ghosting into midfield.

Neither man appears to have the consistency within them to be able to reverse that when needed.

<span style="color: #ffffff">And I backed him to do better as a 9.</span>

873~~~
I thought he did ok but he is a limited player that offers zero creativity which makes him a huge hindrance if he is one of the attacking four.

He and Mata were the chief culprits of slowing our play and dragging the team backwards today.

874~~~
Time to sell him this summer. Has a nice little run last season, but over the course of 2 and a half seasons now, he's simply not sort of player Manchester United can afford to be fielding. When he's bright he can be a pain to play against but when he's, and for most of his United career under 2 manages he's not been bright, he'd downright unfit to play for this club.

875~~~
Hard to be mad at him. He's doing his best and he does have decent link-up play now and again but he's not a forward. Never has been a forward. 

He's a midfielder. Not good enough of a midfielder to start but that's what he is.

876~~~
Surprised so many thought he was one of our best today, think that might say more about the quality of players around him right now than Fellaini's actual performance.

He did ok today but he does frustrate the feck of me when i watch him, i've seen elephants on youtube with a better first touch. Seriously though how does someone train with a ball for a few hours everyday for years and still have such an atrocious first touch.

877~~~
He should have scored but I didn't think he was too bad. In the grand scheme of things he isn't good enough. But within his own parameters of performance, that was actually one of his better games this season.

878~~~
Ronnie Corbett is more of a threat in the air 

<span style="color: #ffffff">And yes, I robbed that</span>

879~~~
Patiently waiting for him to leave. I know I sound like a real cnut but I just find it painful to watch him play.

880~~~
I was happy for him last season and he did well but I'm back to where I was before then. Has to go, I just don't like seeing him on the pitch at united.

881~~~
Really surprised by the negativity. I guess the fact it is Fellaini means he will come under some criticism though. He should have scored that chance Martial made for him but he also should have won a penalty in the first-half I thought. He hasn't had any continuity this season so it was a decent outing.

If Herrera had missed that chance I am sure he wouldn't receive the same criticism.

882~~~
It was frustrating as feck today to watch Fellaini play at no10 while Mata a much better no10 and left footed was stuck out on the right wing. To add insult to injury we actually had two actual right footed wingers sitting on their arse on the fecking bench. Baffling.

Fellaini is a good player and he has his uses, but he really shouldn't be playing up there unless there is literally no one else available.

883~~~
No one is mentioning his stamp from today? Another one of his specialties.

Herrera received much more criticism for games he was actually playing much better than Fellaini today. Even from his fans(me included). Herrera's worst performance this season was probably nothing worse than Fellaini's today and yet Fellaini got some praise today. He was absolutely terrible.

884~~~
I feel sorry for this guy, getting slated because he is a different kind of player which isn't suiting the precious Utd fans, he haven't been terrible at all.

885~~~
We aren't taking ourselves seriously enough if a player like him is a forward at this club. Sounds like something west brom should do.

886~~~
Mata floated inside quite often and was shite. He has been shite for weeks now and done very, very little when played as a number 10. Maybe at Chelsea he was better than Fellaini in that role, but I would suggest that since both have been at United there is probably very little between them in terms of performances as the AM.

Except he wasn't? 88% passing accuracy, created 3 chances, had 2 interceptions and a block. Plus 4 shots (yes he should have scored). He wasn't brilliant, sure, but he was better than Mata and just as good as the other attackers.

887~~~
Whike I've never been his biggest fan and I won't miss him when he's gone next season, we've got bigger problems than Fellaini right now.

888~~~
We have a problem here. Last season van Gaal essentially created a role in that Blind-Young-Fellaini triangle for him that played perfectly to his strengths and he did very well in it. Now that role no longer exists he's back to being as limited as we all thought he was. There are three or four roles available to him now and he's not good in any of them.

Thanks for helping dig us out of a hole last season but if that system's been abandoned then there's no place left here.

889~~~
It has nothing to do with the precious Utd fans, he doesn't suit the team he is playing for. He has shown that he was a good player but for a different system.

890~~~
So many football snobs.

He did more in that game than Rooney has for ages. He held the ball up very well to the point we could actually spend more time near the oppositions goal instead of on our half way line like most games.

He was a pest in the box. Look at how many scrappy clearances West Ham had to make that ended up landing at our players in the box because he was causing them trouble.

To have a go at him for that game is just mental. Unfortunately people have it out for him.

891~~~
Thought he did OK and was one of our better players yesterday

I think he deserves a run in the team

892~~~
Yeah i would disagree with that. Mata hasn't set the world alight but he has as i said been shunted out to the right 90% of the time but even out of position he's shown more than Fellaini for me. I would rather see Mata in there poor form or not than Fellaini who i don't think is a no10. And an actual winger out right, would have been a much more balanced team. When Depay came on and we had him left and Lingard right we were causing them more problems.

I like Fellaini and he has his uses but not as a no10 for me.

893~~~
Absolute shite.

Still better then Rooney.

894~~~
Got away with that stamp <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

895~~~
It wasn't a stamp.

896~~~
I get that people don't want him as the future of the club but I seriously must have seen something different to a lot of you yesterday.

I thought he held the ball up really well which meant he was able to bring the other attacking players into the game, a couple of nice flicks and through balls, caused a few problems for their defence, should have done better with his only clear cut chance, but all in all, not a bad game for someone lacking match rhythm. 

I would be all for giving him a run of games.

897~~~
Only just noticed his avatar at the top of this thread. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

898~~~
Played quite well yesterday, interestingly these are the chances created stats per 90 minutes played updated after yesterday's game.

Fellaini - 1.88
Mata    - 1.87
Herrera - 1.39
Rooney   - 1.03

899~~~
Oh really? I think it was clear as daylight he knew exactly what he was doing. It was sneaky.

900~~~
Provides much more than Rooney this year. He's a less talented footballer than Rooney was but in terms of performances he's ahead of him in the number 10 position.
Then, regarding the team, he's not the fastest man alive, and he slows it a lot.

I don't understand why LVG changed a formation when he used Herrera + Mata + Fellaini and Carrick in their top positions to a 4-2-3-1 where neither of them are confortable ? 

Fellaini was top last year as a second 10 with the ball or second 8. He wasn't creative but supported the attacks so well. 

LVG found how to use him efficiently but not anymore

901~~~
He’s a handy player to have in the squad for when things aren’t going well as he can provide another option. That said he is becoming the emergency option far too frequently in my view. He didn’t have a bad game on Saturday but he didn’t offer anything of any real substance (not that any of our team did). I commended him last season but he seems to have reverted back to his awkward self. Quite frankly we have better options for the 'number 10' position. I think the system we played last season when he thrived is the only way he could flourish in this team so unless LVG reverts back I can see Fellaini being a square peg to varying degrees wherever he's played. At least we've realised that he's not a DMF anyway because he was god damn awful playing in that role. He's much more suited to the attacking side of the game.

I’ve never thought he is a ‘United’ player and that isn’t being snobbish, it’s simply based on the types of player we’ve had in our recent past. The signing of Fellaini was against the grain of the players we were used to.

I don’t like this devilish side of his game like the stamp on Tomkins. We saw him do McShane last season and there is no doubt he left his foot well into that challenge with Tomkins knowing it would connect with him. I’m all for a hard tackling player with a bit of edge but don’t want someone who just decides to flirt with the prospect of outright injuring opposition players. There’s a lot said about his physicality and while he does use it I don’t think he’s a that great at heading the ball or indeed even winning aerial duels. I also think he’s too slow between first touch and passing it on. He sometimes seems to take an age to get the ball 100% under control and ready to do something with it. Maybe that’s simply down to his gangliness!....

Fellaini is Marmite for a lot of fans but I think he’s got something to offer given the right circumstances, which should only arise now and again. That’s said I think we have better options for our starting line-up and wouldn’t be disappointed if he ended up leaving the club

903~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How many times do I have to say Fellaini is not and will never be a decent midfielder. He is good at being a target man or a suffoco and anything beyond that, I would not have him anywhere in the team. I am baffled that he was choosen over Carrick.

904~~~
This isn't the type of game where you play him in a midfield 2.

905~~~
He has to come off at half time if we are to have any chance in this game, he is constantly out of position and is leaving midfield wide open. He is tactically and positionally inept, he needs to be in a role where that doesn't matter.

906~~~
He's not good at <i>anything </i>other than being awkward, tall, and chesting the ball under zero pressure.
He's not even good at heading the ball.

Needs three touches to do what good midfielders can do with one. And still does a worse job.

907~~~
I'm not sure it's the type of sport where you play him in a midfield two.

908~~~
He's been so shit. Why him over Carrick, feck knows

909~~~
He is absolutely woeful. Started off decently holding his position and then completely abandons his midfield role for the last 30 mins. What is that plank doing standing on the left wing!

910~~~
Awful move from LVG playing him in a midfield 2.

911~~~
I don't know if it's tactical or not but he's pushing high on the left way too much for me in open play. I get it for a goal kick and he should definitely try and break in the box when he can but we're leaving ourselves needlessly open on the counter and having Mata needing to come short for no reason. Sometimes that tactic is useful but in today's game we don't need it and I we'll be quicker and more solid if he stays deeper.

912~~~
very true<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I dont fecking understand why we need to play him ahead of someone already better than him like Andreas pereira who add much more balance to our play and much more mobility with the actual ability, play him next to basti and he will in this kind of game control the game like he did against DOns in his debut..

913~~~
He's a complete ball-watcher. He has zero intelligence as a footballer. Slow to react to everything, and slow to read the game.

914~~~
What a terrible transfer he was. Fecking Moyes.

915~~~
I don't understand where was he for their second goal? He was not on my television screen and I could see about half the pitch. Why the feck is he so high up when he is a holding mid?

916~~~
Nearly scored from that corner early on but other than that he's been really bad, poor passing and giving the ball away too much.

917~~~
I think he should come off for Carrick for sure

It wasn't really that he was poor today but failed to have any impact. He usually does a lot more when he starts a game

918~~~
He is not a very good footballer.

919~~~
Any manager, and I mean any manager, who gets rid of that useless sack of crap will have my backing irrespective of anything else.

920~~~
He has been poor. Completely abandoning your midfield role does not mean has had no impact. It only means his impact was negative because Wolfsburg are cutting through our midfield as only BFS is trying to hold the fort while Fellaini is meandering somewhere high up the pitch without the first clue of what he has to do.

921~~~
a football game?

922~~~
I was actually pleased before the game that he was in midfield because it meant we'd play Martial up top, but he's really not given me any confidence that he's going to find form in midfield either.

923~~~
Just facepalm. He's a plan B to throw on in the 70th minute. Not a starter for a CL team

924~~~
Is it tactical though? I haven't seen anyone shouting at him to stay deeper and it's similar to what we've seen before from him, albeit typically when he plays as the spare man. Either way we don't need it in this game whether it's tactical or him just going awol.

925~~~
He has no concentration at all, quite clearly.
Other than 'nuisance factor', he's below par at everything. He's <i>sometimes </i>tidy, but still needs three touches for things midfielders should do in one.

926~~~
He's an awful midfielder but it's Van Gaals fault for playing him there. Did he not watch the second half against PSV?

927~~~
So that wasn't just me. Schweinsteiger was appalling for that goal for sure but where was Fellaini? It's not like it's him pressing the CB's, it's Mata and Schweinsteiger that are doing that.

928~~~
One of the most useless players I have seen pull on a United shirt. What is he? 

Thank but no thanks, David..

929~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

930~~~
Waste of a shirt, dont know why he gets so much gametime considering LvGs objectives. Offers an option from set pieces but other than that he's a liability on the ball and off it.

931~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

932~~~
A turd that needs flushing.

933~~~
Where else is he going to play him? Fellaini's not a striker, and any decent form he <i>has </i>had for us has generally come in some sort of midfield position, whether it be a more defensive or attacking minded one.

I'd rather we weren't playing Fellaini at all, but if we're going to play him anywhere then you'd expect it to probably be midfield.

934~~~
Don't see that as tactical as he was doing just fine for the first 10 mins. I have mo fecking clue why he has to stay up as the farthest man when even Martial was tracking back. Once noticed that Wolfsburg sprang a counter while Fellaini was ambling back as he was the farthest forward for us. He is playing exactly like he was under Moyes. A fecking disgrace.

935~~~
It's hard to see a reason of keeping him beyond this season. He's not a player that should be starting for Manchester United. Had his purple patch last season but everything else has been bang average.

936~~~
I agree it's odd, just think it's odder that none of the coaching staff/players were telling him to stay deeper/more central. It's questionable either way.

937~~~
I'm going to dump this all on Fellaini. He's to blame for everything. We were the champions, he is our only signing and we finish 7th. We've changed managers, we've made a lot of transfers and tactical changes but the common denominator for our worst period of football in the PL era is Fellaini. We need to sell him purely for superstitious reasons.

938~~~
First half was as lazy and poor tactically as I can remember from a utd midfielder, should never play in a midfield two again. He was better in the second half but that wasnt much of an achievement.

939~~~
Dude is in his third season with us. Hasn't scored 10 goals in total, is worse in CM than Tom Cleverly. Seriously what the feck is he still doing here

940~~~
He's shite. That's it. Shouldn't be at united.

941~~~
Probably about time to stop trying to polish this particular turd. Maybe Stoke would be interested?

942~~~
He was our biggest attacking threat chansing the game.

Which is more of a indictment of our play under LVG than anything.

943~~~
Absolutely terrible first half. Improved in the second, but was still no better than average at best.

944~~~
It wasn't obvious to me what his instructions were. If he was meant to be playing as a holding midfielder then his first half performance was bizarre, as there was a gaping hole where our midfield was meant to be.

945~~~
His shit. I never seen a player who has such slow thought process as him.

946~~~
He's not a midfielder. And the amount of times he surrenders possession/attacking pressure by making a silly foul is so frustrating. He was good in the last 10 minutes, but he is just all over the place tactically, there isn't a single position on the field you would be 100% content on playing him in.

947~~~
Nah, Mata and Martial offered more.

948~~~
4.4 in the match rating. Load of bollocks.

He was one of two or three to come out of that match with some credit. He created about 4 or 5 decent chances and set up the second.

There's plenty to criticise about him but not tonight.

949~~~
Almost all of our best chances came from Fellaini winning a header or causing nuisance in the box or around it.

950~~~
I don't feel we are any more likely score with him on the pitch

951~~~
From set pieces he was good but that was about it. Would gladly never see him start a game for us again but he will probably have to start at a the weekend.

952~~~
Nah, not sure I can really agree with that. His aerial threat wasn't always all there tonight, and "causing a nuisance" seems to involve him giving him away fouls half the time.

953~~~
4.4 seems high to me.

954~~~
He tries hard bless him but it's like watching an Ent play football.

955~~~
Trying to see reason in the Fellaini thread is a lost cause on Redcafe. I gave it up after last season.

956~~~
When he is that poor you just have to take it on the chin.

957~~~
Its easy to make a scapegoat out of him - an opportunity that few seem to pass up.

958~~~
What was his position today? He was listed as a midfielder but he completely abandoned Schweinsteiger.

959~~~
He's not a scapegoat though when you consider that he's hardly the only one getting criticised. Rooney was getting slaughtered, as has Darmian on a regular basis. Schweinsteiger's been getting plenty of criticism for tonight's performance. Then there's the criticism going in LVG's direction.

Fellaini's not a scapegoat - just someone performing incredibly poorly, and getting criticised for it.

960~~~
Scapegoat or not his first half performance was shocking, no one can say otherwise with a straight face.

961~~~
Genuinely think, all things considered, he's one of the worst players I can remember parading round for us. 

For what he gives us you can sign any lower-league clogger and get the same out of them as we do Fellaini. Hell, you might even get more out of them, because objectively he's actually pretty bad in the air (he's lost over half of the duels he's gone for in the air, and thats not even including the ones where he gets penalised for fouling people) He makes us worse in midfield when he plays, he makes us worse up front when he plays. 

He's got a very limited role to play here as an auxiliary attacker (but even then, I think we should have less limited players doing it) but he should not be starting games in either of the positions he has over the past few days.

962~~~
I hope I will wake up tomorrow and find out that we never bought him.. I was wrong he will never ever be good enough for us..

963~~~
Being scapegoated tonight for sure. 

But it's pretty obvious he's not good enough.

I do sometimes get annoyed when we DON'T hoof it to him. It can cause panic and make things happen when time is off the essence. Especially annoying when we end up hoofing it to Martial whilst Fellaini is nowhere near. 

Anyway, fair play to him for coming out and facing the press in the interview. But his days are numbered.

964~~~
Well its on the <i>"performing incredibly poorly" </i> that the disagreement stems from. Fellaini created our second goal tonight and created several chances in the Wolfsburg penalty box through flick-ons. On the ball, he was mostly pretty tidy and didnt squander possession - if you are expecting him to be a creative force from midfield then you are always going to be disappointed because that simply isnt his game and not what should be expected of him (I highly doubt LVG puts him there expecting to see the embodiment of Paul Scholes in an afro after all).

What I would like to know is <i>precisely</i> what he did that merits the level of criticism he is getting tonight - being called a turd and what-not - because in the match I was watching he was not visibly worse (or better) than most of the other players.

965~~~
Not really his fault but it will certainly be a good sign when we improve to the point where he's sold.

966~~~
Lets be honest, though, he was ridiculously lucky not to be penalised for that. He was climbing all over the Wolfsburg defender.

967~~~
If it was any other player, I dont think you would be saying that. Referee's have a tendency to penalise tall players for no apparent reason, and tonight was no exception. "Climbing all over" Dante is simply an exaggeration - it would have been extremely harsh to call it a foul in my book, unless you want to make the game into a non-contact sport.

968~~~
His header was decent for the second goal, yes, but it was an almost comical goal in that Wolfsburg should've dealt with it incredibly comfortably.

He wasn't great on the ball, to be honest. He's incredibly awkward with and his touch is almost always off. Most of his passing would often just go backwards to the defenders because he lacks the confidence to drive forward with it, and that's what he <i>should </i>be offering. If he doesn't, then what's the point of playing him as a central midfielder? We know he's not a dictator of play. He's not a positionally minded defensive mid. He's not known for his brilliant tackling, or regular interceptions. If he can't offer an attacking threat while driving forward with the ball, then why are we playing him in midfield?

His positioning was also horrendous at times, like it often is. I'm not sure he really knows where he's supposed to be playing a lot of the time, as his positional discipline is terrible.

969~~~
Of course I would, he had two hands on Dante's shoulders and used them to gain leverage. It's a free-kick.

At the time, and even now, I don't care about it. But there's no real point denying that its a free-kick.

The fact Fellaini got away with it, who I agree with you often gets penalised for things that aren't fouls, just makes it more surprising.

970~~~
He's absolute dross.

He can't play in midfield, and if we wanted a target man to sub on then sign an actual striker to do just that.

It's like watching a rubbish version of Ricky Lambert play in midfield.

971~~~
Pathetic the lengths people go to to try and make out he played well, no harm in admitting he was useless. His laziness tracking back just isn't acceptable.

972~~~
Is it really hard to just give some credit to the man at some point without feeling the need to qualify it with endless "but" statements? He won a header in the box from a corner which caused problems for the Wolfsburg defence, resulting in a goal. You can pick apart virtually any goal to find ways that it 'should' have been defended, ultimately it doesnt matter unless you can call it a true defensive 'howler' - which I dont think it was in this case.


As far as "why are we playing him in midfield" goes, that is a question to ask LVG, and not something I would really be pegging Fellaini with as a criticism. LVG knows what to expect from Fellaini and gives him a role in the team accordingly.

Going back to performance, you need to understand and appreciate that when Fellaini is receiving the ball it is more often than not with his back to goal. He is also usually tightly marked. Not an excuse per-se, but rather that when he is in a position to play a forward pass I think Fellaini normally does so with average success. However compared with other midfielders he is less likely to be in a position to make a forward pass, as he is (presumably by instruction) playing further up the pitch and with his back to goal.

I agree, positioning is not one of Fellaini's strengths and one of the reasons I think it is risky to play him in a midfield pair. That said, I think it was obvious tonight that the instruction was for Fellaini to play further up the pitch and have Schweinsteiger (and then Carrick) in a deeper role. I agree with you here though, and it is why his best performances for us came last season in the more advanced CM role alongside Herrera, with Carrick in a holding role behind. That 4-3-3 system gave both Herrera and Fellaini license to roam forward without too much need for positional discipline, and it brought out the best in both of them I think.

973~~~
Ill need to see the replay a few more times to really be confident either way, but for me at first glance and on the replays shown during the game, it wasnt a free kick.

974~~~
Yup.

975~~~
It wasn't really <i>that </i>great a header though, was he? He managed to get some contact on it to nod it down on the ground with decent enough power, and it somehow managed to end up leading to a comical own goal. If he'd netted a genuinely excellent header, then yeah, I'd be happy to praise him, but I don't think there was particularly much impressive in his header.

And you've advocated playing him in midfield, especially when people were slating him for playing up front. I get that you think he's best as the front player in a three-man midfield, but there's got to be some sort of ability from him to adapt and at least play competently in numerous midfield systems. At the moment, he isn't showing that at all and just looks out of his depth whenever he's in our team. Positioning is a massive weak point for him, which isn't really good enough. I struggle to see how any midfielder can succeed if they're poor positionally.

976~~~
I cant see him starting for any other top team, and there is my issue with players like him and Valencia.

977~~~
Seriously, play him behind the striker or not at all.

978~~~

979~~~
Don't care if I never see him again.

980~~~
Even at 10 he's not the force he was at Everton. I'm yet to see a performance that screams dominance as he did with them and for Belgium (he plays in midfield for national team)

981~~~
It's so bad I actually find myself laughing at times.

982~~~
I don't understand how he managed to look pretty good for us last season, but this season he's just a complete liability. 

Did the 433 help him that much?

983~~~
Jesus Christ. How have we ended up in this position?

984~~~
You guys are right, Fellaini is after all the first and only player to fail an attempted backheel. Jesus.

985~~~
Back to the bench please Marouane. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">And I backed him as a #9 at the start of the season.</span>

986~~~
Apologies. First mistake in an otherwise startling United career.

987~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this thread.

If you ever want a true reflection of Fellaini's performances you basically have to half the abuse and criticism he gets. People go way over the top.

He had a poor first-half though for sure. I'm not sure if it was his decision of LVG's, but he was on the left-wing too often. If it wasn't van Gaal's then someone should have told Fellaini from the bench after about 25 minutes but no one seemed to do that?

Improved in the second and was a good attacking threat. Not sure about the second goal being a freekick (whichever poster said that), loked like a good header to me? Anyway, not a good performance considering he and the rest of the team should be better than that. Was not our worst player though.

988~~~
Its sad when so-called supporters orchestrate a witch hunt against one of our own players, thats the underlying point here, however you want to dress it up.

989~~~
No, it's not. The vine was just a short summing up of his career here so far. Very frustrating purchase

990~~~
Should have went last summer. Did a decent job for us in the second half of last season. His time has long past at United. Not what we need.

991~~~
Still better than Rooney.

992~~~
Yeah, time to move him on I think. We're obviously not going back to the 4-3-3 system which played to his strengths excellently without hindering the rest of the team so there's not much point in him being here. In 4-2-3-1 there isn't a position for him. If we want a target man we may as well sign a burly striker like Pelle who has more about him. In an attacking sense, Fellaini is at best very ordinary at everything besides dominating in the air.

993~~~
Considering his positional ability, he'd probably end up in the stand accidentally instead.

994~~~
I didn't understand why he played so far up the pitch, leaving a pretty immobile Schweinsteiger all at sea. I've been wanting to see one of our two CM's support our attack more this season, but that was just ludicrous. In a way it's symbolic of our plan A being too cautious and our attacking approach (when eventually coaxed out of us) being rash and gung-ho.

995~~~
4-2-3-1 suits none of the midfielders

996~~~
Hahaha, you're not wrong tbf. Never really thought of it that way!

997~~~
I've defended him but it's time to sell.

998~~~
Can we please just terminate his contract? I'd rather take a financial hit on him than risk having him available to be played. He's just awful.

999~~~
When he plays, he has to be in the "10" position or as a part of a midfield 3. That's the only way he can be allowed to roam forward and join the attack at the first opportunity. In a midfield 2, you have to be smarter than that and tonight he was not. Kept going forward or drifting wide left and it left us so short in midfield and exposed on the counter.

1000~~~
I was cursing him initially for refusing to try and be a CM, but then I realised it was under instruction from LVG. On that basis, I'm willing to give Fellaini some leeway.

1001~~~
I think we can convert him into a CB. This is genuine idea, not a pisstake. He's a good header of the ball, strong, has good positional sense. Drawback is that he's a tad slow and a bit shit with the ball in his feet, but surely that's a position we can use him when we're like today short of defenders?

1002~~~
His positional sense is terrible. He was all over the place in tonight's game. He's not even particularly brilliant at heading; he's just big, so naturally heads the ball a lot. I wouldn't be surprised if we utilised him defensively because of how thin we are at the back, though. He would at least offer us a presence defensively, and could just clatter players if all else fails.

1003~~~
Useless

1004~~~
In midfield that is. In defence he I think can do better tactically. He's not brilliant at anything(apart chesting) but at least he'll probably be useful against limited and slower but more physical strikers. In any case I think at CB he'll do the least damage..

1005~~~
So because he is shite as a midfielder and shite as a forward, we should try to fit him as a CB? He would be a fecking disaster. No positional sense, no ability to read the game or read danger, slow as feck and he is awful with the ball at his feet.

Would be a nightmare to see him there.

1006~~~
So in one post you say that he is not a creative force and something that should be expected of him. In the next post you infer that his best games came as an advanced CM and thus that is his best position. What exactly does he provide higher up the pitch except for the odd flick ons if he is not a creative force. 

Furthermore you claim most of his passea are backwards because he is playing with his back to goal. Many players do that, that does not mean they dont know how to turn with the ball. What good is he playing up front if he passes the ball straight back as soon as he receives it. That is one thing Rooney gets slagged off for as well.

His contribution is awful defensively and average at the best of times in the offense. What exactly, apart from some headers and flick ons, doea he provide to this team if he cannot play as a CM? If that is all we want, I would rather we go for Andy Carroll.

1007~~~
He is the bane of my existence and a tragicomic figure. 

The protagonist and avatar of the post-Ferguson era. Signed by Moyes, retained by Van Gaal and the next manager will offer him as a sacrifice to the football gods. Only then will the curse be broken. 

Unlucky not to score today.

1008~~~
He is consistently terrible, and will be looked back on as the worst, most played player ever to west a Utd jersey.
His passing is terrible, his touch is brutal (other than his 'chesting'... Let that sink in for a second, a Utd player is constantly praised for his cheating ability.... How the mighty have fallen!). His aerial threat is the biggest myth in football. He's a constant red card liability. 
The lad is an Everton midfielder who has a limited few decent performances once every season and that's all he'll ever be. He offers nothing for Utd except an excuse to revert to hoofing the ball aimlessly. He destroys any formation with his complete lack of positional play.
The only good thing he done lastnite was stay out of the way and was basically a spectator. A truly terrible footballer in the Djemba Djema category.

1009~~~
He would give away a penalty and get sent off every game. He's all elbows, bad tackles and surprised looks when the ref blows him up. 
His role at Utd should be limited to changing light bulbs and checking smoke alarms.

1010~~~
Not really much wrong with that. Going for a creative idea like a backheel and it not coming off isn't a big deal.

More importantly, Fellaini really isn't good enough for United. I don't think he can be considered a midfielder anymore as most of his work tends to happen in the attacker third of the pitch (between no10 and second striker). And while he <i>can </i>be a good option to bring on <i>sometimes </i>to unsettle teams, it's questionable whether we want to keep someone like that at the club when he's inevitably going to be used more frequently, because, well, the guy wants to play football, and hence starts important games, and becomes your "go-to sub". We have to aim higher IMO. You want to bring someone off the bench like PSG can bring on Lucas to bring insane pace in, or Barca could bring on Pedro. Or we used to bring on Hernandez (when we used to play counter attack).

1011~~~
As bad tonight as he's ever been.

But yet, I don't hate him anymore. And by that, I mean I don't get this rage filled emotion in my body every time I see him in a United shirt, plodding about the pitch, doing feck all.

That progress, right?

1012~~~
Ridiculing a guy for an attempted backheel is a bit cheap. After every match people carry on about our lack of creativity and taking no risks, yet when someone does try something and it doesn't come off they use it as a stick to beat him with.

1013~~~
And it's not a skill with high success rate either. Sometimes it comes off sometimes it doesn't. Nothing to mock unless you just want to go "fellaini lol"

1014~~~
But surely there's a difference between showing attacking intent when the club is struggling for goals and trying to showboat when the team is losing and needs a win to stay in Europe? 

I just hate seeing him play a deep midfield role for us, and the less said about him up front the better. So I guess you see where I stand on the subject.

1015~~~
well...pretty much. He was good at advanced role last year, but seems to have taken a huge step backwards. Then again he will not prosper as CM as he lacks the tactical discipline and positional sense there, also the pace, skills etc, but if we move him into defence I guess he can have better positioning and tactical discipline there. I mean I don't think we can sell him and I don't think he can develop in midfield and seems like plan B is not working when he's in the hole, so what to do with him?

1016~~~
Of course we can sell him and we will.

1017~~~
I only really felt like that about him when Moyes was in charge. He grew on me somewhat last season although his limitations were still abundantly clear despite the overrating by some on here. This season he's been generally poor and I've now resigned myself to the fact that he's just not good enough. When I see his name on the team sheet, I just get this inevitable feeling that he won't do anything of note during the match.

1018~~~
I just die a little inside when I see him play for us...
What team of our stature would have Fellaini in his squad? Even worse in the first 11? Real ? Barca ? Bayern ? Never in a million years!

1019~~~
The thing that is so frustrating with him is how we use him. If we kept his role simple, just break up play and get forward for set pieces/where we're gonna cross it in the box then he could be effective if not ideal. But we seem to give him way too much freedom when he just does not show the football intelligence or technique to justify it. 

Yesterday we let him push up high on the left a lot and I just couldn't understand why. I get it for goal kicks but in normal play he shouldn't be so far forward that we have a big gap in the midfield or that Mata is having to come short to get on the ball. If the ball is played to feet he struggles to do much with it in those areas as well and when he's not there it slows down the progression of the ball as the other team can press us more easily with one less outlet for the defence to pass too.

I said it at half time but I don't think all the blame lies with him. Like with Schweinsteiger constantly pressing high up the pitch it has to be somewhat tactical as you don't see anyone advising them to not do it and you'd be surprised if they were going against the managers wishes and he does nothing about it. 

It's also really frustrating when we just push him up top because the build up play goes with it. I just think that if we actually looked to keep playing, maybe at a quicker pace with more risks and he's used to just get in the box when we're in the right area we'd get more out of him. At the moment it feels like LVG has a warped sense of what he's bringing to the team as least imo. And although I'm not a fan of Fellaini I don't think it can all be blamed on him as it must be a tactical decision in part.

1020~~~
He's not even good enough to break up play to any decent standard.

He reads the game poorly/slowly, he ball-watches, he's not agile or quick on the turn, gives away fouls, isn't strong (he might be able to shove people off the ball, but he's awful at mixing strength with any sort of movement)
And he needs extra touches, so when he <i>does </i>win the ball, he'll never do anything worthwhile or progressive.

He's a target man. He's only good for situations that require standing around being a nuisance, and using little brain. His only use is being hoofed the ball. But teams have been sending their centre backs forward for years, so why even bother with him? He's not even good at heading the ball. 
Nothing against the guy, but let's call a spade a spade. He's out of his depth, and it's not his fault.

1021~~~
Aye, from a footballing perspective, we are currently nowhere near the stature of those clubs. Commercially and size wise (fanbase) for sure we are. We need to get back to that level, and yeah, Fellaini isn't going to be the calibre of player who does that IMO.

It's difficult to for me to hate him, but I actually do, which is irrational. I mean, it's not his fault he's playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. Which footballer could turn that down.

1022~~~
I agree his break up play isn't great but I think he can do a job there. Don't get me wrong he'd be my last choice in the middle ahead of all our other midfielders but if you get a situation like yesterday with the injuries and I presume Carrick on the bench for when/if BFS runs out of steam then I think you've got to make the best of the situation and there Fellaini can do a job helping to keep us solid in the middle, winning the goal kick and getting in the box for set pieces/crosses. Why we feel the need to give him more freedom beyond that, particularly in a game like yesterdays where we had showed that our main threat was running in behind is something I don't understand.

1023~~~
He started off OK. He put in a couple of tackles. Nicked the ball off Wolfsburg players and I started to think that finally we are seeing him in a proper DM role where he could be useful. Then something happened after 10 mins and he went from doing decently in DM to absolutely sucking on the wide left/striker role which he was pretending to be. Who gave him those tactical instructions?

1024~~~
Playing him in a midfield two is the same as chaining a boulder to his midfield partner's neck. He just seems to do what he wants and leaves his partner isolated. With a bit of discipline and understanding, I think Fellaini and Schweinsteiger could have done the job last night. Fellaini has many limitations, but what he is good at is useful. But, it's not useful if he goes launching down the left wing and then loses the ball.

I don't think he fits in to this seasons forward pointing 4-3-3. But then again, I don't think many of our front 6 players do.

1025~~~
Maybe he was told to keep it simple for the first 10 and then push up? Alternatively if he was going against the managers wishes why did no one correct him? I didn't see any of the coaches/players advice him to stay deeper. He didn't become more disciplined in the second half and what he was doing was not unlike what we've seen before from him. It's the same with Schweinsteiger and his pressing that seems out of sync with the team, which was an issue yesterday but most highlighted by the arsenal game. Again if the manager/coaches don't want it or see it as a problem why didn't we see any communication or if there was behind closed doors any noticeable change? LVG doesn't strike me as someone who tolerates players going maverick.

1026~~~
Whenever he plays in midfield, we have no control over the game, and well, no midfield at all. Wanders off post all the time, and compromises the one thing we're good at - keeping the ball. I understand he can be the target man if he goes up, but that's no how we look  to play. He is anti-LVG as a midfielder.

Shouldn't have been in that starting lineup, Carrick would've made of world of difference alongside Basti.

1027~~~
He's not even good enough as a target man. He's surprisingly weak in aerial battles and for a guy of his size, he's losing way too many 50-50's. 

Playing him in midfield was clear suicide. Even Pereira would have been a better choice. There were times yesterday when one Wolfsburg player would go past Schweiny and Fellaini with one or two touches like they weren't even there. Overrun in midfield is putting it mildly.

1028~~~
Very true. Whatever he arguably does offer us in midfield (and I'd personally say it's not really a lot), is just countered by the fact that his positioning and poor reading of the game hinders us massively. He's a very unintelligent footballer, which was a problem when we were up against an intelligent counter-attacking side last night.

1029~~~
He isn't equipped to play in a two-man midfield. We have known this since Moyes' season with us though. He needs the extra protection afforded in a 4-3-3, though tbf most of our midfielders do.

1030~~~
Last season the Carrick/Fellaini/Herrera midfield trio was integral to our success. Fellaini's part in that was as a box-to-box player - he provided energy and a high work rate both going forward and defensively. He linked up well with Blind/Young on the left (which was where most of our best play came from, rather than the Herrera/Mata Spanish love duo on the right). He got into the box to provide a threat from crosses and set pieces, closed down opposition defenders constantly, and always tracked back to defend and make important tackles in our half of the pitch.

I cant really be bothered to debate any further here because the bottom line is that most of this place have had it in for Fellaini since he signed, and <i>nothing</i> he does will ever register for those fans as being acceptable. Some fans are at least honest enough to admit this, whilst the others try to 'objectively' argue that Fellaini is a league two player - despite him showing at Everton and United that this is obviously not the case.

As it stands, it wont surprise me at all if Fellaini is sold in the summer - the 4-2-3-1 formation doesn't suit him (or any of our other midfielders for that matter) and he deserves better than to be a bit part player constantly getting abused by his own teams 'fans'.

1031~~~
Ahhhhh the Rooney procedure you mean <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1032~~~
Integral to our success! You mean getting fourth and that run of three games where we played well? Also that worked well enough for three games before opposition teams sorted that out and we could do squat all after that. I just cannot understand why do you and others point to those three games to somehow justify his contribution. He was decent last season and I agreed but he does not suit the formation or the style we are playing now and he is not good enough or important enough for us to change that style to revolve around his best attributes. I would love for us to play more direct but even then his first touch and his ability on the ball is so limited that he would be as useless then as he is now.

I am not one of those who says he is a league two player, but he is DEFINITELY not a United standard player if we intend to reach where we want to again. What exactly has he shown at United? He has been average and I would be very glad if we get shot.
He maybe deserves to be a starter but no way at a club of United's stature. He won't get a sniff in the Bayern/Madrid/Barca teams. His level was Everton and he won the lottery when Moyes brought him to United.

1033~~~
The thing is though that this isn't at all true. I've been a massive critic of Fellaini while here, but I'll happily admit that he was actually quite decent last season at times, and had a very good spell for us where he genuinely looked like an excellent box-to-box midfielder.

The problem was that it's mostly been a limited to a decent spell, and was arguably our most impressive spell in the entire Moyes/LVG era. I won't dispute that Fellaini played well. What's also certain though is that he was benefiting from playing in a side that managed to play some good football: he was in with a performing Carrick and Herrera, for example. His good spell for us was mostly limited to one period, and it's not good enough if he wants to remain. Cleverley had a good spell for us. Anderson did too. He needs to show a lot more if he wants to remain here, and a spell of good football in a performing side isn't good enough. What impact is he making when we're struggling? He's the type of player who, with his stature and very different style, surely <i>should </i>be an impact player of some kind.

Again, if Fellaini can't adapt at all to a 4-2-3-1, then that's his problem, and not ours. I understand that players have preferred roles in which they'll thrive, but it's not too much for us to ask for Fellaini to adapt from one midfield role to another and not look a bit rubbish in the process of doing so. It's not as if he spent the entirety of his Everton career on the tip of a 4-3-3 formation, for example.

In addition to that, he's not really being <i>abused</i>, by our fans, which is a ridiculously melodramatic term to use. He's just being heavily criticised because he's playing poorly. And that's fair enough. There's no agenda against him. No determination to prove him as being terrible. No conspiracy. No ulterior motives. People just think he's a bit shite considering the standard we should be looking at, and he continues to vindicate us.

1034~~~
Try the Valencia thread last season.

Fellaini wasn't that great last night, but as an attacking force, he gave us something extra. Especially with the quality of Blind's deliveries, that was something we could use to our advantage, and we almost did last night.

You are fighting a lone crusade war that you wont win though. Whether he has a good game or not, some people wont give him the time of day.

1035~~~
I agree he does not suit the current system. But the fact that Fellaini did well for us last season <i>should</i> provide some proof that he is clearly capable of playing at this level.

Moyes buying him was a mistake because he was not what we needed at the time. However, Fellaini showed at Everton and last season at United that he is capable of dominating the match against the top teams in the league. Last year he was one of our best performers in the big games, consistently. This season the system has been changed and there is no longer a really a role/place in the team that suits him, and for that reason I think he should be sold. However preferable to that would be simply reverting to the 4-3-3 which served us well last season.

1036~~~
Who's had the bigger mare?  Fellaini this season or <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> in this thread.  Show me a midfielder who doesn't play better in a midfield trio. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1037~~~
The irony of people calling him "bogbrush" When he's absolutely toilet

1038~~~
At least Walrus is consistent. More than can be said about Fellaini <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1039~~~
He's only useful if his responsibilities are forwards facing. I genuinely didn't realise how terrible he is in his own half when we bought him. He can't tackle, he can't keep up with runners and he's somehow weak in possession despite having elbows of fury. 

If we stick him in the oppositions half, near their final third he causes problems. That's it. That's his only use now. 

And our XI can't sustain a player that is such a luxury.

1040~~~
Absolutely.
As for the bit about him being "somehow weak in possession despite having elbows of fury" - it's because he's the useless kind of strong. He's 'strong' when it comes to standing his ground and waiting for a hoofed ball to reach him.

But the kind of strength that football requires much more is the strength that one shows when turning, dribbling, running, moving. He's flimsy as anything with a high centre of gravity.

It also doesn't help that his technique is average, which means that he has to do everything technical with loads of care. So, for example, when he goes to control a dropping ball, he's so focused on getting the control right (because he's not a natural) that he pretty much neglects using his body effectively. Which is why he always looks a second away from being dispossessed.

Similar to Carroll; only actually looks 'strong' when he's standing still, waiting for a long ball.

1041~~~
He's a 'hit or miss' midfielder. Not good enough for a club like Manchester United. Not his fault though. 

Thought he was okay last night but Herrera would have improved us ten-fold going forward.

1042~~~
I thought Louis found his strengths last season when he used him in the inside left channel to pop up at the far post and isolate himself against the fullback to win headers. He wrecked havoc playing that role and even his all round game looked pretty good. Remember the through ball from Carrick he latched onto that started our run in the game against Spurs?

All of a sudden its like we are back to square one, asking him to play deeper, collect the ball from defense and appear all over the place. Its not his fault that the manager seems lost with him tactically. This is my issue with Louis, he solved a lot of problems towards the end of last season, increased our tempo, made our attack look very fluent until we lost all our key players ahead of the Chelsea game and ran out of steam. Now we start a new season with no continuity and going up against the same problems that appeared resolved before.

1043~~~
I think that ship has sailed as he doesn't seem to be that of a weapon near or in the opposition box anymore like last season. Of course this was to be expected as we are one dimentional when we're losing and hoofing it always to him, so the defenders can anticipate better and get into better positions.

His only use is behind the striker or even as a striker and keep him somewhere in defence. In midfield he is a plastic bag in the wind with a touch of a rapist..

1044~~~
If we were to play 4-3-3, there are players better than him in every position that he could play in. He should be sold so that he can play regularly elsewhere and we can get a proper mid/#10 who is actually at the level to be a starter for United.

1045~~~
Agreed. On a good day against an opposition that can't nullify him he can go to town (as he did against us in fact) Severely limited skillset though so he's bound to struggle if not allowed to play to his strengths.

He's a mid table player simple as.

1046~~~
Never a United player, I get frustrated just knowing he's at our club.

1047~~~
I think after the Chelsea game, things changed when teams started to man mark him more tightly. I think we were playing 4,3,3 at the time. He was very good at pressing the opposition fullback allowing our fullbacks to bomb on. The problem is, Fellani is not the most mobile player in the world and all it takes is 1 of the 2 protecting the back 4 to stay close to him and intercept passes into him. You could also argue that Carricks injury meant those long ground passes that bypass the midfielders and gave him that yard to turn and get it to the full backs was a domino effect on the influence he was having in games.

1048~~~
If someone feels the need to man mark Fellaini, that's already a big tactical win. Most of the long balls into him were coming from Blind who was playing left back.

1049~~~
not only getting forward, he would help basti to control the game

1050~~~
He has been man marked once, no one else has seen the need to do it, all anyone needs to do is compete physically and you will probably stop him. Two or three times a season he will come against someone he can bully and on those days he will be unplayable but most of the time he is ineffective.

1051~~~
This was roughly my take on it last season - the fact that teams started setting out to stop Fellaini was proof of his value. The fact that stopping Fellaini nullified our attack for the most part was proof that we were reliant on him (which isnt a good thing) and that the other players were not pulling their weight.

1052~~~
Yeah, Mourinho felt the need to play an additional center back in midfield to cope with him. That's the kind of paranoia he created for the opposition on the back of 4 games. With some luck in terms of injuries we could have exploited that more by dragging teams out of shape and that right sided trio of Mata/Herrera and Valencia would have benefited from it.

1053~~~
His movement yesterday was absolutely criminal, his attitude and chasing back was absolutely embarrassing for a Manchester United player playing game of the season for his team. How many times Mata who is apparently luxury player outrun him running back to the defence helping out even though he was far higher on the pitch while this idiot just stayed on his left side on centre of the pitch like he is on vocation was painful to watch. I am seriously thinking of making video of his shameful behaviour yesterday(but I am lazy and have more important things to do, but I hope someone could do it).

1054~~~
Everyone else since then has nullified him without man marking him, it's quite clear he was so useless teams felt no need to have any plan to deal with him, he had three really good games out of nowhere last season so that changed. Since then teams have stopped him by just competing with him, he doesn't bully anyone and has been a waste of space most of the time, he finished last season playing poorly and hasn't recovered since.

1055~~~
lost the ability to do the simple things he does best. Chest control, winning headers and knocking them down.

1056~~~
This is my gripe with him. When he's not up to it, he looks a right lazy bastard.

1057~~~
So my suggestion to sell him next summer wasn't far-fetched at all...He's another one who has been used wrongly so far this season though.

1058~~~
Hope he leaves so I don't have to read all the fecking bullshit on anything he does in the matchday thread.

1059~~~
Does anyone know where the hell he's playing today?

I include him in that.

1060~~~
He can score 5 goals but he is absolutely not a fecking central midfielder. Only Martial, de Gea and Lingard(who was subbed off) made less passes than him in this half, and we are talking about actual midfielder here.

Wide players aren't seeing quality balls because of him, Mata and Martial are hardly seeing any ball because of him, there is simply no players to connect Carrick and other attacking players because he is most forward than our actual forwards. I seriously can't believe how he can play like this and stay in the team. Carrick is controlling the midfield all by himself. And Fellaini started ahead of Carrick against Wolsfurg.

We are playing great considering we have central midfielder who is staying more forward than our forwards.

1061~~~
As soon as I saw your name on this thread I though you might say something like that. I've stopped trying - a lot of fans quite simply have it in for him.

1062~~~
The same position as against Wolfsburg?

Which is to say no idea whatsoever. 

He's hopeless.

1063~~~
It's borderline obssession, tiresome load of shit and reluctance to give him any praise makes some look like a bunch of kids.

1064~~~
People would rather kill themselves than praise Fellaini. He needs to play every game because he makes things happen. Couldn't care less if he looks awkward or stamps everything in sight.

1065~~~
Why are people blaming him for pushing up so high? He's clearly been ordered to.

1066~~~
What things are those exactly? He is invisible.

1067~~~
He's part of the reason Carrick is getting plenty of time to pick his passes. 

Did his bit so far. He does however look like the weak link when some of the youngsters and Mata have tried to rack up some nice quick passing in the opposition half.

1068~~~
He is arguably the opposite to Mata in that regard - someone who is very aesthetically pleasing but doesn't actually tend to have any impact or influence on games consistently.

1069~~~
Swap him for pereira in cm and get young in his place in left wing

1070~~~
Chances. He's a distraction to the opponents. Was also one of our best players in loads of big games last season.

He's freak but he's a very effective freak.

1071~~~
If we weren't so injured, he wouldn't be starting. He is what he, a bench player/Plan B. In that role, he is fine IMO. Yes, our build-up is worse off but he doesn't shy away from trying to make things happen and didn't deserve all the hate he gets

1072~~~
Absolutely. It's like people have forgotten how well he played last season.

1073~~~
He's been the same every time United have played him in midfield. It's his only strength because he cannot play a central midfield role at all.

1074~~~
And it resulted in a goal. If he doesn't do that, nobody does, and it's still 1-0.

Gets us back in the game, and people still want him off.

1075~~~
What chances, in the last 5 premierleague games he played part we scored total of 0 goals.

1076~~~
Doing well.

1077~~~
Fellaini influences our games? How exactly? Mata actually scored decent mumber of goals and assisted few goals too. Fellaini had one assist so far in the season.

1078~~~
Oh right,  did not realize that Fellaini was to blame for our 0-0s.

1079~~~
So? Remind me who created the chance for Martial through a route one pass against West Ham?

He makes things happen simply by standing in the opposition area. He's also nowhere near his best this season due to not playing regularly. Stick him in that #10 role regularly and ruffle a few feathers. That seems our only option atm.

1080~~~
He has gotten into some good positions so far in the opponents box, causing general havoc. Obviously this will be met with unbridled criticism that he is pushing forward too much...

1081~~~
Madness to take him off.

1082~~~
Honestly at this rate I'm struggling to think of anyone else who deserves MotM for any reason. Fellaini scored our only goal (so far) and has generally caused havoc.

1083~~~
Well, Carrick

1084~~~
I'm delighted with the swift one touch football we are playing without him. Look at all the control of the midfield we've gained, all those beautiful goals, Pereira who's constantly blocked by him ia wreaking havoc amongst their ranks. All the shots we've had since he left. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1085~~~
True enough, Carrick has looked decent.

1086~~~
Yeah, expecting us to improve with Powell replacing him says a lot about Fellaini actually.

1087~~~
But Fellaini is the reason why we looked so shit though, our front players can't play football with him, all we do is hoofball, if other players had his chances we'd be 10bup, etc., so what's up?

1088~~~
That and few other things. 

But he is shit, yes, one of our worst players today. Our keeper made just 6 less passes than him, and he is apparently our central midfielder. Great stuff. And look at the goals we scored against team that conceedes the most in league with our big Fella ocuppying the defenders.

1089~~~
This is absolutely nonsense, by the way.

1090~~~
He's an embarrassment. Yes, he scored, but we shouldn't be relying on this lump.

1091~~~
The most ridiculous substitution under Van Gaal. Our most dangerous player. He wasn't pretty to watch but he was causing problems, more than anyone else. He went off, we didn't cause a single problem again. Absolute madness. I'm neither here nor there with Fellaini. I don't like him but I don't think he's the embarrassing clogger many others do, but he had to stay on today. He just had to. Lunacy.

1092~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Our worst player! Stop embarrassing yourself. You do that well enough in other threads.

quite clearly our most dangerous player and by some distance.

1093~~~
He's shit.

When the Bournemouth player broke free and they won the corner from which they scored from, instead of Fellaini stepping in to block his path when he was running forward, he steps to the left to block an imaginary pass and lets the bournmoth player have a free run towards goal.

How anyone actually believes that this fecking tool is a defensive midfielder is beyond me, madness, just madness

1094~~~
You see that is exactly what worries me so much.

1095~~~
Probably but that's not his fault is it? We're not shit because of Fellaini despite what some people might think.

1096~~~
Plays well. Basically has all our shots. Gets subbed. Genius LVG.

1097~~~
It's not his fault, I don't think this season he has even been utilized correctly.

1098~~~
Scores the goal, has over half our shots with McNair having the most after him and he is our worst player today? Jaysus lads, at least make it believable.

1099~~~
Quite rich response given that he scored and looked the only player that would score today. If I was as deluded and hell bent on spouting utter bullshit as his stalwart opponents I'd say that he's just surrounded by terrible players and therefore he doesn't score, line of defense alike to what our ex players claim about Rooney.

As for other responses, no, he's not a defensive midfielder, nobody says he is, just because LVG plays him there it doesn't make him one. We should revert to 4141 with two 8s we played last season but we won't do it.

1100~~~
He's an easy scapegoat because of his clumsiness but he's not worse than the rest.

1101~~~
who cares that fellaini looked decent and carrick as well, their output together is horrible, we couldnt control the game, thats why some of our attacking palyers are suffering, thats why we were so fecking shaky in defense, B'mouth could score 4 or 5, thats why you need schneiderlin and we couldnt make use of mata and the three at the top properly, it all wee just hit and miss attacking moves, there is no real tactics in it because of the desrupted midfield, with Herrera coming back it will be much better, I wouldnt mind keeping Fella on the pitch today, only for mata to go down and pereira to midfield

1102~~~
He was grand today.

1103~~~
Stupid to take him off. Thought he played pretty shit and the goal was just pretty much forcing it in, but if there's a situation you want him in for, is chasing it like we were with so many players out. He's not a midfielder. He's a target man, always has been, and is only good when used like that.

1104~~~
Perhaps people who want to discuss his performances who reside in a topic related to his performances. If you want to complain and throw shit excuses about why our inept Matas, Depays, Pereiras and Martials couldn't do shit today there are actually plenty of other topics related.

We took him off, they all still looked fecking shit, so what was the reason then? Post traumatic Fellaini disorder everybody else suffered from afterwards?

1105~~~
He was shit but still one of our better players and our goalscorer. Work that one out.

Can't get past the fact if he wasn't 7ft tall he wouldnt be near the club, yet he doesn't even use his physique intellgently enough.

1106~~~
If De Gea was lame he wouldn't be at the club either but there you go

1107~~~
Was dangerous today and playing well, so of course LVG is not tolerating that. Back to the bench.

1108~~~
If De gea was shorter he would still have enough ability to add to the team, unlike Marouane.

1109~~~
Utilized correctly....<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>...

He doesn't fit in anywhere...He's miserable..How we ended up paying that much for such a shit football player..

1110~~~
OMG, chill out..

If you had a closer look to how actually football works, would be nice actually, its a team game and its obvious that our far biggest weakeness is midfield right now, not the young defense but midfield, thats why we got knocked out of champions league the other night... surely the individual performance wasnt the worst by the two but as a team it didnt work at all, you just need to do a bit of analyzing .-)

 I am not smashing fellaini for his performance, I am just stating it doesnt work like this with them on the pitch, after he got subbed off we sent on Nick powell who got one touch, we went all in, there was no order, thats just normal in this stage and state of the game.. you dont send a player on who didnt play football for one year to play striker and shuffle players and start to think that everything will work out well..

It was only 10 minutes to the game and we started to lose control of the game.. think of it as a whole

1111~~~
I like him still, my mother watching said 'he always seem to pop up in the box' and she hit the nail on the head for me. Always get in there and could have got rewarded a few times today if Bournemouth hadn't of done so well in those situations. 

Not sure about him in a midfield 2 tho, never was, looked great in a 3 last year

1112~~~
A lot of patronising bullshit that I don't really need but thank you.

1113~~~
When he's on the pitch there is purpose to our attacking moves. Yeah it may not be aesthetically pleasing but give me him than guys like Mata who flatter to deceive.

1114~~~
Also I loved his little cruyff turn immediately before he came off.

1115~~~
Probably his best game this season, tried to take up the slack in attack but left Carrick isolated too often, ludicrous to take him off though, Mata should have come off for Schneiderlin and just let Fellaini keep high up the pitch.

1116~~~
He is a useful player to gave in the squad. He seems to get blamed for everything.

1117~~~
With Fellaini playing two games in a row in midfield we conceeded 5 goals. Second goal/corner would never happen if he just moved 3 meters to the left to intercept their runner, but he was lazy and instead Martial chased him through entire feild and Fellaini just watched him get past him. Few players were shouting at him after the move but I guess somehow it wasn't his fault. Apart from that, he is nowhere to be found in defence in last two games, with Carrick and Schweinsteiger being one man midfield in both games. So, he's shite defensively.

This is his "defending" before they won a corner for the second goal:
*



Carrick had 65 passes today, and his partner in midfield- Fellaini, had just 29. De Gea had 23, just 6 less passes than Manchester United central midfielder! Depay tried 37, 8 more passes than Fellaini. Basically, only de Gea, Martial and Perreira made less passes than him, and somehow people are saying our defence is shit, we can't control the game but yet are happy with Fellaini playing cm. So, he doesn't help us control the game, at all. If anything, we lose the control because of him.

As for the attack, apparently his strongest weapon, I heard we create chances with him on the pitch but yet we scored one goal today against the team that conceeds most goals in the league, two goals per game on average. Only chances are coming through him because that's the only way we can create something in opposition box when he is playing as a central midfielder, of course it will always be him because he spends most time in opposition box while our other players are actually involved in the build up, and spend a lot of time helping out our defence, because he doesn't do that, at all. When he is on the pitch our entire tactics are hoofing the ball to him in the box, so of course something will come out of him.
In his last 5 appearances in PL before today we haven't scored single goal, but yet somehow "we create chances with him on the pitch". Actually, in his entire PL campaign this year, we scored just today with him on the pitch, and 3 goals against Liverpool. That's just 4 goals with him on the pitch. He scored just one.
In CL he has 1 assist, so in total in PL and CL he played around 570 minutes and scored one goal and made one assist.

Why exactly he deserves to be on the pitch, at all? Can someone give me one valid reason apart from "he makes something happen" because quite obviously he doesn't, if that's true he would be scoring goals or our team would be scoring more with him on the pitch, and we aren't. Instead we are pretty much the same in attack, but at the same time we don't have any control of the game at all, and our defensive play is terrible when he is playing in midfield because his defensive play is non-existent.

<span style="font-size: 12px">* I know the pics aren't the greatest quality, but they can prove a point.</span>

1118~~~
<a class="username" data-user="54956, @Amar__" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54956/">@Amar__</a> your images dont work for a start, but generally freeze frames arent usually as concrete and conclusive as you might think for proving a point.

Regarding what Fellaini contributed today, it should be obvious - he got into the Bournemouth box frequently and got into good positions to shoot and create chances. He scored our only goal and could have had several more if not for good defending, blocking and goalkeeping by the opposition.

The thing you - and several other posters - dont seem to get is that Fellaini is quite obviously not just a typical central midfielder, and therefore it is fairly pointless to measure him as one. He has a particular skillset which is pretty well agreed upon, so why dont you judge him on how he performs within that skillset, rather than complaining because he isnt a different player?
Going on today's match, Fellaini was clearly playing a more advanced box to box role than Carrick, who was the primary holding midfielder. I think it is reasonable to assume that this is as per LVG's instructions, and not just something Fellaini decided to do by himself - especially since he had games last season in a more dedicated defensive role (such as man marking Fabregas against Chelsea, a game in which he won MotM) he was able to perform this role.

Basically Fellaini is in a no-win situation with people like you. You complain and criticise him for 'abandoning' Carrick in midfield, and yet it was because of this that he was able to create several chances, score our only goal and have several other shots which on another day could have gone in. On the other hand, if he had stayed back alongside Carrick for the entire game, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he would be criticised for <b>not</b> getting forward, using his physicality, playing to his strengths etc etc.

The bottom line and answer to your question is the same thing I have already said twice in this post - Fellaini scored our only goal and could have had more. This is more than Martial, Mata, Memphis, Lingard or Pereira managed over the game. Following the matchday thread it was actually highly amusing to watch the hordes of posters angrily berating Fellaini for most of the first half, and then complaining so vociferously when he was substituted - I was glad for the entertainment since I certainly didnt get it for the match, even after the root-of-all-evil Fellaini was taken off (and by the way, we were worse after he came off).

1119~~~
Can't believe you are one of the few here who understands what's going on with fellaini in midfield. In ideal world I wouldn't start him at all but he would be defo much more useful as CAM in a team with a good midfield, which can control the game and actually run, he showed that in short spells last season when we had Carrick in a good form along with Herrera, he was very good even with Rooney up top.. that's his position but he's absolutely terrible defensively and mobility wise, his attacking contribution is also speculative but having Marouane Fellaini now in midfield doesnt mean any better attack and much weaker defense. And that' shocking to see as someone like Van Gaal always proclaimed how his balance is important.. there is absolutely no balance there right now..

1120~~~
And with that kind if tactics that suit Fellaini we didn't create enough chances, didn't control the game and defended badly, so it was obviously wrong tactics to use from the start, which means that we shouldn't have used him un a way we did.

Everyone was complaining because it actually makes sense to play that kind of football when you spend all your other ideas and have no much time left, so most teams will obviously hoof the ball and having someone like Fellaini to jump is useful in dying minutes when the oppositiin is defending deep on their box. There is also that argument that having Powell on the pitch doesn't bring anything useful at all.

Btw pictures are working for me. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1121~~~
Nail on head. His alleged aerial threat is the biggest myth in football. 
He's crap and brings everyone else's performance down a notch by their insistent urge to hoof it to him. 
A clumsy, red-card liability. Even his goal looked like someone felling a particularly odd looking tree!
Has no place at Utd and is a glaring statement of what we've become. How anyone thinks this is acceptable in Utd's centre mid and genuinely thinks we can compete in the PL & especially CL against the top teams, is beyond me.

1122~~~
He'll never be United sexy, but he does give.

1123~~~
Schweinsteiger did that against Wolfsburg midweek too.

Anyway, he was our best player. Not sure why he was taken off? He was our only threat and should be playing as the #10 until Herrera is back (unless we revert back to the formation we used last season - which we should). People can spout all the nonsense they want but he was more effective than any other player on the pitch. He is clearly ordered to push up the field too, otherwise he would not be starting.

1124~~~
I'm inclined to agree with this. If we're going to play him, play him in a role with less defensive responsibility. Possibly more difficult today, but if Jones and Schneid were on the bench, we can assume they could manage 45 each.

1125~~~
You can start with watching yesterday's game. If you do Fellaini's level of threat going forward should be blatantly obvious and that's aside from the fact that he scored our only goal. It should also be apparent how toothless we looked once he went off. If you can <i>still </i>come back and say Fellaini was the worst player in the team with a straight face, then we can all admit you have no clue what you're talking about and move on.

Of course, we can also blame poo 'ol Nick Powell since without him and Fellaini we've been playing free flowing football while creating chances left, right and centre.

1126~~~
For me he can score in every game and I'll still consider him shite.

If he is our best offensive output, we are fecked. Sooner he goes the better.

1127~~~
That perfectly encapsulates the bias attitude people have toward him. Even if he is a success people will criticise him. He's in a no-win situation.

1128~~~
Indeed, but he hasn't been. 

Can't fault me for providing an honest assessment.

1129~~~
But you said even if he was a success (scoring every game) you would still think he was shite. I wasn't arguing whether or not he has been a success. There are people here who hold preconceived ideas about him and they won't change even if he does perform. It's sad.

1130~~~
If you think him being a sort of nuisance in the opposition penalty box is all it takes to be considered a threat as a United player, then our standards and expectations have truly hit rock bottom. He could be a good tool to get at the end of crosses but it is not like we were creating chances or playing great football when he was on the pitch. The chances that fell to him were from rebounds or poor clearances. For a big man, he loses so many aerial duels. Also we don't need a target man or a big lumbering player up top for us to have a good return from crosses. Our poor play was for all to see even with him on the pitch. Obviously replacing him with Powell was a blantantly stupid decision but that does not mean he was good. He toepoked a chance in and fair dues but why let go of someone like Hernandez if bundling 1 out of 4 chances from inside the penalty box is what we need.

1131~~~
So you are admitting to being an irrational idiot because thinking like that clearly isn't rational at all.

1132~~~
So we should revert back to our attacking play where we barely had a shot on goal and barely looked like scoring because that would indicate a rise in standards?

Don't get pointless posts like these. It's not Fellaini's faults everyone else is shite thus making him look good (If that is indeed the case). We're in no position to be looking down at players who look reasonably threatening going forward even if it means pumping long balls into the air. It's not like our football has been scintillating before we played him.

1133~~~
Our football is still the same with him on the field. The fact that we created 3-4 chances in the first half and he was involved in the rebounds in a couple of them does not mean he was actually better than the rest. Again he was not the worst player out there but he was not someone I would not think of subbing off either. The very reason I wanted him out despite his decent last season was because the only way he would be useful in an attacking sense is if we pump long balls or crosses to him. Not something I am a fan of and will never actually get used to us using those tactics as our primary way to score goals.

However I will concede taking him off for Powell was as maddening as taking Mata off for Powell against Wolfsburg. A senseless sub which looks as bad in hindsight as it did when that sub was made.

1134~~~
Was our biggest threat yesterday. Made his substitution absolutely incredible. I really get the feeling some of van Gaal's subs are predetermined and not based on the actual game. I hope I'm wrong.

1135~~~
So nobody, even not Fellaini, picked up a central defender running with the ball but it's purely Fellaini's fault. If you weren't full of shit, mindless bias that you already displayed several times in this topic you'd probably make it out that our tactics are fecking dumb and our players themselves don't know what to do. You'd figure it out if you watched United play this season, with or without Fellaini.

1) It is shit, but it would be strange if it wasn't when we're playing a makeshift of defence at it with all Shaw, Rojo, Jones, Smalling and Darmian injured.
2) Nobody is happy with Fellaini playing as second #6, you wouldn't write such bullshit if you actually bothered to read this thread at times instead of throwing looped boring cliches. I take it you weren't happy with him last season as well when he was scoring against likes of City, Tottenham or bossing the games as second #8 in 4141? Or we were bossing those games <b>despite</b> him?

Those shit excuses would actually make sense if we weren't abysmal in attack with or without him, failing to score in like 5 out of 10 games and winning just 4 out of last what, 12 or 13 games? We didn't hoof it to him yesterday either but yea, you're seeing what you want to see, yet again. We've all seen how much of a hampering link he is when he went off, all the beautiful, full flow football we've witnessed. Oh wait, we didn't create shit again.

Because today he was probably the only player that actually looked like he wanted to score, same can't be said about our other attacking players. Even if he's not involved himself assists/goals wise, he'll drag somebody with him because for some reason they are always picking him up, that's why he's so far up the pitch, that's an element of a tactic that was used last season as well and not him going AWOL, you'd probably know that if you weren't biased, again.

And again, attributing all of our 'terrible defensive play' to him because he's in midfield (he shouldn't be playing as second #6, mind) is fecking hilarious, that's completely ignoring our defensive crisis we're going through (which has been easy to predict, but that's for another topic). If we're the same, then why shouldn't he be on the pitch? Why is Mata more deserving? Is Pereira more deserving? Lingard? Is there any argument bar being 'younger' for some of them? Or is it just yours 'i don't like him therefore he shouldn't play' bullshit? Guess we both know the answer.

To be fair it's even pretty hilarious how you don't bother to think about those 5 goals we've lost in those two games, desperately trying to make it sound like it's his fault. We've lost 4 out of those 5 from corners if I recall correctly. In Wolfsburg, i.a., Smalling didn't pick Naldo for the first goal, somebody didn't pick Naldo again for the second. In this game, guy scores directly from a fecking corner that DDG should've cleared and then Blind doesn't pick his man. But yea, we've got no control, it's Fellaini's fault. Christ almighty.

And the pictures don't work.

1136~~~
On the contrary I feel he sometimes takes off the most likely players to create chances in order to bring in some flavor of the month youth team player to try and massage his ego if we then win.

1137~~~
Exactly. Rather an ugly(for the want of a better word) and more direct threat like him than none at all. It's the same with Ashley Young. Absolutely irritating how some go on about him not being "United level anyways" when he's done better than most. 

By all mean, bench them or sell them once we have a better way to go about things. Till then, let them be. Putting Powell as the CF and relegating Martial to the right killed the game for us.

1138~~~
Will get him sacked. How's that for an ego massage <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1139~~~
It actually does say exactly that. He also scored a goal. He creates problems for the opposition through being a awkward bastard and brings a new (read only) kind of attacking threat to our play.

This guy and Young should be starting games. Without the two of them Van Gaal would have been sacked last season.

1140~~~
Don't know about being sacked but don't think we'd be in the top 4.

1141~~~
I don't agree. If all players are fit, Fellaini should not be in our first 11. Herrera should always be ahead of him. Fellaini hardly plays as a CM. Herrera would have brought better balance to our play than Fellaini. Nonetheless with our current injury crisis it is a no brainer.

1142~~~
Same thing imo. Finishing outside the top 4 after spunking 150m is a good way to get sacked.

Herrera wide right, Fellaini as #10, Young wide left and Martial up top. That's the way forward. Everyone else can feck off.

1143~~~
I don't care how good or bad the player is in essence. If Utd comes calling, no player is going to say I don't think I'm good enough to sign so no thanks. It's our recruitment therefore should be in question. He is what he is and if used effective can influence football matches, in fact his form the back of the season actual contributed to us securing the CL place. I think the issues are clearly deeper than individual abilities or performances and even when we were winning everything, take a look at Utd squad was everyone there Utd quality?

1144~~~
Define perform. If performing as our main outlet in a team devoid of any free flowing or cohesive football is your definition then so be it, I suppose we have different conceptions of performance. 

Are you serious? There is more to a player than just scoring goals, especially when the player disrupts the teams rhythm and tempo, or even lowers its quality. Perhaps your criteria of rationality is rather flawed. If Marouane Fellaini is Manchester United's best offensive output, there is something wrong. Surely that is not irrational at all. 

I'm sure you can string a sentence together without any name calling.

1145~~~
That worked for like three games last season. No way will we get anywhere with that.

1146~~~
This. 

People who blindly defend Fellaini after his one half-decent performance in every 15 games, in a team made of of emergency drafted youth team players, in a defeat, to Bournemouth.... They need to step back and watch a re-run of Utd of old or a different team & see how proper strikers/midfielder operate. 

Anyone that thinks Fellaini is good enough for Utd has been desensitised by Moyes and LVG. Fellaini wouldn't have got anywhere near a Utd team of the past 25yrs & would be nowhere near any top European teams today.

He's the benchmark of where some fans expectations have fallen to and a damning indictment of the current level of the squad on which LVG has squandered millions.

1147~~~
Yup, I'll look back at our last title run and see how Tom fecking Cleverley operated or our fat clown who now fails to deliver in Brazil operated. Breathtaking experience that. Now that's some quality.

1148~~~
Give me the 4-3-3 we played last year. Carrick or Schneiderlin holding, Herrera and Fellaini in front as #8s, Martial up front, Memphis and Young on the wings.

1149~~~
Got slaughtered in the match day thread but voted MOTM.Go figure.

1150~~~
fellaini wouldn't have got near that fergie team. He just tore it to shreds whenever we played vs him

1151~~~
They were bags of shit too, just frustrating that Moyes took more sub-par players on. Let's not forget LVG had Fellaini in the shop window in the summer, but now due to his own managerial shortcomings, he's relying on the tall Evertonian. Again, a symbol of how far we've fallen.

1152~~~
Moyes managed that team that 'tore it to shreds'.... Doesn't mean he was Man Utd quality, history has shown that and it will show the same about Fellaini.

1153~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf4oUzNEQ6E?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

His best performance for us this season IMO.

1154~~~
I think people who don't think he's a sueful option are nuts. People are obsessed with the 'embarrassment' of it. I don't get it. Mourinho won the CL with a similar target man at inter milan, and last year with that strategy we battered pool city and spurs on the bounce. It is a credible plan B whether it offends you or not

1155~~~
Wut.. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1156~~~
Yes, but given that we used to win the title with worse players/midfielder it means that it's merely the players' fault (or in particular one player's fault). Merely manager's ineptitude as shown.

1157~~~
If you're scoring a goal a game then there really isn't, goals win games and scoring one a game instantly makes you one of the greatest players ever. See that isn't rational at all, there is nothing wrong with Fellaini or anyone being the best offensive output, as long as they are producing and scoring a goal a game would be extraordinary output, that is irrational personal hatred on your side. How would it be wrong for someone who scores every single game to be the best offensive output? How could someone who breaks records and is instantly the greatest goalscorer to ever grace the Premier League be shite? So, yes that is clearly irrational and no one in they're right mind would think scoring every game makes you shit. Some of the greatest strikers ever built their games around scoring and not offering much else and they still weren't scoring a goal a game. It was an idiotic statement and it deserved to be called out on.

1158~~~
Diego Targeti Milito.

1159~~~
Ok, I get it now. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1160~~~
The "wut" is still very pertinent though because Milito is everything but a target man, he isn't tall nor powerful.

1161~~~
What a lot of old bollocks. He's one great game against as a centre forward against Michael Carrick at centre back. He's never been a midfielder.

1162~~~
Yep, I still don't get his comparison to be honest mate. Milito was more of a discount version of Batistuta in terms of being a #9, but he was a proper clinical striker and a good one at that - evidenced by his record at Genoa, Zaragoza and early on at Internazionale when he was fit. And he didn't even have any special physical attributes in terms of being a target but he was a very effective and cunning goalscorer in the mid to late 2000s. As for Fellaini, he is.. is.. err I dunno what he is actually. A deadbeat hobo's version of Gullit maybe?

1163~~~
were you not at the 4-4? He ruined us and was unplayable that day

1164~~~
Like Tim Cahill used to do in the same role.

1165~~~
Not as much to us though. Fellaini was always very hard for us to deal with.

Probably wasn't the answer to buy him though!

1166~~~
haha true

1167~~~
He had some joy for part of the game as a forward. At no time has Fellaini ever destroyed our midfield. It isn't something he's capable of. Every attribute he has is that of a target man.

1168~~~
I don't remember specifying what area he destroyed. But having said that I don't remember anyone being able to deal with him that day.
In the end we'd just let him bring the ball down and not even compete.

If only Evra's header had gone in at 4-2 up!

1169~~~
It all stemmed from him supposedly destroying us according to a post in defence of him as a midfielder. Jelavic was giving us bigger problems and he's shite too.

1170~~~
Always ? The one "infamous" match where he was unplayable was when he drifted between midfield and defence and no one tracked him. Which meant that he either kept dragging a midfielder or defender out of position.

The next time we played Everton a certain Cleverley and Anderson duo ran circles around him.

Morten Gamst Pedersen had a couple of decent matches against us for Blackburn...

1171~~~
the 4-4 and he scored the winner in a 1-0. That's just 2 games I'm quoting from memory now. Will be plenty of others.

1172~~~
I saw that, thought it was funny.

1173~~~
He was good yesterday, and was our biggest goal threat, which is why I, along with others, were confused he was taken off. I'd still like him in the position he played in at the back end of last season, though.

1174~~~
Would scoring in every game be 'performing' in your opinion? I would consider that to be performing. Yet even if he did that you would think he is shite. Would he have to score a hat-trick, make 30 clearances, 4 assists and win 50 headers every game for him to 'perform' in your opinion? Would you not think he was shite then?

1175~~~
Useless. I couldn't care less if he scored. He's mid table type player more suitable for a mid table club (which based on our last few games we're not far off from becoming...)

1176~~~
At best clumsy but his consistency of acquiring stupid cards for petty offences is as tedious as his stupid denials. He misses more chances than he takes and at Bournemouth was often slow in attacking loose balls in the box. A Moyes type player which is why we ended up with him and Arsenal got a world class midfielder.

1177~~~
A long winded post about strictly hypothetical scenarios, yet he calls me the idiot? Interesting. 

Perhaps if we focus on the times he played (particularly the times he scores goals) and think "Is that the type of player we need at Manchester United?" You could understand my post a little bit more. The issue I am trying to convey is that even the games he scores goals for us, he has never really turned heads with his performances. He stands out because we play dire football, is that what you want?

It certainly would!
But he hasn't done that, using the term 'performance' is said in the context of the way he has played for us since he arrived. Even at his best 'performances' he was still shite. How is that so hard to grasp? Why get into hypotheticals when you can clearly judge him off his performances, NONE of which have been United quality.

1178~~~
Had a great year last year as he was utilised very well. That's what he needs to succeed, have the play built around him. However Manchester united should never ever build a team around fellaini.

He's big and powerful, gets the odd goal and tries hard. That's all he has, poor passing and is quite slow are 2 of his main weak areas. 

He's not an awful player but he isn't a great player either.

1179~~~
he can do very little with the ball..a very very limited player. what hes doing at united i do not know.

1180~~~
No idea why he was taken off on Saturday he was the only one who really had chances on goal.

1181~~~
Goal was his fault. 

AWOL as usual.

1182~~~
What is his role? What is he offering us in it? 

Defensively he's appalling. Easily drawn to the ball, one pass and he's not only too slow to intercept, but it clears a huge space in front of the back 4. 

Offensively he's in completely impotent areas. He gets the ball 40 yards from goal on the left side. He can't dribble, pass or cross, so what's the  f*cking point? 

It's like playing with 10 men. I don't blame him, presumably he's sticking rigidly to the tactics LVG has sent him out with, but it's a joke.

1183~~~
Nevermind his defending, he's one of three players this half I would genuinely described as pointless going forward.

1184~~~
I don't know, in terms of position he's a liability. Caught too far up the field and then he is too slow to get back. Long balls aimed to him should never a tactic to start matches with, at least wait for the defenders to have gotten tired in the last 10-15 minutes. Tactically, what he's asked to do is completely pointless.

1185~~~
He reminds me of an 8-year old playing at his local sports centre, just running around the field without any sort of position. His discipline is horrendous.

1186~~~
Well to be fair our captain does the exact same thing and gets praised for it.

1187~~~
He was unlucky to come off last week but he should be off at half time, been useless and is a liability defensively, same can be said of mata to be fair.

1188~~~
Worst performer on the field. Can't even win any  header from n the box.

1189~~~
He's clearly been told to get forward and support the attack at every opportunity. It's a direct response to the criticism of not having enough men in the box. Now we do but it leaves us more open. It's exactly the kind if risk taking that people have been asking for.

What he can be blamed for is being consistently offside and, when he is deeper, being completely useless defensively. I can't remember a worse centre mid defensively. He's worse than Liam Miller in that sense - players ghost past him for fun.

1190~~~
The foolish coach will never learn

1191~~~
Our defending with him in midfield is terrible, you can't blame our defenders. Players are allowed to run through on them however they want in last three games, and barely anyone is mentioning it. His positioning and tracking back is embarrasing for a a premierleague player, let alone for a title contender team. I remember when we first paired Carrick and Schweinsteiger in fecking preseason game people immidiately decided they aren't good pair because of that even though they are on different level in comparision with any pairing with Fellaini.

1192~~~
Thing is, it would be excusable if he <i>sometimes </i>got caught out of position because of that. But he doesn't. He <i>always </i>gets caught out of position sometimes it costs us, sometimes he doesn't. But he is completely incapable of playing alongside a single midfield partner.

1193~~~
It's a stupid response then. Ideally you want your midfielder to make late runs (like Lampard at his best) so that defending on him would be a lot more difficult. Now it's just too easy, he has little movement and he always expects long balls. The idea is right but the execution is retarded.

1194~~~
I don't think he's playing alongside Carrick. He's playing ahead of him alongside Mata.

1195~~~
Surely if his role was as a #8 then he is required to get back and help Carrick, but in truth he doesn't have the mobility or speed for that, so LvG asking him to play so high up but expecting him to also help out in CM is at fault.

1196~~~
Shit on a very long stick.

1197~~~
What a player to be starting for Manchester United, eh?

Oh how the mighty of fallen. 

Plan B... the cnut doesn't even accumulate to a Plan A.

1198~~~
I can't believe this guy actually plays for us.

1199~~~
Why on God's green Earth is he still at the club? Is it a punishment?

1200~~~
I dont blame him for playing I blame the guy that keeps relying on him (and seems to be starting him in a 2 man midfield with Carrick) but then looking like telling him to push forward and stay there.

One thing I do blame him for is how he doesnt actually jump when crosses are put in. He really shouldnt be losing headers yet he somehow does.

1201~~~
What's ironic is that the supposedly attacking, bold, Dutch total-football enthusiast has used him and centered his game plan on him more frequently than wee Davie Moyes.

When Moyes was in charge and we were hearing him openly talking about big rebuild, more big signings to come I half-expected him to ditch Fellaini. He got sacked and a year and a half later the big man is still here.

1202~~~
A clown. Redundant, slow, clumsy... How he is a premier league footballer is beyond me, let alone how he gets a game for Utd.
We will never contend a trophy with this clown anywhere near our starting XI.

THe only reason I rate him 1, is because it won't let me rate him zero. He's a symbol of the detritus the club is going through, the ghost of Moyes and the arrogance of Van Gaal.

1203~~~
Exactly, he has done this several times leaving us with basically a one man midfield. He had 37 touches in his 60mins. Herrera had 40+ after he came on. It just beggars belief that LVG puts him in midfield and then obviously tells him not to play there. Shocking stuff.

1204~~~
He's definitely being told to just get forward and not support the central midfield, meaning LVG's tactics are absolutely shite.

1205~~~
Said he was shite ages ago, cant be arsed to repeat the same thing 2 yeara later. I dont even notice him on the pitch any more.

1206~~~
I wonder will Mr Stat Gaal notice this, or will Fellaini inexplicably slip through the next again and avoid criticism. 
Fellaini needs to go & Van Gaal needs to go.

1207~~~
Exactly this. He was an Everton midfielder that had a good game against us once. Shite player, paid for over the odds by a shite manager & stubbornly persisted with by another currently shite manager.

Bags of shite all round this Christmas!

1208~~~
I'm a defender of Fellaini but he was poor. I only half blame him though because van Gaal clearly tells him to play in an advanced role, he wouldn't be picked if he decided to play that way himself. The space he leaves in midfield is a huge issue though. I am not really sure what LvG is thinking.

1209~~~
It's baffling. Carrick of 5 years ago wouldn't be able to cope, let alone a 35 year old Carrick. It's madness.

1210~~~
Ball-watcher.
Poor heading technique.
Can't do - in three or four laboured touches - what other midfielders can do in one or two quick ones.
Gives away fouls.
Horrible positional sense, which leads to him just jogging about somewhere.
Poor turning circle - leading to being turned or giving away fouls.

He's only useful when he's doing a role that involves zero brain power, zero positional sense, zero proper movement. Basically just being a nuisance near the opposition's goal.

1211~~~
Why does this mug still play for us??

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1212~~~
Just like Rooney disrupts the game play every chance he has. Did Van Gaal tell him his the focal point to all our attack

1213~~~
He makes us so much worse. Hate to wish for an injury, but seriously. Can't we get a minor hammy tweak or something?

1214~~~
You're making excuses for your beloved Depay in his thread after he destroys us with stupidity, and then you want one of our players injured?

You are the worst poster on this forum. The sooner you clear off to RAWK or Arsenal Mania the better.

1215~~~
Does he have a free role or something?

He's just wandering around half the time

1216~~~
In no other half decent club in the world would he get minutes

1217~~~
Whoa, easy there. Obviously it's Depay's fault - I  don't even like him - but as a goalkeeper in that situation, your LW under pressure and being closed down, you come closer to him to make life easier. That's just basic. 

I don't want Fellaini properly hurt, would just love to see us playing with 4 footballers  up front for once. If you believe he's contributing, please feel free to articulate that here. All I see is an excuse for our cowardly players to hoof it.

1218~~~
He has free role since we bought him because he doesn't have a discipline to keep position in any role he plays.

1219~~~
LVG deserves whatever he gets for sticking with this guy. No positional sense whatsoever.

1220~~~
I'd rather have Fellaini out there than a coward like your Depay.

1221~~~
He's the perfect example of someone just not being a United player.

1222~~~
playing Mata is like having 10 men

1223~~~
Coward! What has he done to deserve that criticism?

1224~~~
Seriously, go get some air at half time or something. I could care less about Depay. Saying DDG could have helped out is hardly supporting the prima donna. I'd have Young out there over him in a heartbeat.

This is the Fellaini thread. Given you're so worked up about a meaningless football match, why don't you offer something on him?

1225~~~
Hey, concentrate on the match, you might miss a United player getting injured...

1226~~~
Yep me also but It would be nice if any our players had some balls Smalling Young and Martial excluded

1227~~~
Such a nothing player.

1228~~~
Moyes faith in Fellaini is part of what made me lose hope in him, it's now a major reason as to why I've given up on LvG. Awful, braindead player.

1229~~~
If I was United's manager I would push for a deal with Stoke so that he finds himself playing in the other side after the second half. He's got Stoke player written all over him

1230~~~
He is a stupid player isn't he ? Wtf was that on the CK <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ?

1231~~~
Bullshit. Stoke won't go anywhere near him. This is not Pulis' Stoke.

1232~~~
what I like about fellers is how subtle he is. Try and twist a defenders head off waiting for a cross

1233~~~
he's killing me.

Such a braindead, lazy, static player.

1234~~~
£150 million spent on this clown, Depay, Mata, Schneiderlin, Herrera. Where are the performances to back up this amount of money spent ???????

1235~~~
What is the point of him? Has he won a single header that we're hoofing up to him?

1236~~~
Go to question why we keep persisting with him like this. I've said it before either it's tactical to let him have such freedom in which case I don't think his output can justify what he takes away from the team or he's going against the managers wishes in which case you question why it's allowed to continue.

1237~~~
Question:
Answer:

1238~~~
Once again, how on earth can a man of his height be so shit in the air?

1239~~~
I'm just trying to find the funny side of it. It is too depressing otherwise, the guy knows he's watched closely by refs during set pieces and he still does that. I mean wtf ?

1240~~~
Awful

1241~~~
He shows no real urgency to win aerial battles. That makes no sense whatsoever when he has this height advantage.

1242~~~
Send him to siberia in january.

1243~~~
I hate him.

I have never really hated a utd player in my time as a fan but I can't stand to see this guy in our shirt.

1244~~~
He was always like that ever since I watch him in premierleague. He looks interested in kicking people more than he looks interested in playing football.

1245~~~
Loves a good foul

1246~~~
Where is he playing? What is he trying to do?

1247~~~
Sell him, give him away for free, i dont want to see him ever again in a United shirt, the brainless cnut.

1248~~~
Useless.

1249~~~
How many easy chances has he missed in the past few weeks?

1250~~~
Good finish.

1251~~~
That chance should always be a goal.

1252~~~
His finishing is just awful.

1253~~~
I despise this twat. The only United player I have never warmed to.

1254~~~
3 in 3 games I think it is now?

1255~~~
It is becoming a consistent theme that whenever I see Fellaini play, I start to believe that he is not a footballer. I had this same assumption with Hernandez before but at least the latter skill set was more useful.

1256~~~
I thought he'd be the complete opposite of a van Gaal player, it's amazed me that he's become one of his favourites

In a system where you play so many sidewards passes and make so little runs, it just trebles the negative effect he has on the team

1257~~~
Only consistent thing about Fellaini is the fact he misses sitters.

1258~~~
This guy would never get a sniff at Bayern, Barca or Real Madrid. United seriously needs to raise its standards.

1259~~~
This is the second sitter he has missed in 3-4 games. The one redeeming quality of the guy was that he could score. Now he cannot even do that. Get rid.

1260~~~
That's stating the obvious.

1261~~~
Needs to go in January. I don't even think he should be kept around as 'an option' any more.

1262~~~
I just can't see what he is meant to bring to the team, crap in midfield if he stays there and just as bad upfront

1263~~~
Was impressed with his chest control on numerous occasions today.

1264~~~
Useless player

1265~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1266~~~
Please leave.

1267~~~
Surely we can pay someone to take him.

1268~~~
Poor again.

1269~~~
How the hell does he manage to play so much for the club when he is so abysmal ? Terrible footballer.

There are so many more teams you could mention instead of them tbh.

1270~~~
He could have got us a point today with the chances he fecked

1271~~~
Schneiderlin must have done something terrible or missed a cereal supper to not be able to get in ahead of moppy, absolutely shocking.

1272~~~
When it's windy as feck  it defies all logic to base your game plan around going route 1 to Fellaini.

1273~~~
First one was offside anyway.

1274~~~
How can such a tall guy be so crap in the air? He also has a habit of waiting for the ball to reach him rather than to move his arse towards it and be sure to get it. He is certainly not a top class player in any way, even if he has 10 elbows.

1275~~~
He's probably the only United player i am sure i want out.

1276~~~
Without doubt the most prolonged terrible footballer to play for utd in my lifetime.

I genuinely believe he's Djemba Djemba/Bebe bad. He makes Anderson look athletic, his aerial prowess is a bigger myth than Santa. 

He wouldn't make it into that Stoke/Bournemouth/Norwich team. 

A genuine horror show week in week out.

1277~~~
He symbolises everything that is wrong with United post-Fergie. Never in a million years a United player.

1278~~~
He's not good enough. Maybe at a club like Everton who know how to utilise him in a very specific way and aren't under pressure to play attacking football he's more useful but he should not be starting for us. He was a panic signing during a transfer window where the wheels started to fall off and we need to move him on.

1279~~~
He's just the most useless player I've ever seen play for United. The most "un-United" player ever. Players like Alan Smith, Luke Chadwick etc used to give their all for us even though they were never good enough for this level. This oaf is just pathetic. We gave Everton 27 million for him, we could have donated the money to charity instead.

1280~~~
What is it that makes him start games? LVG is making so many obvious mistakes

1281~~~
This guy is a walking joke.

1282~~~
He goes against everything the club stands for. He's not only a vicious animal, he's also a clumsy footballer who's not suited to a club with such traditionally good football.

1283~~~
I've always defended his performances and thought he can do a job in the centre of the park but he's undefendable today along with the rest of the squad. 

LVG's decision to continue playing him as a no.10 is just baffling and his downfall really.

1284~~~
First thing Mourinho needs to do with him is cut his hair.

Second thing is sell him

1285~~~
That is my biggest grief with him. The guy really shows no fight whatsoever. Ambles around 2 feet away from the CBs when they have the ball. The likes of Herrera scamper to close down opponents but he stays up top as if he will score a hattrick every time. Just hope we sell him in the summer and get some decent fee for him. He is the most useless player I have seen in that I don't know what exactly is it that he offers.

1286~~~
Probably the most useless player ever to play for United.

Hopefully Mourinho gives him a swift boot when the window opens.

1287~~~
You'd think LVG would:

Bring on Rooney for Fellaini, play him as a number 10 with Martial up front
Bring on Pereira for Memphis, play him on the left with Mata on the right
Have Carrick and Herrera boss the midfield.

But what LVG did:

Brought on Rooney for Memphis, pushed Martial out wide, kept Rooney up front as a number 9 with Fellaini in the hole.
Brought on Pereira for Herrera, and kept him in CM, where he got muscled off the ball every time he received it.

I seriously dont understand LVG's thinking.

1288~~~
You mean playing a CM in CM? He also made 19 touches and was only dispossessed once and made 1 incomplete pass so not anywhere near being muscled off the ball every time he received it. There are enough problems in the side, you really don't have to go making stuff up.

1289~~~
He needs to be put out of his misery. He's not got the skill-set for anything other than a target man - and an iffy one at that.
Someone like Alli or Tielemans could be/could have been signed for 1/3 the price at most. And they're already better players.

You can find better midfielders in the Championship.

1290~~~
I wanted to post something similar.

He didn't even look like he was trying to today. He survived the summer because he showed he can be useful at the tail end of last season but for a guy as untalented as he is to not put in any effort, it's criminal.

1291~~~
I'm really finding it hard to remember how he managed to be a Premier League midfielder for several years before we wasted £27m on him. Insultingly awful today.

1292~~~
Alan Smith was a damned good player and much underrated. That broken leg and Fergie's weird idea of turning him into a midfielder did the lad no favours.

1293~~~
Put him in a mid table side and he'll look quality. There's a reason why a lot of goal scoring chances fall to him because he puts himself about. At United or a supposed top side he'll struggle as we see as his weaknesses are highlighted due to having to reign himself in.

1294~~~
Carrick-Fellaini is the slowest CM I've ever seen in football and that include testimonial games

1295~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> has an agenda against certain United players and he always attacks those when someone else, particularly one of his darlings is criticised. It was\is the same with Kagawa, Herrera. 

Basically, if most of the Caf likes a player, he goes out of his way to shit on those players and makes a point of calling everyone else hipsters for liking them - which is ironic, really.

You're one step away of him calling you a Dortmund supporter. Also, don't ever defend the players he hates, like Depay and Herrera.

1296~~~
The trouble is, you see him going to all this effort trying to win a ball... but the oaf is just so uncoordinated and gangly that he almost inevitably will concede a foul in the process. Then he has this look of bewilderment on his face as if to say "it's not my fault I'm the human equivalent of an oak tree".

He is incredibly frustrating to watch.

1297~~~
He's just not good enough.  End of.  And unlike possibly some of the others, a change of manager won't make a difference.  Even Walrus can't be arsed enough to poke his oblong-shaped head into this thread and defend him anymore.

1298~~~
I said he was crap week after we bought him. Was called names at that time.

1299~~~
He had a good season last season, but he's clearly not good enough for the level we aspire to.

He should be sold in the summer.

1300~~~
I hope he never plays for United again, with a bit of luck LVG will be sacked by tomorrow and whoever is in charge come Chelsea will see sense and leave him sat in the stands. 

I actually hate watching United with him in our team, it's a huge sign of how times have changed.

1301~~~
You won't win much with the likes of Fellaini, Carrick, Rooney and Jones in your side. So much downright shit in the side.

1302~~~
Needs to be the first player out in the summer, West Brom, Sunderland, or Newcastle might be interested, but reckon he'll go abroad.

1303~~~
you'll continue to get shite too, the lad can do no wrong in some people's eyes.

fair f**ks to him, he wasn't going to turn down a move to united so you can't blame him for coming, but he's just woeful for a club of the standard we were/expect to be.

1304~~~
I remember when on other board I claimed that 15m€ would be too much for him.

1305~~~
Benitez wanted him in Napoli. Surprise move to Madrid? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1306~~~
Anyone who knows football said he was crap long before we bought him. The quintessential  mid table target man.

1307~~~
Could have long-reaching consequences. Ronaldo only comes 2nd for best styled hair in the Christmas party, becomes alienated, and leaves...

1308~~~
Last summer was the perfect chance to sell him, when his stock was about as high as it was ever going to get under us. But no, we're fecking idiots and prefer that players completely de-value themselves before we let them go. See Anderson.

I reckon, we would've rejected a £50m bid for David Luiz.

1309~~~
And lets not forget we paid more than his release clause just for shits and giggles.

1310~~~
Wouldn't put anything past them.

1311~~~
Fellaini being in the team epitomizes everything that has gone wrong in the team over the past couple of years.

He's simply not good enough for a team who have ambition beyond hoping to quality for the CL.

1312~~~
Stealing a living at the biggest club in England. Must be texting Moyes every night for bringing him here on massive wages.

Coward on the field, crap in the air, too slow, first player I'd sell come January.

1313~~~
With the way they're playing now, he wouldn't even have started for Stoke today.

1314~~~
He definitely wouldn't get back in that Everton team. Clubs are all moving forward, we are going backwards.

1315~~~
Terrible form and game but still a very good player.

1316~~~
One of the worst players to ever play regularly for United, in my opinion. He's everything that we should be looking to avoid in football.

Players like Fellaini make me want to stop watching the game.

1317~~~
The good news is other prem clubs could probably afford to pay him 3/4 of his wages. The bad news is he would probably turn into a star again every time he plays us. 

I still think keeping him as a squad player can't hurt, but he needs to be purely an impact sub whether attacking or defensively.

The fact is though we are relying on him to advance up the field, and that frankly is ridiculous.

1318~~~
In what sense?

1319~~~
He was awful once again, makes us so limited, will be delighted when never have to watch him play for us again. Along with mata and Rooney he needs to be shipped out in the summer.

1320~~~
A tall clown
An Everton midfielder
A ghost of the ruin Moyes dragged us to
A symbol of the state that LVG has led us to

1321~~~
It's weird, but today was the first game where I felt myself really turning against Fellaini. Of course, I've always felt he was slightly out of his depth at United, but I always felt he did his best, and would usually offer something to the team, even if it wasn't particularly glamorous. But today, I saw a guy making half-hearted attempts to win headers, giving away stupid fouls and missing yet another sitter. Perhaps I should have noticed this earlier, but today was the first time where I felt truly exasperated with him. It truly is incredible that we spend 27 million on this guy.

1322~~~
Do Napoli still want him? 

Why do so many of our chances fall to him FFS.

1323~~~
I don't think I could agree anymore to a post. I felt the same last season even.

1324~~~
Surely shifting him to the left, dropping Rooney in the hole, Martial as a number 9 and bringing Fellaini back to CM (heck even bringing him off) would have been a better way to go about it.

Regardless, I still think he needs to bulk up a bit more.

1325~~~
Mid table battering ram support striker, that's the peak of his career. Moyes however brought him in expecting him to be what Schneiderlin is for us now as a CM.

1326~~~
And he keeps MS out of our lineup. LVG has really lost the plot.

1327~~~
But it is hardly ever Carrick-Fellaini in CM. It is usually Carrick alone in CM while Fellaini up top.

Fellaini is definitely not a very good player, especially when you consider the kind of players United should target, but LVG's use of him has been as bad as Moyes'. He can do a decent job in midfield next to a Carrick but he is played as a second striker. Even yesterday it was Herrera in midfield partnering Carrick with Fellaini roaming around without a care in the world as if he was Ronaldo.

1328~~~
Proved it last season and at Everton. People calling him a clown and a disaster of a player just don't understand his quality. Starting midfielder for Man United quality? Nah. Squad player? Yes.

1329~~~
The amount of headers he DIDNT win is baffling. He barely needs to jump Vs most players so I dont get how he cant win headers consistently.

1330~~~
Other than a handful of games he has been useless for us and he has been a terrible signing, he hasn't even proven himself as a squad player unless we are ignoring the majority of the last two and a half seasons and basing that on his best moments. What he did at Everton is irrelevant because that has been and gone and doesn't help us, it's not about understanding his quality it's about admitting we never should have signed him, massively overpaid and he hasn't been good enough.

1331~~~
He's crap in the air, it's why he resorts to so many fouls.

Probably has the best chest control in the world though when taking a ball out of the air.

1332~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1333~~~
He's not a <i>terrible </i>footballer, as such, and did do well at Everton when they played to his strengths, but he's mostly been a bit crap for us here. Did well last season, but that's not enough to compensate for the fact that his spell here has been very poor overall.

He was bought to be a first team player, but has mostly failed to excel when placed into such a role. "He's a squad player", is an argument that's popped up to defend him because he's generally proven himself not to be good enough for our first team. It's only used <i>because </i>he's mostly played poorly for us, like others such as Young, and Valencia in recent years. I mean, yeah, if we desperately need numbers then I'm fine to hang onto players like Fellaini, but if we were to get a decent offer to get rid then it'd make sense to do so, for example, and he's not the type of player whose contract I'd extend either. Essentially, the main reason he's seen as a 'squad player' by some is because he's just not good enough to be in our starting side most of the time.

1334~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1335~~~
this is what I don't understand, he's crap at the plan B he is supposed to be useful for. Cant jump, or gives a foul rightly or wrongly

1336~~~
I think he could take the brunt of the fans abuse if it turns against us tomorrow and he's on the pitch, he's pretty much universally disliked by the fans who see him as a symbol of the clubs decline. 

He's also a fvcking awful footballer.

1337~~~
It's about effort and positioning and he lacks in both when it comes to winning headers. It's ridiculous because he has such an advantage, compare him to Andy Carroll who uses efficiently his body to win headers.

1338~~~
He shouldn't be a squad player either. We played 5 games in a row in a set up that suits his strengths and he showed absolutely nothing. Played almost like a striker, had no defensive tasks whatsoever, and he scored one goal and missed couple of sitters. He doesn't even win headers ffs.

He is a player for midtable club who shouldn't be nowhere near United. If Moyes didn't buy him there is no decent manager that would want him here. We talk all the time about aspiring to be like Barcelona, Bayern but we are happy with Fellaini in our squad. People want us to go forward, and want players like Mata out of the club but at the same time they don't mind Fellaini playing for us, incredible.

We never had this type of player in a team, and we did fine, I am sure we could do well without him in the future too.

We would be much better if we had someone like Hernandez as our plan B if we are all insisting on having that plan B.

No doubt someone will quote me and say I have an agenda against him and can't see that he is actually good player.

I seriously cannot understand how can someone like a player who is lazy - strolling on the pitch 90% of the time, kicks people intentionally in every game, hardly does any defensive work, and is shite footballer all around.

1339~~~
I remember creating a thread about selling Fellaini and Young when their stocks were high during the end of LvG's first season. I knew this was gonna happen. It was blatantly obvious he's nowhere near the quality we require from our players. He's a midfielder who is not expected to pass. Show me one pass he's made since he wore the red shirt that is more than 7 yards. How can he call himself a midfielder when he just stands there to win headers which he couldn't even do against the likes of Stoke. And how many number of clear cut chances has he missed in the past few weeks? Yes he has his strengths but it just doesn't suit us. We struggle to cross the ball even if we manage to get into dangerous areas. He's gonna end up as that player who never performed for us but always puts in his best when he plays against us. We'll sell him for peanuts. Waste of money really.

He must have fouled a million times and every time the referee blows his whistle, he acts as if he has no clue what happened and acts all surprised. A slow mo replay would show him eye gouging another player and fellaini would be standing there bewildered what the hell just happened with a sarcastic grin on his face. At least man up and take responsibility for your fouls. Am actually surprised he hasn't been sent off as many times I expected him to when we brought him. Didn't even concede that many penalties. 

We built a team to accommodate players like Fellaini instead of building it around good players. LvGs biggest mistake is building teams to minimize the limitations of lesser players. We can never progress if we have players like him around. Expect us to haggle around for some years in the transfer market losing money in wages waiting for the 'right' offer only to sell him for 2.5M or so.

1340~~~
Have said for a while we're trying to accommodate Fellaini and Mata as they were big buys. We'd only get 5-7 million for Fellaini and that's about all he is worth before. We should've cut our loses at the start of this season.

He profited from Ashley Young playing on the left and helped us get fourth. He got us out of some tricky situations granted but he's not consistent and not good enough in the United attack or midfield and done nothing this season.

How we've ended up with Carrick alone and Fellaini running around bundling opposing players over after the summer transfer period is really upsetting.

Moyes allegedly brought him here as a midfielder but all he ever was for Everton was a nuisance forward player who got away with a lot. He should not be a even squad player for United.

We've had our players like Roy Keane who play dirty sometimes and get involved but Fellaini seems to get involved far too many times over anything the opposing players does and wants revenge. He leaves his foot or arm in almost every game. You can even see him looking up and down at the player to put the elbow in just before the ball comes. He's daft and clumsy and should not be considered a striker for us either. I don't care if he scores against Chelsea or has a few good months.

1341~~~
Not sure why people hate him so much. It's not his fault his doofus manager has an entire game plan revolving around the height of one player (LOL). So much for philosophy. Besides, his best performances came in a midfield three where he was able to mix his strengths with Blind and Young to create a very effective triumvirate of players on the left side of the pitch, which the likes of Spurs, City and Liverpool had no reply to. Such was his form, the Champions were forced to compile a game plan where the key was to stop the mop. It's a shame our clueless manager doesn't remember the set of games that kept him at the helm of the club, till now. 

As for Fellaini himself, it's a testament to how crap we've been recently, that he's actually been our most effective player is recent games. Unlike the rest of the of the team, he's got himself into actual positions where he can take advantage of the one cross we deliver per game, however, his ineffective finishing and some good saves from opposition keepers have prevented him from scoring a few times. People easily forget that he gave us a sniff against Wolfsburg and Bournemouth. It's a shame his first name isn't Ander.

1342~~~
I can't speak for others but when I say "he's a squad player" I mean it in the the long term sense. Yeah we bought him as a starting eleven player and I have also always believed he would be able to make it especially after his really good form last season (which a few here have discredited to "just a few games") but it seems to me I along with the United staff was wrong about that. He is a big inconsistent or mismanaged to be part of the integral first team line up. 

So even if what you say is correct - he's a squad player because he wasn't good enough to be a first teamer as was intended - what's so wrong about that? People here are calling him a clown and worst player in the PL. It's a typical Caf reaction at players they don't like (Young/Park/Gibson/Fletcher in the past have all suffered this). He's a very good player on a bad run in a team that's being severely mismanaged right now

1343~~~
Well I don't hate him and thank him for his performances of last season. He can be effective if used correctly but all his faults outweigh what he can do, example his how many times he's won a header but it's straight to the defenders or has given the ball away or gave away silly fouls while we're chasing the game. I'd actually like LVG to revert back to last season if Fellaini is going to be used. Memphis hasn't helped and Young hasn't been his direct replacement during the games, which is odd as the Fellaini Young combo worked well when needed. Ultimately I don't think he should've been signed, I don't think we should be trying to find a spot for him next season if we have the funds, he's not consistent or good enough overall and holding us back.

1344~~~
It's when people say crap like that I'm convinced the most they saw of Fellaini before United was in MOTD highlights.

1345~~~
Please tell us more.

1346~~~
Its like playing with 10 men, with the trade off that you win like 15% more knock ons from goal kicks. Philosophy.

1347~~~
LvG and his national team manager both play him as a midfielder. Have you ever considered that you're the one who's wrong about him?

1348~~~
Have you ever considered that Fellaini himself has said he's a forward player. Have you heard of Phil Neville? Are you aware he played for Everton and said Fellaini is forward player.

It's when people come up with crap like this that I know they're heavily influenced by his last season at Everton and haven't seen much.

Also when I say Forward player I drop the word striker, I don't say he's a striker. his game his effecting the forward play and also LVG who is not some muppet MOTD watcher also says he's a forward player.

1349~~~
Fellaini himself said he wanted to be the new Keane. Overly-ambitious, perhaps, but he saw himself as a midfielder.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24087675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24087675</a>

1350~~~
This is bullshit to the highest standard. Can you tell me a player who would perform well if not used correctly?

1351~~~
Have you forgotten what you just said?

I was actually going along with you a bit there but Jesus Christ at your reply.

1352~~~
Yes I remember it well. That's what Moyes brought him here to be and it's a pretty obvious statement to make as a new signing. He's also said his position is not a midfielder or defensive midfielder and he doesn't like defensive midfield.

1353~~~
And Moyes actually said in the wake of all this he saw him as our Frank Lampard. Get your head round that, people

1354~~~
Yeah, but if you ignore what Fellaini said and what Moyes said and where Moyes played him and where LvG plays him and where the Belgium manager plays him... he's a forward.

1355~~~
Everton fans will tell you Fellaini was a DM for 4 of his 5 years. Only got pushed up when Cahill left and they were too skint to replace him.

1356~~~
I don't think I've ever disliked a United player as much as I dislike Fellaini. I don't even want to watch us when I see his name in the starting lineup.

1357~~~
Theres a difference between what youve said and what I did. If youre not able to identify the context of our posts, then theres little I can do.

1358~~~
He's a dreadful footballer - his only 'skill' is being a nuisance. The problem is that even though he could be an effective 'plan B' in the final 10 minutes, his brain-dead stupidity means that he's more likely to give away a foul...I've lost count of the times that he doesn't even try to head the ball and just backs into a jumping player (sometimes throwing an elbow), which will be given as a foul pretty much every time. 

That face grab against Stoke just sums him up...laughably stupid and his presence in the team is a microcosm of the problems at the club - throwing close to £30m on a player with no real ability, who wouldn't get close to being in a 'top' side. I don't 'hate' him but my heart sinks when he's on the team sheet - watching him makes me question why I watch football, given the complete lack of joy I experience whilst doing so.

1359~~~
The fact that his role as a squad player isn't because of his ability; it's because he has largely failed as a signing, and has regressed to being deadweight. He's not a player who seems to fit our playing style at all: the main argument for him being that he offers something <i>different</i>, because he's tall and physical. I'm all for squad players. In Park and Fletcher, you've just named two who, while not the greatest players to play for us, had very good spells with the club, and who were both consistent and dependable hard-workers when called upon.

Fellaini isn't really that. His positioning is woeful, his discipline is poor and he's wildly inconsistent whenever he comes on. He doesn't strike me as a squad player, in that respect. He's someone who'd probably be sold if it wasn't for our squad imbalance at the moment.

1360~~~
Pretty much sums up how I feel about him as well.

I don't even think he's useful in the role people claim to be his useful role.

1361~~~
Very funny. You're actually ignoring what he's said, what his fellow professional has said and where LVG has played him and where he ends up in many matches he plays for both teams. I can understand your other claims about where Moyes officially played him at Everton in some seasons, not LVG.

Truth is Fellaini claimed to be both things, there was a huge question about what his position was after his first year here, nobody starts wondering if Keane is some type of forward, Keane is not played a whole season as a forward or claims to his teammates he a forward and wants a more forward position to the manager. I wouldn't really be that particular and call him a true defensive midfielder but we could've done with that in the last two games though. Shame his much vaunted natural defensive midfield Everton defined qualities couldn't be used to help poor Carrick or even come to the fore under Moyes.

For me he's mixed bag but lacks a lot to be called proper position.

1362~~~
No. That wasn't just a new signing statement. He has said he prefers to play in midfield before he signed for United, more than once. Such as this from 2012:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/8298821/evertons-marouane-fellaini-would-prefer-to-play-as-a-defensive-midfielder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...ould-prefer-to-play-as-a-defensive-midfielder</a>

Also, when he's been used as a forward by LvG, he says he plays there to help the team, but he wants to play in midfield, so he's clearly not just pandering to the manager.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/fellaini-im-midfielder-not-striker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/fellaini-im-midfielder-not-striker</a>

When he signed:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11486031/Liverpool-v-Manchester-United-Marouane-Fellaini-will-hold-the-key-on-Sunday-but-what-sort-of-player-is-he.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...-on-Sunday-but-what-sort-of-player-is-he.html</a>
Care to post these quotes where he says he doesn't like to play defensive midfield? Because there are at least 3 counts of him saying it is his best position, and I can't find any of him saying otherwise.

I'm also not aware of PNev saying that. Can you post the quotes? Here are the ones I can find:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31901145" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31901145</a>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2517359/Marouane-Fellaini-needs-goal-insists-Manchester-United-coach-Phil-Neville-ahead-Everton-clash.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...d-coach-Phil-Neville-ahead-Everton-clash.html</a>

No. He's played predominantly as a CM or a DM every year bar 12/13 when Cahill left.

15/16: CM/DM 14 apps, AM 4 apps, CF 1 app
14/15: CM/DM 22 apps, AM 6 apps
13/14: CM/DM 23 apps, AM 3 apps
<b>12/13: CM/DM 7 apps, AM 29 apps</b>
11/12: CM/DM 38 apps, AM 3 apps
10/11: CM/DM 15 apps, AM 5 apps
09/10: CM/DM 20 apps, AM 16 apps

Infact, it was the brutish defensive job he did on Liverpool at Anfield for Standard Liege in the Champions League that brought him to the attention of English clubs. The only coach who I have heard say Fellaini is best as an advanced player is Steve Round. It's up for debate as to how valuable Round's opinion is.

1363~~~
You're backtracking now. You said he's a forward player and not a midfielder (and that's all he EVER was). He's had excellent games at Everton in the midfield (and before someone bites on this, this is in response to the above poster and not a reasoning as to why he can be a successful midfielder for us).

1364~~~
I guess his first touch on the chest and heading wont count. 

On a side note, why do fans have to discredit EVERYTHING about a player just because they're playing bad? I guess it's the way we fans are. We exaggerate the highs and the lows.

1365~~~
We played our best football under LVG when Fellani was starting in that inside left position and we were actually really good for a while.

1366~~~
One can also say that those same matches were it seemed clear that Herrera and Mata played with so much freedom ahead of Carrick. The tandem between those was the real key in those games. They were the unsung heroes in those "games"

1367~~~
Remember when he said he wanted to be a defensive midfielder <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1368~~~
He makes me feel how I imagine a woman, with an up coming period, feels

1369~~~
Absolutely and it also was the only time I thought that Mata was finally getting to his best playing for us.

1370~~~
Heading definitely won't count, he's really strangely average at them whereas he has such a big advantage on his opponents.

1371~~~
A complete myth myth that's primarily born out of refusal to credit either of Fellaini or Young, without whom we wouldn't have finished top 4. In those games, It was the triumvirate of Blind, Young and Fellaini down the left side that was the biggest cause of worry for the opposition and something they couldn't deal with. One would think Herrera and Mata were running exchanging 1-2's left, right and centre before scoring past the keeper. It was only the Liverpool game where they combined in that run and even then it was more down to one pass than anything else.

1372~~~
I just don't get the freedom he is allowed. He is simply not good enough nor effective enough to warrant it. Last season during our good spell he did play an important role in it, it was a tactic that caught teams out until they knew it was coming but a key part of it was giving Fellaini a specific role and instructions, well that's what it looked like. This season, particularly in recent games it's like he's just been let lose on the pitch which might be ok if he was playing as a 10 but often he's been one of the cm's and it's just baffling as it leaves us so exposed and not to mention that whilst Fellaini might be able to get in to some decent positions from higher up the pitch he doesn't help any of the other attackers really.

Fellaini can do a job as part of the squad, I have no doubts about that. How we've used him, particularly this season is very questionable imo. As I said he might get the odd opening as a result of it but the impact on the team be it stupid fouls, leaving his cm partner isolated and outnumbered, slowing the attack etc means that for me his current use is at spite of the overall team performance. Tbf to him though that's not his fault as presumably he's just doing what he's been asked to do.

1373~~~
Oh,  I'm not depriving him of any credit but I'm equally tired of fans attributing the success of that run to Fellaini. It's the run that has been used as an excuse for him for almost 12 months. Mata and Herrera and Carrick were as crucial in that set up but no one bangs on about it for an excuse.

1374~~~
Fellaini plays we don't score. Simple

Just like when Jones plays we concede.

LVG will play both today in yet another stubborn, defiant, arrogant two fingers up to each and every one of us. 
I'd love Fellaini to get run out of OT on LVGs coat tails when he gets screamed off the pitch today.
You can throw Mr Commercial Woodward in the mix too, they can all share a taxi.

1375~~~
Fellaini was arguable more crucial than anyone except Carrick and maybe Young. None of Liverpool, City or Spurs could deal with him. And that wasn't the only time either. He was one of our best players against City away and Chelsea at home as well.

1376~~~
Like you haven't conceived a child again this month? 
He must be doing major damage in training to get this many repeat chances.

1377~~~
When I say he's a (nuisance forward) I don't even mean a forward I would never simply label him as a forward or striker. I wasn't expecting some to pick up on that and was going to put nuisance midfield/forward but with people saying def mid I guess it wouldn't have mattered.

I decided to use the term nuisance forward. While he's a midfielder on the team sheet he ends up being some kind of forward that lacks a classic description, he's like a disrupter and likes to get and stay forward doing work in his unique way. We tried him as a proper midfielder and he looked like a fish out of water. This is not about him playing badly there, he couldn't fulfill the other jobs other than tackling and was completely lost how to carry it out, like sticking Michael Owen in as centre back, hence all the questions in the game on what his position is as clearly being in midfield was a problem for him. Phil comes out as says he's not really a midfielder. I already knew it wouldn't work before he signed.

When I see him elbowing central defenders, watching wingers and midfielders launching it up to Fellaini for the trillionth time I will remember that he's actually playing defensive mid.

1378~~~
I think it's no coincidence that the pace of our attacking play is much quicker without him bumbling around.

1379~~~
His best game for Utd yet yesterday. I hope to see him deployed more in this role until he eventually graduates to the reserves and then becomes a full time ex-Utd player.

1380~~~
Think before this fella gets slaughtered there are many before him that deserve it first. He gives his all yes he's limited but is that his fault? We have had quite a few cowardly players and performances this season none from Fellaini. Easy target for a few on here.

1381~~~
Yet arguably we have had our best football for a while with him in the team. 

He worked very well with Blind and Young on the left as well as Carrick and Herrera in midfield.

1382~~~
Are you referring to the football we played the second half of last season? It worked, and we looked great at that point, but we got found out pretty quickly and have been unable to replicate it since. The problem is, when we try and play to accommodate Fellaini, it limits us in so many other ways.

I always backed Fellaini when we signed him, and the fact that recently he is always the one that seems to be getting the chances (despite missing sitters) shows that he has his uses. It's also glaringly obvious that we cannot play the style of football we (well, the fans at least) wish to with him starting games. Keep him on the bench, bring him on a as plan B (or even plan C) if we have to, but he should not be finding a place in our first team. If all else fails, ship him out.

1383~~~
The problem isn't his application of effort, the problem with Fellaini is the fact he's a symbol of how bad we've become. There is no way on this earth Fellaini should ever be wearing at United shirt, having said that there is a whole list of players in the last 6 years who shouldn't be wearing the red of United.

1384~~~
Delighted he didn't play, the tactics in recent weeks have been awful and Fellaini's complete lack of football intelligence have been a massive hindrance.

1385~~~
In the right team the big guy can still cut it. We just not the right team.

1386~~~
Ya a midtable team.

1387~~~
He might give it his all, but he should not be starting for us imo. I struggle to see which other teams he would be starting for in the league (especially in the top half).

He should only be used as a Plan B (for the final 10 minutes at most, and if we have people who can cross, and hes used as somebody behind the striker when were desperate).

1388~~~
Fellaini was the marquee Moyes buy in the summer of 2013. When you think about the Moyes buys, how many of them have made a massive impact this season?

Fellaini.  Virtually zero impact.
Mata.  Very little impact.
Varela.  Actually a Moyes buy, promising in his two appearances this season, but very little impact.

I consider Rooney a "Moyes buy", since we had the opportunity to sell him to Chelsea but instead extended and enriched his contract.  Virtually zero impact.

1389~~~
Since signing, Mata has contributed more goals + assists than any other United player. Not sure what you define as 'very little impact' though.

1390~~~
He isn't good enough to play as a midfield partner with Carrick at all.

LvG got his selection wrong last time he played Fellaini. Fellaini at #10 or not at all (id rather not at all).

1391~~~
The fact that Mata and Fellaini are in the same bracket is a fail. Mata has been involved with most of our goals.

1392~~~
I guess it's all relative.  We've scored very few goals, right?  Right.

If we, for example, scored two goals all season but it was Mata who scored would you say that since Mata has scored all our goals this season that he's been brilliant for us?  I hope not.

Mata has, in fact, had very little impact.  He hasn't been a horror show like Rooney or Fellaini, but I don't think anyone here would argue that we're perfectly set at right attacking mid and there's no need whatsoever for an upgrade at that position.  

Mata has obvious class, but he offers too little physically and drift out of game for long stretches.  Apart from hitting the bar early on, he disappeared against Chelsea.

1393~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/06/manchester-uniteds-marouane-fellaini-agrees-ac-milan-transfer-5603545/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/06/manch...e-fellaini-agrees-ac-milan-transfer-5603545/?</a>

Fellani to Milan eh?

1394~~~
Mata to Juventus too.. When we have the adequate replacements both quality & quantity wise - i dont think many would mind. 

Sometimes the Serie A is like a carboot sale!

1395~~~
If true, this just shows how far Milan have fallen.

1396~~~
Hope this is true 

No harm to the big fella but selling him would be a promising indication on the future of how we plan to play 

He is slow, lumbering with limited passing range and technique - sadly his glorious chest control doesn't mask the fact that we paid close to 30 million for a Kevin Nolan type player - feck you Moyes

1397~~~
Replacing Fellani's role with Pereira is a natural progression for me (not that I'm asking for Pereira to be ahead of Fellani in the pecking order right now).Of course Pereira can't play as a backup striker but we need one more striking option regardless anyway.

1398~~~
Getting 20 mil for him would be an absolute coup given how much his value has fallen.

1399~~~
*Sees £15 million for Fellaini... then sees 'according to The Daily Express*

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://media.giphy.com/media/VBHenUonSCry8/giphy.gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VBHenUonSCry8/giphy.gif"/>

1400~~~
Let's get rid of our only forward option off the bench...

Wait until the summer. The squad depth mess LVG has made can be sorted properly then.

1401~~~
Di Marzio confirms Milan's interest in Fellaini.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://gianlucadimarzio.com/news-cat/milan-da-jose-mauri-a-fellaini-il-punto-sul-mercato-rossonero/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gianlucadimarzio.com/news-cat/milan-da-jose-mauri-a-fellaini-il-punto-sul-mercato-rossonero/</a>

This guy is never wrong when it comes to Italian teams. He is not sticking his neck out yet though, but them being interested is good news.

1402~~~
Anyone being intrested in him is a blessing. Getting 20m for him is even better. God i wish he'd leave.

1403~~~
If he's smart he'd take the move.

He's got a contract for another two years here in the summer, but we'll be trying to hush him away. Milan will offer similar wages to us, and probably give him a 4 year deal. The slower pace of Italian football will suit him too, if he had more time on the ball he'd probably not look as much of a donkey.

1404~~~
I bet Milan fans are sitting refreshing their Fellaini thread in their transfer forum with trepidation as wistful memories of when they bought the elite of football play in their minds. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1405~~~
Italian football would suit him well. I really wanted him to succeed here but i didn't take into account his complete lack of football talent

1406~~~
Thing is Fellaini is not a bad option to have off the bench sometimes.
We are playing such awful football anyway that bring Felliani on and punting it up field to him at least offers us a chance of scoring.

His goal last season against Palace was the one that virtually secured us fourth place, and his goal against Brigge really took the pressure off in the second leg, he does have his uses.

Obviously if we have a replacement lined up and intend on playing in such a way that will score more goals then he can go, but in likely absence of that I'd keep him for now.

1407~~~
He was useful last season, but has been absolutely rank for a vast majority of this season. Teams have figured out how to play when we chuck him on and hopelessly launch balls, or when we play him in central midfield where his inability to tackle and lack of mobility are easily exploited. More fool Milan, I say.

1408~~~
This is how i see him too.  I mean I sell him every chance I get but ultimately we play one style of football now for 95% of the time.  A player like him is useful.  I dont see why he couldn't one day be useful as solsksjker.

1409~~~
can see us becoming the next milan if we don't get critical decisions right for the next several years.

1410~~~
Because Fellaini is not half as good as Ole. Some people need to brush up their memory about Ole's ability on the ball and his finishing and movement off the ball before making such silly comparisons.

1411~~~
Wtf.  You think im comparing his ability to his?  I know he isnt as good & i know he wont be as loved as Ole was. 

Get off your high seat & realise Fellaini could come on a CL final score a last minute goal.  

He is the only plan B player we have.

1412~~~
You said he could be as useful as Ole was for us, then say he is not as good as Ole. Make up your mind. Ole was not useful because we simply threw him at the end of games; he worked as a great sub because he was so good that he would walk into our starting 11 right now. Fellaini, apart from chest control, is as useless as they come for a plan B.

1413~~~
Milan are skint. They will probably want him on loan and with us paying most of his salary. That's what happens when a big club signs a Bolton type of player

1414~~~
If that's  the case then sack the manager and bring in someone whose capable of spending 200m+ and come out with more than one plan because of it. Fellaini shouldn't even sniff the CL let alone play in a final

1415~~~
200 million doesn't buy you jack shit these days especially not a whole plan b. 

Sack this sack that..Just any excuse & he didnt even buy fellaini.

1416~~~
How many goals did he score coming off bench for us? Not many I would guess.

1417~~~
He can be used both defensively and aggressively.  I wouldn't be sad to see him leave but we really should be papering over the cracks in our squad rather than creating more - no matter how minor.

1418~~~
I agree however it should at least give a club a plan b. LvG could have achieved that by simply retaining nani (inconsistent player but who always had that unpredictably in his locker), adm and Chica. Instead LvG let them go cause they didn't fit in his philosophy. Fellaini would have left too if napoli offer in the summer wasn't so shit. LvG wanted every player ton abide to his philosophy. He can't complain I'd the team is one dimensional

1419~~~
He is too slow and lacks the positioning to play DM and he lacks creativity and technique to play AM. However I think this shouldn't be the argument at all. We've got a very limited player and whose on great salary. There's no way we will be able to get him off our hands without practically gifting him for free (loan with maybe the right for the loanee club to buy at a minimum fee which would be next to nothing + we must foot much of his salary). Under such circumstances I bet that Nolan erm Fellaini is here to stay

1420~~~
It's just as I feared. We've arrived at a point where we can't even give Fellaini away for free.

1421~~~
Has he even scored coming off the bench? 

If anything his best contributions come when he starts.

1422~~~
It would be ridiculous to sell him now unless we have significant reinforcements coming in. 

It's not his fault he's used as one of our main attacking plans. He should be nothing more than a squad player, it's first team quality we need and that won't be aided by culling our squad players.

1423~~~
if we have to be brave enough one day to play a style of football that doesn't include fellaini, then so be it. it says where we are when we have to keep this guy at the club. he isn't even good at plan B, cant jump and any challenge he makes ends up in a foul

1424~~~
He's utterly shite in the air for his height. He is actually 28 million pounds of chest control, thats it.

1425~~~
He did against Brugge early this season. Possibly against West Brom I think last season was it? When he came on at half time.

1426~~~
I hope he is sold just so that I can stop reading pathetic and embarrassing comments in this thread and the match threads most weeks.

1427~~~
Fellaini offers nothing on, or off the bench, other than making the rest of the team panic and hoof long balls up to his stupid afro. 
His alleged aerial threat is a bigger myth than Atlantis. He's simply not good in the air, he's not good on the ground, he's slow, he has no footballing brain, he's dirty & cynical in all the wrong ways. I long for the day he's shipped off to some lower league obscurity, because that's where he's destined for. Anyone who thinks a top level team will be in for this lanky clown is off their nut!

1428~~~
Fixed. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I hope you're learning Italian in preparation for blindly defending him on Milan forums.

1430~~~
The only blindness here is the blind and irrational levels of hatred for Fellaini on this place.

1431~~~
Fellani was a very good player for us last season. He is not suddenly shit. van Gaal has used him very poorly.

1432~~~
I agree, he has not been used well at all this season

That isnt a pop at Lvg as it was Van Gaal who found a way to use him brilliantly last season and not just a last resort route 1 mechanism.

He has a very good engine on him, and wins back position well. Those skills arent being utilized at all this season.

1433~~~
van Gaal had the entire team playing well for a good part of last season. I honestly thought we would run away with the title this season.

I don't want to start another van Gaal rant. But I am scratching my head about what has happened so far this season......<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1434~~~
We simply changed the wrong things and didnt improve on what  we were doing well. 

And perhaps we needed someone else to push us to that next level.

As for Fellaini, he should simply not be played in a midfield 2. All our midfielders work better in a 3,

1435~~~
agree. The only way our midfield can work in a 'two set up' is if we ever find another Roy Keane. Though Herrera may be about 80% of Scholes, there is no one who is anywhere near as good as Keane.

1436~~~
Was funny to hear Jim Beglin during the 0-0 Chelsea game suggesting the option of Fellaini coming on and making a nuisance of himself.

1437~~~
I hate watching him in midfield, it's just not his thing.

1438~~~
When a footballer is reduced to being a nuisance then something is truly wrong with him.

1439~~~
I thought he was pretty good in the first half. Won the ball back well, and made a very important header from that corner right at the near post.

I cheered that nutmeg in the first half more than I cheered the goal.

1440~~~
I feel sorry whenever anyone has to partner him in central midfield. We're always crap when it happens.

1441~~~
Its safe two say the switch from 4-1-2-3 to 4-2-3-1 has severely blunted out attacking instincts. Going forward we were better with a midfield set up of one holder and two attacking midfielders.

1442~~~
He was the best of a bad bunch. And he was no more than average.  

I hate the way LvG either plays him really deep or really far forward too. Scrap the number 10. No one plays it well enough to warrant it.

1443~~~
Can you imagine a manager telling his chief scout "I want you to go find me the next nuisance, pronto"

1444~~~
He started fairly well, but ultimately he should not be playing in a midfield two. He doesn't have the game for it, and the team as a whole will always struggle to function properly when he's in there.

1445~~~
I'm not one of his critics, I just ignore him. He shouldn't be at the club. It's that simple.

1446~~~
I'm not his biggest fan but the circumstances have not been fair to him, I've got to say. He's never played well in midfield and he's never going to, at the highest level. He is not a central midfielder and it's unrealistic to expect him to perform well playing as one. He does try his best, that's evident for me and I do appreciate that. I think he realizes his limitations and tries to do as well as possible within them but it's never going to be good enough. Either play to his strengths or don't play him. The abuse he's getting is unnecessary though. It'd be like criticizing Smalling for being shit when playing as a winger.

1447~~~
Before we bought Martial last minute, VG's plan was to have this guy as our 2nd choice forward. 

Ridiculous really.

1448~~~
MoTM tonight for me.

1449~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1450~~~
This mostly echoes my thoughts. He has a great attitude and a fairly unique - but limited - skillset. In the right sort of system he can be an excellent PL player - we saw that at times last season, and we saw it during his time at Everton.

As <a class="username" data-user="64468, @Scarecrow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64468/">@Scarecrow</a> says - the level of abuse he gets from 'fans' is unnecessary and completely disproportionate to his level of contribution. Many people on here clearly made up their mind on Fellaini long ago, see him as a reminder of Moyes or whatever, and literally just have it in for him. He is not what is wrong with our team and has been no worse than the vast majority of our players so far this season, and was one of our better players last season. Go figure.

1451~~~
We already fecking are.

1452~~~
I honestly cant blame him for the most part, cos hes never been a 2 man midfielder type. Yet we still insist on feckin doing it (defensive midfielder at that, or sometimes we are looking for him to be box to box).

Its just insane, yet the management continue to do it. In fact he (along with Mata) should have been the first sub to go. 

Honestly, he should be a plan C which is total desperation, losing with 5-10 minutes to go and putting him behind two strikers and just chucking him into the box to cause a nuisance cos thats all hes good at right now. (saying that, he hardly even jumps now).

1453~~~
I think we can still salvage this situation if we act fast, as we have good number of players who are class but are being held back by LVG. (e.g. herrera, martial)

problem is, we will probably dither until it's too late, again. and it will set us back, again. if you interpret that as us being the new milan already then I won't object to that.

1454~~~
My gripe with Fellaini is not with the whole Moyes saga, that was not his fault. Who wouldn't take the opportunity to play for United?. I do not dislike the guy (the first player I took a selfie with before he made a name at Everton). The guy is just not good at football. We can't keep on playing the "limited" card all the time, it's just an excuse not to make us look like harsh fans. One would think that Fellaini is just some 18 year old kid coming from a a foreign league. Heck, if he was a youth player, playing the way he is playing I seriously doubt our fans would want us to acquire his services.

We can't keep on using tactics to shy away from the fact he should be doing better as a professional footballer. Fellaini is a PL footballer, plying his trade with one of the biggest team in the world WITH almost a decade (TEN YEARS) of PL experience under his belt. He is only behind Rooney and Carrick in our team in this regard (let that sink in) and ALL we can say is that he is good at chest control. Come on, let's be honest and fair. 

I coach young players and they have a responsibility to improve certain aspects of their game. This has nothing to do with the coach but the individual himself. I am not convinced that Fellaini has any stand out attribute rather than those that are totally dependent on his physique, which in itself is not a skill. I am not impressed by the tallest guy on the pitch being able to reach a ball at height over shorter players, this is not a skill. The same way you should not be impressed by an 18 year old athlete outrunning a 50 year old athlete. Sometimes we make clips of players that these young players can watch to learn from and hone their skill. I can tell you that Fellaini is the one player that we have found it difficult to make a worthwhile video for a young player to assess. He is 28/29, I believe and should be around his prime, yet we don't know, neither does any of his managers know, I doubt even if he knows what his best position is. Really?

I believe he is trying to impress but he is not good enough to be considered a PL footballer. I would struggle to place him in a championship team looking for promotion. He plays for the club I support but that does not mean he is worth the hype.

re: <b>excellent</b>
Has never happened, will never happen. Just another fact of life.

1455~~~
Is that you Marouane? Or are you high?!

1456~~~
Absolute bollocks. Not good enough for United but don't discredit his great years at Everton.

1457~~~
Can't be used as a DM. Not as CM.  Not a striker and has no skills or vision to be played as a 10... A useless player,  and surely not United material.  Needs to be sold to Sunderland asap..

1458~~~
He's probably not even second or third choice in the positions he's best in on paper, we should sell him in the summer.

1459~~~
He was useless but whole team was, crucial he is sold in the summer along with few others.

1460~~~
My good sir, please what do you define as great because I'm struggling to see it. You are really just overrating performances if you are calling them great years! Tim Cahill did more at Everton than Fellaini and I would not call that great! Lowered standards here.

1461~~~
No.
Just because he had 4 good matches, it doesn't mean he was one of our better players.

1462~~~
Amazing how much people go on about those few games, he was decent overall last season, awful in his first season and has been useless this season. He has been a really bad addition to the squad and a huge waste of money.

1463~~~
That is because haven't watched football long enough to know the difference between a top player and an average player on a purple patch. Benjani, Santa Cruz, Stephen Ireland etc all had fantastic runs in the PL but that doesn't mean they were fantastic players.

1464~~~
He's been a square peg in a round hole ever since he arrived. We're not going to play in a way that gets the best out of him for any real extended periods so we might as well sell him. 

He tries his best and I have a lot of sympathy for him given how unfair a lot of fans have been on him but the reality is he should never have been bought in the first place.

1465~~~
shit

1466~~~
Surprised he was our lowest rated player. I thought he was one of our better performers. He was decent in the first-half but he did fade in the second. I thought Herrera was far worse than him.

*hides from fear of abuse for not praising Herrera*

1467~~~
In each of his three seasons I would argue that he has been at the very least, no worse than the "average" performance of the squad.

Year 1: Under Moyes, the entire team played badly, Fellaini included. One can make a case for mitigating circumstances such as playing the first half of the season a wrist injury, and that he had no preseason (something often used to excuse other players if they do not exactly hit the ground running). These factors are dismissed out of hand by the Fellaini haters (buzz term, but appropriate in this case) of course. On the whole, not really any worse than most of the other outfield players, but an easy target for the fans who didnt want him from day one (amongst other factors such as overpaying, and having a shite midfield which Fellaini was never going to be the solution to).

Year 2: One of our better players over the course of the season. The whole "had 4 good games" claim is just biased revisionism. For much of the season, our best play revolved around the Blind/Fellaini/Young triumvirate on the left hand side, he was usually one of our best performers (ie MotM or close) in the big games against the likes of Chelsea and City, including very good performances in a DM role. Did this despite apparently being on the verge of being sold, and the fans being on his back right from the off.

Year 3: Not utilised much initially by LVG except as an emergency striker. Another victim (certainly not the only one) of the switch to 4-2-3-1 which left him without a really suitable position in the team. We have shown an annoying tendency to employ hoofball when he is on the pitch - which is hardly the players fault but the managers. Nonetheless, in a season where we struggle to score or do anything worthwhile, I would suggest that Fellaini has had more impact and looked more likely to actually impact the game in a positive way than the likes of Mata, Herrera, Memphis (apart from a couple of good games) and Rooney (ditto).

1468~~~
Well said. I really couldn't say it better. LIKE!

Fellaini is not as talented as Rooney, Mata or Herrera, but he wasn't worse than them (and others) this season, on average. I mean, who is really having a good season in the midfield and up front (other than Martial)?

1469~~~
I thought he was good today.

1470~~~
Van Gaal seems to have no idea what Fellaini's strengths are anymore (NOTE TO LVG: It's his sodding chest control, ability to hold up the ball and bring others into play...you feckin' lunatic) ... this after he worked out what they were for a very brief period last season.

It's as if he's just decided to ignore all his findings and do what would lead to being the most shit for both Fellaini and Manchester United... actually, this method could be transferred to most of the things he does as our manager,

1471~~~
Praying AC Milan take him off our hands

1472~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Very good performances at DM, lord have mercy.

Fellaini went on a good run of matches, which pretty much started after a shit match against Arsenal in the FA cup, he was important against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. In there was a shit match against Aston Villa.

Chelsea completely nullified him, he was rubbish against Everton, horrible against West Brom, poor against Crystal Palace but scored the curcial winner. Useless against Arsenal and not sure what to say about his performance against Hull.

1473~~~
He's a poor quality footballer. Are his feet made of wood or something? I'm otherwise struggling to explain how the ball ends up 6 yards away from him every time he tries to control it.

1474~~~
Scholes was completely right, no point playing him in the midfield 2 to dictate the play.

1475~~~
Except he hasnt done that in a while, even at number 10.

The guy was asked to do a job in midfield against a league 1 side. That should not have been beyond him.

1476~~~
Annoy at what seems like ages for him to control the bloody ball and then ages to pass it. He doesn't have the skills to play fast transition football from defence to attack.

1477~~~
Souness destroyed him and LVG on Be In Sports Doha, saying that playing him in central midfield is just madness when he has no awareness of what's going on around him whether it's in attacking or defending situation. Too slow on the ball, not natural and basically pointless.

And these players had much more impressive purple patches than Fellaini.

1478~~~
Yes, and amazingly, he hasn't deviated from that for a <i>single</i> game this season.

1479~~~
Why do we keep playing him in centre mid? He can't dictate play, he can't spread passes, he isn't good with the ball at his feet. He's only effective when he's right up against their centre backs. It's not his fault he's shite there, every fan can see it so why can't the manager?

1480~~~
Yeah. A lot of people wanted him sold in the summer, I wasn't one of them because we saw he can be effective playing in the system you mentioned so was fine with him being a squad option. If we're not going to play that formation anymore then there isn't any point of him being here at all, he's shite in any of the positions in a 4-2-3-1. Actually I'm not sure any of our midfielders can be best utilifrom the current set up, perhaps Schneiderlin aside. Herrera certainly isn't a #10 or a deep lying midfielder, and Carrick and BFS would surely prefer to have the deep lying midfield role to themselves rather than having another player in their space.

1481~~~
His years at Everton count for nothing. He has a few decent games against us, but that's it. The lad is dirt.

1482~~~
Must have been watching a different game because I didn't see that.

1483~~~
Absolute bullshit.

And the revisionism in this thread is hilarious, of course he was one of our best players last season, just like Herrera was. Now both faded into absolute shitness and it's just one of them getting constant flack which is pretty fun to watch.

Best thing is, we won't sell him this window, we probably won't sell him in the summer and he'll still start plenty of games. Enjoy the show.

1484~~~
For much of the season was about half a dozen games at best, four of which he played well in, you couldn't show more blatant biased revisionism if you tried. Other than those games there were some other average and good games but there were more where he was poor or awful. Overall it was an average season, he didn't even get an assist, first season and this season he has been awful, you can dress it up as much as you like but it's true and all he is doing this season is ensuring he gets sold.

1485~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So, let me get this straight. Not only is he not good enough for United (which is fair enough despite him being one of our best players in several of our big games last season which is now conveniently ignored), he's also not premier league quality and he wouldn't even get into the better Championship. Complete and utter drivel.

Quite possibly the worst post in this thread which says something given the general standard of this thread.

1486~~~
He didnt play that badly last night. He was much better than Mata and Herrera. He got into good positions and didnt give away many fouls and even passed well. Some comments are way over the top. However, I dont see him in our plans. Him moving would be best for everyone i guess

1487~~~
It happened a couple of times yesterday but it was more of a general observation.

1488~~~
Just let him go to Milan and throw perreria in feck it

1489~~~
I am not a fan of his but to be fair he was OK last night, I think most fans are dreaming of the United of old, remember ? The one that blitzed teams for 90 minutes (+Fergie time) he certainly would'nt get in an 'all time best XI' but at least he plays for the team which sadly some don't

1490~~~
Him being rated below Herrera and Mata yesterday is ridiculous.

1491~~~
Fellaini is such a handful to play against when he's utilised properly. I honeslty think we're using him wrongly and not playing to his strengths.

We saw that when he was playing for Everton, but also over the last few years for Belgium where he has been one of their key, and most influential players even ahead of the likes of Hazard, De Bruyne and Lukaku.

1492~~~
Wish we'd go back to last season's 4-1-4-1 which was so effective with Fellaini and Herrera as attacking midfielders linking up with either Memphis/Young or Mata/Lingard on the wings. 

Our little triangles were so good!

1493~~~
In our first games against Chelsea and City he played at DM. MotM again Chelsea, 2nd highest against City (when Smalling got sent off). This came after coming on for basically his first appearance of the season the previous week against West Ham (?) where he scored the winner for us.

During this period in the first half of the season he went on a subsequent run in the team and was comfortably one of our best players. This is before Christmas. Dont believe me? Go read the match threads or some of the fellaini related threads for that period. Or alternatelt keep your head in the sand and keep spouting the same tripe as half of the caf.

Of course all this can be quickly brushed under the rug because "HES SHIT REALLLY <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> LOLOL", right?

1494~~~
This is definitely the best system we've had under Van Gaal. Bizarre that he decided to abandon it after having his only genuinely impressive spell using that formation.

1495~~~
Feel bad for him.

Scholes was bang on yesterday, the mans game is to be a target in the oppositions.

Moyes & LVG are both playing him as a fecking central midfielder.

1496~~~
Yeah. Probably Fellainis biggest weakness is his lack of positional discipline. I do think he is under instruction to get forward regularly, but it was much more balanced last year with the 4-3-3 when he had a dedicated holding midfielder behind him, allowing Fellaini to operate more freely, closing down defenders, getting forward and basically playing box to box. Same applies to Herrera.
Similarly when he was deployed as a DM, it was more of a man marking job than a true holding midfield role that he was in.

1497~~~
No, he didn't play defensive midfield against Chelsea. Daley Blind was the holding midfielder, with Fellaini being the one with freedom to go forward. Same against City. And no, he didn't score the winner for us against West Ham the week before the Chelsea match, he scored the 1-1 goal against West Bromwich.

You can't even get the basics right...Which pretty much explains the rest of your gobshite.

He's a £30mill bog brush.

1498~~~
Chasing down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The only thing he has ever chased down, is the ball he ran over the sideline against Bayern

In general, Fellaini struggles when it comes to keeping pressure on opponents, that combined with his positional deficiency makes him pretty much as useless as it gets as a central midfielder with the slightest defensive responsibility. His overview and passing ability isn't exactly an impressive feature either.  

Forking out close to £30mill for an Everton player like Fellaini, lord have mercy. They are still laughing...

1499~~~
Against Chelsea he won MotM and his main job was shackling Fabregas - this being at a time when Chelsea were rampant and free-scoring.

Against City he was again one of our best players.

Against West Brom he came on and scored - whether it was the winner or securing the draw is largely irrelevant and just another attempt to try to downplay his impact.

Your second post clearly shows the level of delusion and bias you have (like numerous others on here), I imagine you were one of the same cretins booing him in preseason that year (another time when he came off the bench and scored a vital goal).

1500~~~
£27.5mill.

You can't even get the basics right...Which pretty much explains the rest of your gobshite.

1501~~~
If an offer comes in for him in the January window, the club should bite their hand off. This is coming for someone who rates the guy, but he's not right for this club.

1502~~~
Diego Costa was out injured so they had to start with Drogba (who did score). Man marking an opposition player isn't the same as being a defensive midfielder. People are still wanking off to Phil Jones man marking Cristiano Ronaldo...

Best players is an overstatement, which is being used to make it sound like a player has performed better, when the truth is that as a team we played mediocre and it was an mediocre season overall. Did Fellaini stand out as a good player or as a bad player, no.

The point wasn't that he didn't come on and score, the point was that your claim about opponent and result was incorrect.

I don't boo him. I'd love for him to improve as a player and show that he's worth the insane amount of money we forked out for him. But i'm realistic, and Fellaini isn't anywhere close to being good enough for a top club.

We never should've signed him. People are still going on about one performance he had for Everton against us, when we allowed him to roam between midfield and defence. Next time we met Everton we had Tom Cleverley and Anderson run rings around him..Players have decent performances against us from time to time, it happens.

1503~~~
I assume he gets paid like the rest of the players.

1504~~~
That's rich coming from you.

Oxymoron much?  Walrus will be telling his grandchildren about Fellaini's 3 game purple patch of 2015.

1505~~~
He's more a symbol of the problem than the problem itself. Play him up front and we end up almost exclusively targeting him, which is obvious and easy to defend. Play him as a defensive mid and we end up with isolated attackers. The 4-1-4-1 really was the best use of his size and strength to the team's benefit without reducing him to simply just a crossing target.

1506~~~
Paint it however you wish, he was MotM, and when Fellaini wins MotM even on bloody Redcafe then you know he played well.


Most unbiased sources will say that yes, Fellaini did stand out as one of our best players. This is because we played much better with him in the team than out of it, our results reflected that for the vast majority of the season, and he was usually integral to our best performances. If memory serves, when he was out of the team due to injury around Christmas time we failed to score for three games.

I cant really be bothered to make a big list of links here, but one typical example from last season from this thread is <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-15-performances.394651/page-142#post-17351810">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-15-performances.394651/page-142#post-17351810</a> - the game against Man City in April (which was apparently when he was shit again according to some)

Well thats a bit of a stupid point. I even put a "?" after West Ham because I couldnt remember whether it was them or another team (ie WBA), and the point was that he came on and scored.

I dont think it is a case of "never should have signed him" but rather that the circumstances around his transfer were ludicrous for several reasons -
*We desperately needed a midfield revamp, and it was fairly obvious that Fellaini was never going to be the answer to that.
*We overpaid, especially when considering his release clause.
*He was bought from Moyes' old club, which straight away riled some fans who were concerned that he was trying to turn us into Everton.

We needed other midfielders that summer, not [just] Fellaini - but it is unfair to hold this against Fellaini, which is what many fans seem to do.  Re: his performances at Everton though, you are way off the mark and most actual Everton fans will tell you that he was consistently one of their best players over several years, including time as a CM and as a #10. I hope <a class="username" data-user="48226, @SilentWitness" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48226/">@SilentWitness</a> and <a class="username" data-user="87357, @BigDunc9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87357/">@BigDunc9</a> dont mind me tagging them here to maybe share their thoughts in this area.

1507~~~
Well, i'd prefer to paint the correct picture. Your claim was that he had a man of the match performance playing as a defensive midfielder. Considering he's never had a solid match as a defensive midfielder for us, probably not even close to a good performance, i'd say it's pretty far off the wall to claim he delivered a man of the match performance as a DM..

Not entirely sure about the insane focus on a man of the match performance (voted by Redcafe members nonetheless) either, the claim isn't that he's never played a good match, the claim is that overall he's not good enough for us. We'll probably be able to dig up a man of the match performance by Kleberson, maybe Djemba Djemba as well. Pop the fecking champagne.

Most unbiased sources <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ...Considering the amount of matches he was involved in, he's bound to be involved in nice wins, lucky wins, bad losses, losses we didn't deserve and so on. He had three matches where he stood out and played consistently well, that's the three matches at the end of the season against Tottenham, City and Liverpool. He was certainly involved when we got dominated against Chelsea, dominated by Everton, dominated by Southampton, Swansea. He was involved in 7/8 league defeats. It's probably easy to find someone that wasn't involved in the big defeats, but who was involved in the decent wins, and paint a picture that said player was integral to our good performances. 


The point is that you always seem to overdo things. Coming on to score a winner against West Ham certainly sounds a bit more nice than coming on and scoring the 1-1 goal in a 2-2 draw (where Blind scored the equaliser at the end of the match) against WBA


It had nothing to do with who he was purchased from, or the theory that he was turning us into Everton, the issue was that Fellaini wasn't someone we needed.




We didn't need Fellaini, at all.

It's mint that he was one of their best players over several years.  Good for him. Doesn't make him good enough for us, doesn't make him an important signing for us, doesn't improve his performances for us.

1508~~~
He is not a United player, get rid as soon as possible, he is the residual left after gollum and is a reminder of that shite.

1509~~~
No revisionism with me. Never wanted him at Utd, still don't. If you think he would get a sniff at any other top team in Europe, you're as delusional as Van Gaal.

1510~~~
Umm, probably goes something like "thanks for the dough suckers"?

1511~~~
You are just trying to play the good guy here. Please tell me how Fellaini fit into or transform any club in the PL or at the top of the championship? You want to use the 4 game run that he was decent in, have you considered the next 3 games after? He was as bad as I have ever seen a PL player.

1512~~~
No he wouldn't, I never said that but that doesn't in any way erase what he's done last season. If you can't tell the difference between the two you're as delusional as LVG.

1513~~~
He's never, ever, <i>really </i>looked like he belongs here. He has his defenders on here but I don't think many of them would complain much if he handed in a transfer request to Milan tomorrow.

1514~~~
Good guy? I don't care about Fellaini and couldn't care less if he got sold tomorrow. But anyone suggesting that he's not PL quality needs to get their head checked. He was a very good player for an Everton side that regularly competed for a top  spot.. And it was more than just 4 games btw.

1515~~~
He scored 6 goals last season and was par for the course but his followers want to make it seem like he had a great season. He'd probably be more suited to another team and im pretty sure he's not happy with his playing time especially after what Marc Wilmots said about players without minutes being an 'annoyance'.

1516~~~
I'd probably sell him in the summer because you'd want someone more gifted coming off the bench at a club like Manchester United. But he's not really that big a part of the problem given he's not a first choice starter which is where our problems lie. Fellaini only becomes this giant issue when he's backup to a rubbish attack.

1517~~~
Should never play as a DM. Ponderous, slow on the ball, gives fouls and the ball away. Shades of why he got so much stick under Moyes. Needs to play further up the pitch.

1518~~~
Also integral in our goal

1519~~~
4 fouls in 23 mins <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1520~~~
He's a juggernaut at aerial balls. Sam Allardyce would love him at centre back.

1521~~~
Bumbling oaf.

1522~~~
Never a booking

1523~~~
Integral in the goal, should arguably have had another penalty (defender just dives across him, should be obstruction) and his touch just now led to the Rooney chance that should have been a goal.

Haters gonna hate...

1524~~~
Very good so far.

1525~~~
To have a goalkeeper and Fellaini defending set pieces in your own box is almost unfair to the opposition when they play it high.

1526~~~
of course it's a booking. he's already been warned what... three times?

1527~~~
Why is he hauling back an opposition player just outside the box when he's already on a yellow? His discipline is woeful.

1528~~~
Nice assist for their goal.

1529~~~
Been a walking disaster today in this role

1530~~~
It's embarrassing to watch him play. He's absolutely shite

1531~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1532~~~
Harsh to blame him for that. He was providing some defensive cover since Smalling wasn't in the box.

1533~~~
Warick Davis is more of a threat in the air than this lad

1534~~~
Haters gonna hate, eh.

1535~~~
Yup

1536~~~
He did cause the start of the goal with a limp pass to Rooney. He can't hit a weighted pass to save his life.

Tragic from him today.

1537~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1538~~~
He probably needs to come off at half-time. It's been a mixed game for him; he's actually been useful on occasion defensively and offered cover for their 2nd goal even if it proved futile, but his discipline is worryingly bad. He could end up with a red card at this rate, and I'm not sure it's a risk we should be taking.

1539~~~
Never realised that, will need to go back and have a look at their goal again. It was well worked from them, in all fairness, so I wouldn't place <i>too </i>much blame on him for it. His horrendous discipline is by far the bigger issue.

1540~~~
He is one of the dumbest players I have ever seen, seems to play with zero intelligence, tonight his all round play has been poor but he has had some effective moments.

1541~~~
He's so off the pace, should be off and heads it straight to Wijnaldum for their goal.

1542~~~
Without saying anything about the rest of his performance, he does give away the ball for their goal, and should have won the header in the box because he just had to stand his ground.

1543~~~
Buying your kid a United top with Fellaini at the back is bad parenting!

1544~~~
Has he ever scored from a corner for us?

1545~~~
May have done today if not for the defender using his hand to block the shot, for all we know.

1546~~~
The keeper was right there, pretty much no chance it'd have gone in.

1547~~~
Should've done better with the header but unlucky it landed exactly where it did. 

But my word he's a total fecking idiot. Can't defend properly for shit

1548~~~
If we feel like we need him purely from a defensive point of view - that is tragic. 

But it's all I can come up with, because having him attempting to pass it 10 yards, or turn a man in the circle is like watching non-league player. When we have the ball he's so, so poor.

1549~~~
That tug on a Newcastle player while on a yellow card just sums him up. Absolutely no intelligence, reckless player who doesn't provide enough to make up for his shortcomings.

1550~~~
Can't stand this prick. Needless fouls and weak as piss. Never a United player and an embarrassment.

1551~~~
Aye, for as much of a bombscare as he's been, I actually think it's quite harsh to blame him for that because he'd gone back to provide some cover and just tried to head it away in the moment. Smalling's away more at fault, although even then I wouldn't blame him too much because it was an excellent goal.

1552~~~
So he won us a penalty, started a break from which Rooney should have scored, and could have had another penalty (but was booked instead bizarrely).

On their goal he can definitely do better, but he is doing the right thing by going back to defend and helping Blind against Mitrovic. The majority of the blame lies on Smalling for not tracking the runner (and I am a big Smalling fan).

Of course, once again this leads to the Fellaini thread being laden with insults and comments about how he is apparently stupid, the worst player ever to play for us, a disgrace, an embarrassment to the shirt and all the usual shite. If he scored a hattrick most people would still probably rate him a grudging 5/10.

1553~~~
Only an idiot would think he's a central midfielder after the last 7.5 years in the Premier League. He's slow, is technically poor, has an awful passing range, has bad fitness and is positionally indisciplined. 

I can't think of a single quality that that would make anyone think he's a central midfielder. He's a Tony Pulis style supporting forward or plan B striker. That's what we paid £27m for.

1554~~~
Aye, that was completely bizarre. Couldn't believe what he was doing. A lot of his fouls are really, really unnecessary too. The fact that the ref's given him a yellow presumably for a collection of small offences shows he'll probably be willing to do the same in the 2nd half if it continues.

1555~~~
He did win us a penalty to be fair...

1556~~~
In his very slight defence... he is not being helped by his midfield partner at all. Also, his booking was a complete joke.

Not that he's been good or anything, but yeah.

1557~~~
He's an eyesore as a CM. Can't make a weighted pass and doesn't have any brain cells.

1558~~~
As in he should have been booked about 20 minutes before that?

1559~~~
I agree with you on most of that (certainly don't blame him for the header because he was providing defensive cover), but most of the complaints about him are completely legit. I notice that you've completely ignored his disciplinary issues, because the booking was for a collection of offences, and I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that he should've been getting a penalty from. His hauling back a Newcastle player just after the half hour when he was on a yellow sums up his horrendous discipline. He's been <i>okay</i>; certainly had worse games, but there's a genuine risk that he's going to get sent off in the second half.

1560~~~
You'd have a point if everything else he's done in this match weren't so brain dead. He's passed it to no one, lost possession numerous times in the heart of midfield, committed 4 fouls in the first 20 minutes and then didn't let it stop him fouling some more. 

I think most fans gave him the benefit of the doubt last season when he scored some important goals for us and was a good option, but he's been completely awful every time I've seen him this season. When he plays, the whole team plays poorly, and the results bear that out. Add in the fact that despite being massive he is weak on the ball and that most of his fouls are snide...there's just not much to love.

1561~~~
nah, he should have been booked 10 minutes after it!

1562~~~
He's been no worse than Schneiderlin, to be honest. He sticks out more because he actually actively participates in the game. Both been poor though.

1563~~~
Fellaini's actual foul for the yellow should've been an indirect free kick in the box for us.
Unless you're allowed to dive in front of the ball and obstruct play these days.

1564~~~
No he didn't, Mbemba's decision did

1565~~~
Inexplicably out of his depth at this level.

1566~~~
Really frustrating to see him play these days

1567~~~
Cant think of a thing he's done right today. He's been shocking.

1568~~~
Whats the point, really?

1569~~~
I might have said this before, but he's shit. Tiote won a header against him, because the daft tit wants to stand still and chest the ball down...

1570~~~
He has had a few fouls yes. I don't think he should have been booked when he was, and the whole "pulling back" incident is just being overstated because it's Fellaini and on a yellow.

1571~~~
How's it being overstated when had the ref called him on it we could've easily been down to 10 men with over 45 mins to go? It was inexplicably reckless.

1572~~~
Yup it was reckless.

1573~~~
Never has been and never will be a remotely good enough midfielder. He's incapable of the basics required to play there.

1574~~~
Just hit a great ball to Rooney that the latter should have scored from, then defended excellently in the box against Colback.


Cue lots of "he is shit" comments?

1575~~~
The tackle was very good, but the ball was just fine; decent, aye, but Rooney was in plenty of space and it'd have been a bit shit from him if he didn't get it to Rooney. And despite Rooney's pathetic attempt, it was hardly a clear-cut chance.

1576~~~
If that wasn't a clear cut chance then our standards must definitely be slipping. A good striker would have scored from that.

1577~~~
He still had to take it past his man. Pathetic attempt, aye, but not a definite goal.

And besides, the pass from Fellaini, which was your main point I presume, was fine. It was decent, but nothing particularly special considering the amount of space Rooney was in.

1578~~~
Fellaini and Schneiderlin absolutely invisible at the minute. Midfield being walked through.

1579~~~
The moment we were linked with Fellaini during Moyes era, I said that he is only good at being a targetman or a suffoco and he is not a midfielder. I still stand by that 100%

1580~~~
How does he survive?

1581~~~
Rock it wasn't a Paul Scholes 60 yarder, but better than you give credit for I think - you often see those sorts of passes overhit (keeper comes and collects) or underhit (intercepted or attack loses momentum). I imagine if Herrera or Mata had played it, it would be considered a good ball.

1582~~~
It'd be considered for what it was: an okay, well weighted forward hit that any good midfielder should ideally be pulling off.

1583~~~
He's shit.

1584~~~
Nice to see him continuing his fine form of missing sitters.

1585~~~
I'll be called a hater now for saying he should have scored there. For such a tall lummox he is dismal in the air.

1586~~~
He's useless. Honestly.

1587~~~
Should have buried that. Great cross.

1588~~~
Needs to be burying that header.

1589~~~
Sabotaging us.

1590~~~
Haterrrrrrr.

1591~~~
Aye, needs to be scoring that, although not the only great chance wasted tonight.

1592~~~
Well that certainly makes him better...

1593~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1594~~~
how can someone as tall as he is be so bad at heading? (both defensively and offensively)

1595~~~
Woeful player. Selling him would be a great January window.

1596~~~
So bad today.

1597~~~
Just why?

1598~~~
Since it's the Fellaini thread it will get mentioned in here, naturally enough.

1599~~~
Of course, and rightly so. The only defence I will offer is that at least he is still making those forward runs into the box in the 85th or so minute, but needs to be scoring it.

1600~~~
Misses an absolute sitter, has a shit match, Newcastle then make it 3-3 and it's 2 lost points.

Walrus still loving Fellaini

1601~~~
As much as it's a poor miss, I'd say that blaming him for losing two points on the basis of that alone is probably a <i>bit </i>harsh, considering Lingard's miss, errors at the back for the opposition goals etc.

1602~~~
Fellaini misses a sitter every single game.

1603~~~
Despise him. He's epitomises whats wrong with football. Joke of a player.

1604~~~
Well looks an important miss now. Horrendous header. Himself and Lingard have missed absolute sitters in the one match we actually create chances. Infuriating.

1605~~~
Agreed

1606~~~
Remnant of the Moyes era.

What's he still doing here ?

1607~~~
Do not want.

1608~~~
Bolton player

1609~~~
I can't have him playing for us anymore. Get rid

1610~~~
Sell the twat.

1611~~~
Giant cnut

1612~~~
Clumsy feck. Cannot defend. Headless chicken. I still cannot believe he lasted the 90 mins. And again misses an absolute sitter. Get rid.

1613~~~
Oh dear.

1614~~~
Wasted height. Useless player.

1615~~~
fecking bin him. Would've been better off if he did get sent off

1616~~~
The one thing he's good at, heading the fecking ball, and he can't score from 3 yards out.

1617~~~
He misses a sitter like that literally every single game. 

That's not even an exaggeration, it's every game. Yet he keeps getting played and he never has the manager having a fit in his seat in reaction. 

Get. The. feck. Rid.

1618~~~
Fvcking hate him, hate his hair and hate his clumsy are style in our midfield. Actually think the fact he was on a yellow from 20 minutes cost us, he couldn't put himself into tackles which surrendered possession. 

I'm sick of the sight of him.

1619~~~
He's not good at it though. It's a myth.

1620~~~
Hey <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> mate how it's going.

1621~~~
He's shit at heading. Always has been for us.

1622~~~
Absolutely awful, should never be starting. He's a walking red card and it'll be at it's worst at anfield when the crowd are baying for blood.

1623~~~
I don't get what he does as a midfielder. He doesn't hold off players or seem to really win aerial balls. All round bad game and the sitter just made it a whole lot worse.

1624~~~
LVG off, he's so fecking stupid its unbelievable, why the hell would you play fellaini there, he cant cover shit, absolutely useless, why does he play in midfield why does he play? we can blame lingard and rooney for their chances but fellaini header was just 100% just hit the ball to the ground not the scared goalkeeper... I have no more words..

1625~~~
Should be a priority to get rid of him, tried to give him chances but I think he causes more problems than he solves. He's like keeping unhealthy convenient food at home, its a bad easy solution which ultimately makes things worse.

1626~~~
He's good at it when he's in a defensive position and the balls coming towards him with no one challenging him so he can let it bob off his head. Which is only the case because he's massive. When he's called upon to actually use it in a pressure situation he's worryingly average for someone who's supposed to have it as one of his big attributes.

1627~~~
After today's miss, I can't argue with that.

1628~~~
He's absolutely terrible at everything.

1629~~~
Poor but, don't think LVG is using him well

1630~~~
stupid thread....

1631~~~
Never mind the miss, he was garbage. It's alarming our worst midfield performance of the season sees us create the most chances for a while.

1632~~~
VG was going to use him as a no.9 this season.

What's the point of him? For a big guy he's shit aerially.

1633~~~
Had enough. How he starts so many games for us I will never know.

1634~~~
How can we, Manchester United, be playing with this guy? It was such a shocking performance and the fact he wasn't taken off leads me to believe Louis van Gaal is probably the most stupid manager in the league. There was a lot of evidence pointing to that with conntiued reliance on defenders who aren't defenders, attackers who can't score, etc etc.

1635~~~
Fingers crossed he won't play Sunday, was all over the place and can't do what to is required in that position.

1636~~~
Honestly, everyone is good in those situations. I know exactly what you mean though <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1637~~~
Can we start a Kickstarter to buy him for AC Milan if they want him?  I'd pay money to never see him in a United shirt again.  If I win the lottery tomorrow night, I'll give them the money.

1638~~~
I refuse to believe this man is a professional footballer.

A circus freak yes, but footballer he is not.

1639~~~
Lahm beat him in the air and lahm is a midget.

1640~~~
Good luck in Milan.

1641~~~
Awful player. I dread seeing him in the lineup.

1642~~~
This guy is a crime against humanity.

1643~~~
I normally don't like criticising our own players and try to look for the positives, but there aren't any. He's nothing more than a plan B target-man up top when we're struggling for a goal. As an actual footballer we badly need to replace him.

Disastrous, overpriced gift from Moyes.

1644~~~
It was a sitter but I'm amazed he still managed to be on the pitch by that point after 4 fouls in like the first 20 minutes.

1645~~~
Another proud day for him. All of his supposed strengths could be performed far better by players who could add much more otherwise.

1646~~~
Seriously, sell him. He's not good enough, caused their first goal and missed a chance I would score. feck off already.

1647~~~
Terrible player. Does very little that is positive. How he lasted 90 minutes is beyond me.

1648~~~
Supposed to be good in the air, yet he's abysmal at it. All he did with his head was to head it down for a Newcastle goal and miss a sitter of a header. The worst DM/#8 we have in our squad. Would rather play Pearson and we've sold him for 100k.

1649~~~
But Lahm is superman.

1650~~~
Same old, same old.

1651~~~
Why does he play for us at all?

1652~~~
4 fouls in 23 minutes <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
Heads the ball down for their equalizer
Beaten in the air so often
Broke down two of our attacks
Dispossessed so many times
Underhit passes galore

He's like that kid in school, who you don't pick for your team because he's fecking awful

1653~~~
He has missed like six of these crucial sitters in the past months. He could have gotten us at least 5-8 points more.

1654~~~
Other than maybe Anderson.

Has to be the worst signing we've ever made. fecking dogshit player.

1655~~~
Weak as piss. He offers us nothing.

1656~~~
Please make a bid Milan I'm begging you

1657~~~
Aye, what I'm saying is that, essentially, he's only rated at all for his heading because of his size.

1658~~~
Hope he's booted out of football permanently. He's a huge discredit to the game. Ugly playing style and a circus freak

1659~~~
He must be amongst the worst things to ever happen football.

1660~~~
Integral in the opening goal and almost got this foul one time but he got booked instead and then did a pass. You're all haters

1661~~~
The only thing positive about Fellaini these days, is that this is his last season at the club..

1662~~~
I can't wait till someone reminds us of his 4 game run almost a year ago!

1663~~~
Which is incredibly stupid when you think about it. A player who is good in the air and tall is Andy Carroll.

1664~~~
If you want to be fair to him today I would call it very much a mixed bag

I thought he was quite good at times very poor at others

1665~~~
He is unbelievably awful. Beggars belief how he still gets starts. Whatever Milan are offering, take it and sell him.

1666~~~
He's probably improved a lot now, but I actually used to think Carroll had similar problems to Fellaini back in the day; better at getting his head to it due to his size than due to actual heading ability.

1667~~~
Seriously what LVG seeing him? He he just can't score, can't defend, what's the point of him in team? 
He should never play for us.

1668~~~
Actually thought he was mostly good defensively but a donkey on the ball.

1669~~~
He's absolutely woeful and needs to feck off out of the club. He's shit at all the things he's supposed to be good at and worse at the rest. I want him fired out of a cannon.

1670~~~
I think you have come to the wrong thread, my friend.

1671~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1672~~~
Played the second half with ten men pretty much.

1673~~~
jogs around all match as if it is not too important, fouls a lot, has 4 elbows, and is not even too good in the air. Tends to wait for the ball to arrive instead of going towards it. Get rid.

1674~~~
He has. I've seen much better use of his body to position himself before jumping for the ball. Fellaini lacks the positioning, the fighting spirit and the heading ability.

1675~~~
Funnily enough, I'll be honest and say that while I thought he <i>was </i>very poor, I probably feel like he did better than some others...his rating seems to be averaging at 3.2 at the moment and I've got him above that...even if not by a lot. But aye, despite the positives he occasionally offered, the negatives are often just too worrying and too costly for us.

1676~~~
I beg to differ. Anderson played some good football in his time here, more times than Fellaini. He had more to his game than Fellaini would ever have

1677~~~
has to go.

1678~~~
How he stayed on the pitch is beyond me. We will always struggle to hold onto the ball when he is centre mid. i can see uses for him further up the pitch but tonight he shouldn't have stayed on the pitch for the full 90

1679~~~
He is not good enough for us. I hope to see <b>Pereira</b> in that position and Schweinsteiger when he recovers.

1680~~~
Aye, Anderson's first season was good and he looked quite promising for a few years. Fellaini's been a bit of a shit signing, but I'd still say Bebe and Obertan probably rank as worse.

1681~~~
The missed sitter is only half the problem. When he was playing deeper in midfield he couldn't control the ball of win challenges. He's poor in every position.

1682~~~
We should be actively looking to sell him. And Van Gaal should stop using him, he was decent last season but overall simply isn't a United player.

1683~~~
Contrary to popular belief, my mission objective isnt to defend Fellaini at all costs - it is simply to try to actually give the guy fair treatment like any other player. You need only read the comments on the last page or so here to (hopefully) see what I mean.

1684~~~
Can we pay Milan 20m to take him

1685~~~
Whilst I think it's laudable that we're doing our bit for whatever charity represents him, I think it's time to stop playing Fellaini.

1686~~~
Cost us nowhere near as much though.

1687~~~
That didn't happen. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1688~~~
Playing him in that position is a disaster.

1689~~~
Apart from that one ball which freed Rooney up, what exactly was he good at? Genuine question because all I saw was clumsy fouls, awful passing, zero ability in the air and another sitter missed.

1690~~~
Probably, but some of the defences of him have been a <i>bit </i>frivolous. I'd say it was probably about a 5/10 performance, but his horrendous discipline made me opt for a harsher 4 - his habit of making stupid fouls in unnecessary areas borders on unforgivable at times. He's certainly had worse games for us this season.

1691~~~
He is awful and misses to many big chances.

1692~~~
Worst player to ever get consistent playing time for Manchester United? He's the worst I can remember anyway.

1693~~~
True. Fellaini at least had a decent 2014/2015, which isn't much I'll admit considering what he cost.

1694~~~
He used his presence well at times in both boxes and was combative in midfield

1695~~~
Aye, he's getting absolutely ripped into. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1696~~~
I would say fair treatment of him tonight would be to say that he was only marginally better then Morgan Schneiderlin next to him (who was absolutely feckin' abject) - only because he was actually trying to get involved in the game... but generally whenever he did get involved, he was really poor.

1697~~~
Yep, plodded along nicely last season and made a huge nuisance of himself many times. These days it's like watching the first season version of him again. Get rid.

1698~~~
LVG has misused him this season in all honesty.

That said, I don't think Fellaini is good enough for the level we wish to return to.

1699~~~
He cleared the ball off corners when completely unchallenged and fouled nonstop in midfield. If that passes for having quite a few good things in the match, our standards have well and truly hit rock bottom.

1700~~~
I gave him a 6 tonight, myself. That said, my average rating on pretty much every player is higher than the caf average (my average for tonights players was 6.2). He effectively won the penalty for us, spent a lot of time trying to help Blind at the back as Mitrovic was obviously (and rightly) targeting him for a physical matchup. He started the move that led to Rooney's missed 1-on-1 in the first half, and could have had an assist to Rooney in the second (as we previously discussed). He also - in my opinion - could have won another penalty on the incident where he somehow ended up getting booked.

On the negatives, he was partially responsible for one of their goals (though the majority of the blame is with Smalling) and he missed a sitter which he should have scored from, as well as making quite a few fouls.

On the whole for me, not a great performance, perhaps not even a 'good' one - hence I gave him a 6. Quite a stark contrast from a lot of the comments here, and of course the average rating.

1701~~~
This. I'll take £10m

1702~~~
Ah come on fella! You are just pushing it now

1703~~~
Amazing how many sitters he manages to miss. He's such a fecking shite player, amazing how he plays so much. Its purely because he's tall, which is ridiculous.

1704~~~
Oh piss off.  You've appointed yourself defender of all things Fellaini.  The useless lump deserves all the stick that he gets.

1705~~~
I thought LvG had hit something when he started playing with some subtlety and smartness last season. That's disappeared and tonight was reminiscent of 13/14 where he was a liability.

1706~~~
He is not a center mid nor a defensive one. We have much better atrackers than him, so he needs to be sold. I do not mind to see the Wig playing, however, it baffles me to see him playing asa defensive mid when he has zero ability to read the game and position himself accordingly.

1707~~~
If I was as tall as him, and I was that bad at heading the ball, I'd be (here comes the "e" word) embarrassed.

1708~~~
The penalty is a bit subjective: he didn't really <i>win </i>it for us. He just happened to get his head to the ball, and we were then awarded a very contentious penalty for a handball. If I'm being kind, I'd give him it as some sort of credit, but it's still quite minor.

I'll give him some props for having the nous to cover at the back sometimes, but it's largely negated for his general positioning problems, and the fact that him and Schneiderlin were often being walked through in midfield.

I still don't think his potential assist for Rooney was <i>that </i>great. It was an okay pass, but Rooney still had to do a lot of work. He essentially made a decent pass to someone in a forward position...which is exactly the bare minimum you expect from a midfielder.

And the worst part of his game was probably his woeful discipline. I know I keep coming back to it, but it really can't be overstated as to how costly his fouls can be, especially once he was booked. There was a real danger of him ending up with a red card because of how needlessly reckless he is.

1709~~~
pretty much dared the ref to send him off tonight

1710~~~
Not that I think he's good enough for United but I don't think he played as bad today as some are making out. Missed a huge chance and some silly tackles, but much worse performers out there today. Covered for Schneiderlin and our defenders several times.

1711~~~
I think some players that didn't come off the bench tonight played better than Schneiderlin.

1712~~~
Awww, I was hoping for euthanised.

1713~~~
Not sure why he keeps being played as CM, hes not a CM. Id rather have Shelvey than him there.

1714~~~
Fork out that 20 million Euros Milan you stingy feckers.

1715~~~
Nothing player...  Does nothing well..  Misses sitters every game and sadly playing him in midfield always costs us dearly.  Please just send him to Milan asap, I can't watch him playing for us anymore.

1716~~~
Won his headers well and made a couple of decent tackles, but he offers nothing on the ball in midfield and can't track a run properly at all, plus he missed a sitter tonight.

1717~~~
I dont see it as contentious. I realise it isnt as clearcut as when Memphis or Young dribbles into the box and goes down, but realistically if Fellaini isnt there in the right position to have an attempt on goal, the defender doesnt really need to make the handball/foul. It was a definite pen for me - the amount of credit you give to Fellaini is debatable for sure, but I think you can still chalk it down in the "positives" column for his game tonight.

I said not long ago on here that I think positional discipline is probably Fellaini's single biggest weakness. That said, we are unlikely to know exactly how much of this sort of thing comes down to instruction from LVG, and how much is natural instinct. Fellaini clearly is instructed to get into the opponents box to try to challenge on crosses - he nearly scored from it (and yes, <i>should</i> have scored from it) tonight. On another night people would be calling that indiscipline and chiding him for not saying back in a holding role.
Similarly tonight I felt it was noticeable that he was getting back to support Blind regularly against Mitrovic. To me this looked like another clear instruction from LVG which Fellaini (presumably) carried out. Ultimately the guy is a box to box player and doesnt fit into any of the midfield positions in a 4-2-3-1 very well - much like Herrera. You can blame him for this, or blame LVG for changing the system and then playing him in an ill-suited role (most of this also applies to Herrera).

It wasnt great but a chance is a chance. I thought it was a good chance for Rooney, and he [Rooney] dealt with it absolutely horribly - and combined with his earlier miss it was almost enough for me to downgrade his rating and go for someone else as MotM. I am pretty sure that if you have an Aguero, Sanchez, Hazard, Wijnaldum to name but a few, in that situation, you at the very minimum get a good shot on target and force a save.

I agree on most of this and was surprised that LVG didnt take him off for/in the second half. I do think that some of it is being exaggerated because its Fellaini though - for example the incident where he picked up his booking, was absolutely not a foul and if anything was a clear obstruction by the defender.

1718~~~
Being able to head the ball well is a lot more than just having an advantage because you're tall. Some of the best headerers (sic) in an offensive sense were/are midgets.

1719~~~
And yet Schneiderlin's rating is a full 50% higher than Fellaini's tonight.

1720~~~
And gave away the ball on the edge of our box directly leading to conceding a goal. And was lucky not to get sent off for repeated, stupid fouls.

1721~~~
But it's not that he's even decent at heading the ball... he's actively crap at it. I mean, he doesn't even jump for the ball or win battles in the air very well.

1722~~~
I blame that wing, it can't help.

1723~~~
He's crap at heading. Chest control is his best asset bizarrely.

1724~~~

1725~~~
Just pay them that amount to take him

1726~~~
feck me...someone post this to Carrington ASAP!

1727~~~
He has great chest control, he is big and awkward but other than that is lacking in every other area and skill set required to perform the role he was asked to play tonight, a really bad performance as has been the case in pretty much every game he has played this season, we are a worse team when he plays simple as that.

1728~~~
Why do people keep saying he won his headers? 

He got beaten to every challenged header he actually had. I saw players like Perez beating him in the air.

1729~~~
For the measly sum of £15 million, I would personally drop off Fellaini to Milan myself in my VW Polo.

1730~~~
It's not only his lack of technical ability that astonishes me but also his lack of intelligence on the field.

1731~~~
There really is no excuse for playing him so much. He has something he can offer but it's crazy how much game time we give him. He's just not got enough quality to play there. He's literally in the team for his height alone and it's not enough. Should be Herrera in there with Schniederlin in a game like this.

1732~~~
He makes me wanna join a club again. Still 22, who knows. This guy gets wayyy too much game time.

1733~~~
I already said if I win the lottery tomorrow night I'll pay it for them if you don't mind driving.

1734~~~
If Paddy Evra and Fellaini competed for a ball in the air, I'd back Evra to win it 99 times out of 100.

1735~~~
Amazing for someone so tall that he's complete shit at headers as well. His only good thing is chesting the ball down basically. Crazy that he's even at a club like united, let alone getting so much playing time. Will be genuinely delighted when hes sold

1736~~~
Deal! Can you cover the service stop breaks as well? I'll cover petrol. Cheers. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1737~~~
Is chesting even a skill? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1738~~~
West brom
West ham
Norwich
Newcastle
All chances where he must score with just keeper to beat and he hits it straight at the keeper. Its fecking ridiculous.
He and Lingard have coughed up so many chances between them. It's a joke at this stage

1739~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> To be fair to him, he does bring long balls down on his chest really well, better then most other footballers.... Just that shouldn't exactly be enough to play at United

1740~~~
Fully expect FM to have chesting as an attribute in the future. Fellaini's chesting would be 20.

1741~~~
The amount of silly fouls he gives away is incredible. He just comes across really stupid on the field. 

I dont know or understand how he terrorized us with Everton. He must have been jumping for headers with Rio and avoided Vidic at every turn. Because Vidic is probably the best header of the ball ive seen in the prem in the last decade or so, and he would win every header against Marouane.

1742~~~
Was just thinking that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1743~~~
Everton played to his strength (that 20 chest control) and aimed balls at his chest for him to hold up. We aim balls at his head.

1744~~~
He's one of the worst central midfield players I've seen play for us, who've started regularly.

Just absolutely awful.

1745~~~
Stoke away too, could have had us back in the game.

Don't think I've ever hated a United player so much. Feels like he's poisoned the club since he arrived.

1746~~~
Maybe he and LVG can take the cab to the airport together.  Can't let Fellaini drive since he'd drive straight into the airport.

1747~~~
I just can't fathom why he is such a poor finisher. Was he always this bad at it? I always presumed no matter how poor his general play could be.. he was a bona fide threat in front of goal.

He still attracts goal mouth action but he needs to be much more efficient in front of goal to warrant a place at this club. His only saving grace is that he can influence the results of football matches during key moments. . If he loses this ability,  he becomes a useless player for us.

1748~~~
It's starting to seem like this guy isn't very popular here.

1749~~~
Not sure who's more to blame for this mess. Moyes who apparently thought it would be wise to bring him in, or Van Gaal who was too stupid to offload him, probably just because we played well in a couple of matches he featured in last year.

It's just sad now, he's already into his third season here and he hasn't even scored 10 goals for us in total. He works quite hard and has all the ingredients to be a cult-hero, if it weren't for the fact that most aspects of his game are just very poor and he sucks at playing football.

In the meanwhile Van Gaal decided proven goalscorers like Chicharito or even RvP weren't needed anymore and now we're 6th in the league. You can't make this shit up.

1750~~~
Let's see how the Fellaini apologist <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> tries explaining this one.

1751~~~
Those are some damning stats. He's just poor unless he's used in a very specific way. Playing in central midfield he can't even run with the ball. There was a point, in the second half I think, where Rooney played a lovely dinked ball to him and all he did was casually stroll with the ball, then fell over in an attempt to win a free-kick. Horrible.

1752~~~
Rafael would beat Fellaini 99 times in the air!

1753~~~
But shouldn't you expect that from the tallest players on the pitch? When he does it, its not chesting but his chest being there at the right place at the right time. Chesting is a way of CONTROLLING a ball. Is it controlling when you are not in control of the second touch?

1754~~~
This thread is basically what I expected.

Frustrating game for him. I thought he was quite good defensively. He made a few clearances and helped Blind out on occasion. A few niggly fouls that could have been avoided but you get them with him. His confidence is gone in front of goal. Ever since the game against Everton last season when he blasted one over he just doesn't seem to be able to score. Before that though he was quite good so it could just be a confidence issue.

I haven't done my ratings yet but i'm expecting him to have the lowest, despite it not being deserved. Did Schneiderlin even play? For all Fellaini's faults he is no coward. Constantly tries to be involved with the game and look for the ball.

EDIT: He has a lower rating than Smalling! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Come on. He wasn't good but that is just insane.

1755~~~
I remember that moment. I was annoyed because it was a good pass and he was in a great position but he was so lethargic and slow to the ball.

1756~~~
That is not true. If you have time watch the full match again and concentrate on his off the ball position and runs, it was cowardly. Blind had to run ahead of him many times while he just drifting. It's easy to look impressive by aimless drifting, like you are look for the ball. Drifting in offence is looking for advantageous openings and defensive drifting is looking to stifle opposition attacks.

I'm not surprised he has a lower rating. He made countless errors. Just because his errors are higher up the pitch doesn't mean he didn't make more errors. If Smalling played with a Fellaini-esque performance we would have conceeded more goals.

1757~~~
The day is he is sold I'll celebrate it like a title win. Can't come soon enough.

1758~~~
Not United quality by any stretch of the imagination. the sooner he's replaced the better off we'll be. He's such a limited, clumsy player.

1759~~~
Sell this oaf please!

1760~~~
I don't really want to join in the bashing but one thing i do wonder after having watched this guy for nearly 3 years now is.

What is his actual position?

For me he isn't a DM, his positional discipline or passing isn't good enough to be a proper CM. And he isn't good enough in general to be a no10, certainly not for a team with any ambition. And he sure as shit is no striker.

He needs to have a team built around him like he had at Everton to really shine i think. I just don't wish to ever watch a United team long term that's built around a player of his type.

1761~~~
Behind the striker.

1762~~~
His best performances at United have for me come in the advanced box-to-box role we saw last season. He is similar to Herrera in that he is not quite a proper #10, but nor is he a holding midfielder (though obviously their skillsets differ).

I certainly dont think he fits into the 4-2-3-1 very well, and would say the same for several other players.

1763~~~
This particular part is just so, so frustrating - because we aren't really playing these players in a way that would bring out their best qualities. Juan Mata would do be better as a right inside forward of sorts with Ander providing the mobility behind him as a right sided box to box, Martial can slot in as a Neymar-esque (positionaly) left wide forward with freedom to drift inside instead of being shunted a bit too wide. We could lessen the physical burden on Schweinsteiger, and even Carrick (in limited playing time) by providing 2 runners alongside/ ahead of them. The switch to a 4-2-3-1 was just so bizzare, especially when our best performances under Van Gaal have mostly been in the 4-5-1/ 4-3-3. Started last season with an obtuse 3-5-2, stumbled upon a decent formula, then went back to the drawing board to start from scratch. Just defies common reason - especially when we have to field several players out of their natural positions. In a way the mark of a truly great coach is building his tactics around the personnel at his disposal, not stifling the group in his orthodox scheme - which is what we have repeatedly seen with Van Gaal at United - starting with the ill-fated 3-5-2 experiment.

1764~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> I agree! (For once)

1765~~~
Seen him play there plenty of times for United. But can't say i've seen him have many great performances in the spot. 

He might as i said shine there for a team like Everton when the team is built to service him. But that won't happen at United.

1766~~~
Yeah our players, well a lot of them anyway seem to fit better into the 4-1-4-1 system we played at the end of last season. In that system on the left with Blind and Young he did play very well.

But 4-2-3-1 isn't that different really. We had Schneiderlin on today playing behind Fellaini and Herrera, so the role he's being asked to play while not the same isn't a completely different role and yet to me anyway he just doesn't look comfortable playing as a proper CM.

1767~~~
We can complain but he is being used as a squad player and 4th pick in a group of central midfield players.  Yesterday we did not have Carrick or BFS so he had to play.

Would be realistically find a 4th choice CM happy with that role as him?  If so, please name him.

1768~~~
I would gladly have played a 433 with one DM in Schneiderlin and played Pereira in Fellaini's place and I don't think the boy would have been worse.

1769~~~
I remember that and also remember me thinking that in the first 10 mins of the second half, he has misplaced a 5 yard pass out for a throw in, committed niggly fouls unnecessarily, and then when Rooney did put him through in a very good position all he does is dally on the ball while Martial or Lingard made a very good run in front of him and then he gets dispossessed.

Absolutely loathe seeing him start for us. What is Vangle even thinking?!

1770~~~
One can play football, the other can't.

1771~~~
Have we won a game with him in midfield this season?

1772~~~
I'll be honest, I don't exactly like the guy. Stupid player who often commits stupid fouls, and constantly arguing with the referees. That miss and the way he had that stupid grin on his face afterwards was just infuriating. What, because we were leading, you were allowed to miss a chance like that, hence the stupid grin?

1773~~~
Had a good spell last season, but i really don't get what he adds to our team right now. 5 fouls in the first 20 mns, all pretty much pointless, and missed a sitter at the end. Hope we get rid soon, or at least bring someone in to keep him out of our starting eleven.

1774~~~
50 shades of shit, every game, every position.

Any Sunday league player could do what he does. Fouls, passes backwards, loses possession.

1775~~~
He's our Bogarde. No one will take him off our hands with that salary

1776~~~
At least Chelsea had the good sense to keep Bogarde in the stands. They didn't keep playing him despite all evidence pointing to him being a bit shit.

1777~~~
we should plant a tree in the middle of the pitch every time we play. it'd be more useful than having fellaini out playing.

1778~~~
He's never belonged here.

Astonished at how much game time he gets.

His clearance for the Wijnaldum goal was terrible.

1779~~~
The "defending" for their first and the miss at the end at 3-2. Just unacceptable. If he can't put away an easy 6 yard header then what is he actually good for? What Van Gaal sees in him as a midfielder is absolutely beyond me, and most of us in the thread by the looks of things

1780~~~
I have been away for the last month and haven't been keeping upto date with all the injury news, but was LVG forced to play him in CM yesterday as Carrick and BFS are injured?

1781~~~
BFS picked up a knock on Saturday, not sure about Carrick. 
That says, LVG just plays him. Constantly.
He's down there with Djemba Djemba in terms of complete lack on ability. How he gets so much game time, let alone any game time, is baffling.

1782~~~
I still say his miss didnt annoy me as much as other things (but given thats meant to be his strength, it begs the question, what else can he do). Whilst he got into the position (and yes he should be scoring - but at that point were still 3-2 up with 10 minutes to go), its the other stuff like, killing momentum of attacks with fouls, he just cant keep the ball, he lumbers too much for the position hes meant to be playing and doesnt show for the ball as much as he should.

1783~~~
Agreed with that. What i dislike most is he seems to have zero ability with the ball. He is sloppy and fouls alot. I just hope he fecks off on the first occasion.

1784~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3397162/Marouane-Fellaini-Manchester-United-s-unlucky-mascot-unbeaten-without-relegation-form-plays.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tml?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490</a>

Title winning form without him. Relegation form with him. Surprised?

1785~~~
He is just a pretty poor footballer isn't he. I think i can pass a football better than him without falling over myself.

1786~~~
He's utterly useless. Can't honestly see how LvG think he actually offers anything at all in the starting 11. He's not even particularly good in the air and seems to lose headers against players a foot smaller than him. 

If only football was played solely with ones chest, he'd be remarkable.

1787~~~
As much as stats can be misleading at times, thats damning really. All those lost points won't have been his fault alone but he's certainly contributed.

1788~~~
It's not a question of selling him nor not, it's a question of whether we can get in a good replacement for him first. Until then, we don't really have an option.

1789~~~
He'll be sold this summer.

At the end of the day, he's got very little that a Manchester United player should have. He's big, strong and can have games where he dominates aerially. Although, even the latter hasn't been happening this season. His all round game is passable, at best, and his record defensively, <i>and </i>in the final third, leaves a lot to be desired. He's the sort of player who can make a <i>big </i>splash at a club with lesser expectations (i.e Everton), or a moderate splash at a big club, <i>when everything goes his way (</i>Manchester United). That's what has happened in his United career. A short burst of performances occurred, which naturally didn't last very long, where he damaged teams through his "unique" qualities, but over the course of a season and a half, it's been mostly the case of a misfit.

1790~~~
Are we <i>that </i>pushed for places in midfield though? We've got Schneiderlin, who's a regular, and Carrick and Schweinsteiger who can't play every game but still feature regularly. Blind can slot into midfield. Herrera can play there, even though LVG is terrified by playing a positive-minded midfielder in a deeper role.

1791~~~
We really don't need a player whose first intention, always, is to swiftly pass the ball to a team-mate. It's either cowardice or a recognition by him of his limited talent; neither is good enough.

1792~~~
You're being generous Steve.

1793~~~
That was close to the worst performance I've ever seen from a Man Utd player.

1794~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1795~~~
It kind of reminds me of myself when I was playing with mates against another group of mates who were our self-proclaimed rivals. I had...eh, dodgy ability football wise, so my first thought was always to see who I could move the ball to right away. Fellaini's kind of similar, now you mention it.

1796~~~
Big doesn't always mean strong. The amount of times a player of his size gets shrugged off the ball is outstanding. Strong is Aguero and Dembele.

1797~~~
We need a defender then to push Blind forward. That's where he played in the beginning and was his "intended" position, I think. And Herrera is just barely getting into the side as it is ...

1798~~~
He recognises his own limitations. Personally I dont see that as a bad thing at all.

1799~~~
He's not showing it enough but he's definitely got it in him to absolutely batter defenders and win most challenges. Did it for Everton a lot, in general and against us, and for us during his purple patch last season. But yeah, like I said, even the stuff that he's supposed to be good at has been lacking for most of his United career.

1800~~~
No, the bad things <i>are </i>the limitations.

1801~~~
I get that you're trying to defend him, and I admire that you're going against the grain and sticking to your guns, but surely, "He knows he's a bit rubbish as a midfielder.", isn't much of a defence? I mean, this is sort of supposed to be the position he's good at. I'd understand if he was somehow playing vastly out of position, but he's not <i>really</i>. Yeah, he's not in the exact position he was during his good form last season, but he's playing in a vaguely similar role and it's a worry to see a midfielder who just looks so uncomfortable with a ball at their feet.

1802~~~
Those referring to the stat that illustrate how we've lost more with him in the team than without should remember he wasn't even a starter till the Wolfsburg game. Had it not been for the insane amount of injuries we've suffered since October, he wouldn't be starting and we'd still be as shit.

1803~~~
No doubt. I concur with your comment. Just seems weird that he doesn't show it when it should be regular enough.

1804~~~
Well that isnt <i>quite</i> what I said. His supposed lack of technique and ability on the ball has always been ridiculously exaggerated on here. He has - over his time here - demonstrated that he isnt afraid to run with the ball, can make good forward passes and through balls and some great flick-ons. But instead of being a 'hollywood ball' kind of player who insists on trying 60 yard passes when they arent on, he is happy to just keep it simple and retain possession if there is nothing on.

I do think at the moment his confidence is pretty low and it is impacting his game, because last season he proved that he is perfectly competent on the ball, people just have short memories and have been desperately waiting for his form to drop so they could get the daggers out again. He is missing chances that I would have backed him to put away last season, and is losing possession when one of his biggest strengths last year was his ability to retain the ball under pressure.

Regarding the difference in position - I agree it isnt as though he is playing left back, but there are definitely differences in playing a holding role in a 4-2-3-1, and a box to box role in a 4-3-3. The biggest difference arguably is the need for more positional discipline at present, which is not one of Fellaini's strengths (although that said, LVG seems happy for him to get up and down the pitch at will anyway).

Had to post it, just too funny.

1806~~~
He's played a box-to-box role in virtually every game he's played this season. I went through the heat maps here: 
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-vs-sheffield-united.413210/page-16#post-18629238">Manchester United vs Sheffield United</a>

He's playing a very similar role to last season, attributing his comparative shitness to playing a <i>marginally </i>different position is generous to the extreme.

1807~~~
Fellaini has a time and a place and neither of those should be with Man United! I don't doubt that he is effective at times and last season he came up trumps a few times. But, by even having him in our squad, it surrenders our position as would-be purveyors of fine football. I appreciate we're not playing good football at the minute but that doesn't mean we should have players to go along with the humdrum and often hard to watch style that we currently employ. It's a chicken and egg scenario. Which came first the sh!te player or the sh!te football?

I don't understand how Fellaini is so weak in the air. Considering he can be aggressive (although often that just transcends into him being dirty) and considering his height, why oh why is he so weak at winning aerial duels. Yes, he does win a few but he should be winning a lot more. I disagree that he has no technique or control and sometimes his technique and ball control is pretty good, but after an initial decent display of controlling the ball it seems to take an age for him to get it going again on the ground. That header last night should've been in the net. Yes it was a decent stop by Elliot but considering his supposed headering 'prowess' he should be burying that.

Also, when he just ran into the Newcastle defenders that were on the ground. WTF was that all about? He could have applied some pressure in that situation and really caused Newcastle problems as the box was packed. Instead he plundered into the player like the big lumbering sack of idiot he is and gives a cheap free kick away.

For me, he doesn't offer enough going forward, he doesn't add any pace to the team, he is absolute garbage at defending in any capacity especially tackling and he drags the level/style of our play down to that of a rough and tumble battling team. I'm all for a bit of substance over style on occasion but I don't really think he has that much substance. His aggression is channeled in the wrong way as he's too interested in hurting other players rather than using it to steamroller opponents in a footballing capacity. There;s been talk about his best position and how he is played out of position, well, he's not looked  convincing in any position he's been played whether number 10, CM, up top, in the channel, DMF....

This current trend with him playing DMF is an absolute travesty. He is so ill fitted to that position. It is hardly a surprise that the games in which we have conceded a couple recently have been when he's been in centre mid. Schweinsteiger has had some flack on here and to some extent I can see why, but when he's been in that CM position our defensive unit has been tight for the most part but as soon as Bogbrush gets in there everything goes to pot. It's like Billy Smart's circus.

All in all Fellaini needs to go. His time is up. He's the player that symbolises the shambles that our squad and style has become over the last three seasons. He would've never lasted in SAF's regime so why is he there now. Panic buy from 'Deer in the headlights Moyes' and used to varying degrees of success by the 'outdated & stubborn LVG'

I'm sure someone else could wear the number 31 shirt to much greater effect. Sell him, loan him out, whatever. Just get rid.

1808~~~
That close control.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1809~~~
Yeah, he's usually been brought on when we're losing to be a target man and "rescue a point." It's a manipulative stat.

Our problems are deeper than Fellaini (or in the past Rooney) we're shit with or without him, let's not make him a scapegoat despite how much of a donkey he is on the ball.

1810~~~
He's not the cause of our problems, but he does a marvellous job of summing them up.

1811~~~
He's like a guy trying to eat soup with a fork

1812~~~
He is not a United type of plauer. Fellaini is of the standard for a David Moyes Everton team, he wouldn't get near a Roberto Martinez Everton team.

1813~~~
We've lost and drawn games 100% down to him.  He's missed about 7 absolute sitters in crucial games this season. If those go in we likely are 6-10 points better off.

1814~~~
Bull fecking shit.

1815~~~
The scapegoat of choice of course, always need one around here. He'll move on in the Summer probably end rightly so for him as he still offers a lot in the right set up.

1816~~~
My main gripe is that he's utterly useless at doing the actual centre midfield things, like positioning, calmness, passing, making yourself free to get the ball. If he's not playing up the pitch, using his chest control, getting into the box then he's pointless to have on the pitch because he's very limited.

1817~~~
Jones should play the DM position over Fellaini. I'm serious.

He should be an impact sub or played agaist big sides or deployed like he was last year at Anfield.

That was really bad yesterday.

1818~~~
He may be right for a team fighting for a Europa League spot at best, not a team trying to get back to being counted among the Europeon elites. So yes it would be right for us to move him onto a team which would be around his level.

1819~~~
He awful in the middle of the park. In either box though he's pretty useful. Blame it on Louis, he knows this seeing as he had him there last season.
 Jones is a better a DM but I don't see him playing there again.

1820~~~
I agree with this, and I'd go as far to say DM is probably Jones best position. He's a headless chicken at CB.

1821~~~
He is a fecking liability, a waste of space, and a waste of a midfielder...

All he literally does is amble about, giving free kicks away for stupid things, trying to protest his innocence and missing sitters...

1822~~~
In a defensive 433 Jones should play DM, he doesn't even have a bad technique and with the right manager he could improve a lot, if people had seen Matuidi at the same age he was a real donkey.

1823~~~
He's just plain god-awful. It was obvious after 20 minutes of the Toon game that he was going to be a liability for us. Constantly getting caught in possession then committing fouls when he lost the ball, watching high balls bounce over his head then plough into the nearest player in a panic, giving the perfect assist for the Wijnaldum goal, THAT miss. 
It was honestly like watching the tall, clumsy kid from school trying a sport they'd never had a go at before. Utterly embarrassing.

1824~~~
This really pisses me off the most. Ambling at the half way line when the opposition is counter attacking and the remaining players are busting a gut to get back to cover.

1825~~~
And then he comes from behind and clatter the ball carrier.

1826~~~
The guy is a fouling machine. The first 30 mins against the barcodes were absolutely ridiculous.

1827~~~
His style of movement is like an implicit admission that he doesn't belong - every game he starts, he moves like he's just come off the bench: tentative, cautious, all too keen to pass responsibility onto someone else.

1828~~~
... that being shelf-stacking at B&Q. 

He has zero redeeming features. I'd have hated to see him coming down to my Sunday league team, let alone seeing him line out for Utd.

1829~~~
That is easily one of the funniest comedy moments of my time as a football fan. There was also a shot at which would have made Jonny Wilkinson proud, if I remember rightly. 

That's actually the only time I've ever seen a player slide tackle himself.

1830~~~
Can we put this myth to bed?

The only thing he has done in the opposition box all season is miss sitters.

1831~~~
My favourite Fellaini moment from last game is on 5:57:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbxQuQft2ag?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

How the feck did we manage to end up with a player like Fellaini in our squad is beyond me. He does cheer me up from time to time with moves like this though.

1832~~~
So I guess this mean Real won't be coming in for him?<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1833~~~
Been crap

1834~~~
A lasting impression that can never be shed. Had a good game that day but made a mockery of it all with that.

1835~~~
I was going to post that after the game. I can't understand what he was doing, it's so fecking awful. I've never hated watching a player so much than him.

1836~~~
Rumours that AC and Inter Milan are competing to sign him. Get him on a flight to Malpensa before they change their mind!

1837~~~
They must need some smoke detectors testing.

1838~~~
How much could we realistically expect for him? Aren't both Milan clubs broke? I reckon 10m would be fair, but I doubt whether we'd be content to take such a big hit on him.

I'd rather we just cut our losses and move on. As he nears 30, that's the most we're ever likely to get for him.

1839~~~
I wholeheartedly agree. I reckon anywhere in the 10-12m range, we should bite their hand off. No doubt he'll be better wherever he goes but he's had his unfulfilled chance at United now

1840~~~
Utd have not lost a single game this season when Fellaini has been absent from the starting XI.
They have lost 7 games when he's started.

1841~~~
If he plays today we will lose. It is that simple.

Van gaal won't be able to help himself though. He is such a hipster.

1842~~~
Wolfsburg, Norwich, Bournemouth, Stoke, Middlesborough. Those are the games when he's started and we've lost, what are the other two games?

He'll play today by the way.

1843~~~
It's a remarkable stat. He's a liability when we are out of possession.

1844~~~
To me this guy is not a footballer. At Everton he sometimes looked like he had some skills; now I understand that was just down to luck, he didn't even know what he was doing.

I understand a few people are attached to him because he's a different kind of player than you normally see. Everyone remember the corner situations when we played Everton and we had Vidic up against Fellaini. That was the ONLY time you would feel worried at a corner situation. To put it in context you could also add Vidic used to be the best player in the world in corner situations at that time. Never lost a duel.

We should try to find a buyer as soon as possible. There is no future in a team like Manchester United for this guy. We should try to squeeze a few goals out of him coming in as a sub in the 80th or so. He can play a bit aggressive for a couple of minutes there. Then let him off to Italy. He would be great there. In England he's up against totally different people.

1845~~~
Starts today.

feck sake. Have we ever had a regular starter this bad in our Premier League history?

1846~~~
Not sure why he gets so much negativity. He is what he is and not sure currently we can say he's not Utd quality cause currently that's exactly what he is.....

1847~~~
Start him up the pitch and he'll rattle the Liverpool defense and Mignolet especially.

Start him in a midfield 2 again and we'll get thrashed. 


Lets hope the manager has some sense in him.

1848~~~
He's starting to counter Liverpools pressing game <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1849~~~
Hope he isn't playing in same position today, he is really poor in that role and I can't see us winning the game if he starts deeper because he ruins balance of the team and is a big liability.

1850~~~
Completely agree with the sentiment above. He'll be an absolute liability playing deeper, as we've seen every time he's played there (especially under Moyes). If he plays deep, I can see him losing the ball every time he's pressed and him just chopping down Lallana and Firminio and getting a red eventually. Play him further up, and he'd actually be a useful outlet ball for the press, as he was in this fixture last year.

1851~~~
I know there's a first time for everything, but has he actually been sent off for us yet?

1852~~~
He's only ever had two red cards apparently.

edit: in the Prem that is

1853~~~
CL - Villareal or someone?

He got away with a elbowing zabaleta and that stamp on a Hull player that got a 3 game ban.

1854~~~
Please, for the love of humanity, let him not be in midfield

1855~~~
Last game of last season

1856~~~
Fellaini script for the day;

<ul>
<li>Caught in possession numerous times</li>
<li>Won't jump for winnable headers numerous times</li>
<li>Will 'win' a few headers, which will go in no/any direction - most likely to a Liverpool player or into 50/50 no mans land.</li>
<li>Will break up any semblance of attacking football that we MIGHT dare attempt after Tuesday's anarchic display.</li>
<li>Will be his standard cynical self once he realises he's far and away the worst player on the pitch (and probably in the stadium!)</li>
<li>Will spend half his time doing that stupid, exasperated hands-over-face move like he actually thought he was capable of doing whT he was attempting (tackling, running, passing, jumping, heading)</li>
<li>Will kick/run the ball out of play.</li>
<li>Will pass sideways/backwards a LOT.</li>
<li>Will get sent off, standard elbows up/ kicking out behaviour.</li>
<li>Will inexplicably last 90mins thanks to LVG's petulant defiance.</li>
<li>Will cost us points. </li>

Please don't be shit, please don't be shit, please don't be shit

You will be disappointed, i bet he will start right next to Schneiderlin  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1864~~~
You're a shit script writer, get back to making up statistics.

1865~~~
Haha, spot on. And even if he scores a hattrick: "That was alright but he's not good enough".

1866~~~
Haha good call!

1867~~~
At Everton at time he was completely unplayable. Your bias is obviously overlooking his skill set. He should be played up front alongside a skilful striker. He's not a top 3 team striker, but will be a great signing for his next club. Shame some have completely forgotten how he regularly bullied Vida & Rio. He's out of form, being played in a position that isn't suited to him & is the scapegoat by a lot of fans for our current league position.

1868~~~
Forgot will miss at least one sitter.

1869~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Easy up on that high horse there Kostur... At least I have an opinion!

1870~~~
Stop making things up.

1871~~~
He's literally standing still in the box while Liverpool attack.

1872~~~
He's losing headers against Lucas....

1873~~~
He has been better than Schneiderlin, Herrera, Rooney, Lingard and maybe Martial, out of our front six.

1874~~~
Already see the anti Fellaini brigade coming out for no reason. He's really been no worse than our other attacking players though that's not saying much.

1875~~~
He's been no worse than everybody else. The game plan is shit.

1876~~~
He's been our best CM for whatever it's worth. Herrera is awol and Schneiderlin has been diabolical. But lemme it's Fellaini's fault they've been crap?

1877~~~
He's like baby jesus and all

1878~~~
He has done fine

Actually doing quite an important job

1879~~~
You're making up statistics in order to make Fellaini look shit, you literally <b>need to</b> make things up to make a shit player look shit. You can't fall any lower.

1880~~~
He's been shite as expected but still not Schneiderlin shite.

1881~~~
Good half from him been our best midfielder.

1882~~~
He wasn't anything special. Not even overly good really. But still better than most.

1883~~~
JUMP FOR HEADERS!!!!

1884~~~
Star of the show so far, he's been good in the last 15 minutes of the first half, other than that meh.

1885~~~
Don't need to make up how well he's performed against United whilst at Everton. I suggest you go watch some footage. Or quit being a troll.

1886~~~
He will get sent off.

1887~~~
Everyone has been shite, so take these comments within that context, but he's the only one getting involved physically like this is the derby it is. I want to see more players putting a foot in like him and going head to head with Lucas. Poor on the ball as usual, but at least he's putting his foot in.

1888~~~
Fixed for you.

1889~~~
He's actually been not too bad. Still looks like a bit of a bombscare, but he's generally not fecked anything up for us and has made the odd okay pass.

1890~~~
TBF they are marking him with 3 guys in corners and that early free-kick..

1891~~~
Yeah, it's United Liverpool and people are complaining about a bit of physicality and passion. Remembering the old RVN vs Arsenal saga and similar, we lack any sort of steel or bite in the team other than Fellaini. I can just imagine if he wasn't playing and our guys were getting bullied by the likes of Lucas and Henderson... It would be embarrassing to a watch.

1892~~~
Looks like a hybrid of Zidane and Keane compared to Schneiderlin today.

1893~~~
Aggression doesn't have to mean committing senseless fouls in the name of passion. Iniesta shows more passion than any of our players but by using a brain

1894~~~
Agreed. He hasn't really shown <i>passion </i>as such. He just shoved over an opposition player with whom he had a scrap.

1895~~~
He did feck all wrong in that silly Lucas episode.

1896~~~
What I don't get is that he's being used for his height and physicality, yet he never wins the important aerial challenges. He's not doing the main thing he's on the pitch for, so what's the point?

1897~~~
Another poor performance but same goes for rest of team no need to single him out. 

When opponents really compete with him in the air he really struggles for someone of his size.

1898~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1899~~~
Oh look, integral in our goal.

1900~~~
I'm taking partial credit for that after my previous comment.

1901~~~
Unsuprisingly

1902~~~
Useful header that. Fair play to him.

1903~~~
No Fellaini means no Rooney goal today.

1904~~~
No Fellaini, no party.

1905~~~
Ain't no party like a Fellaini party.

1906~~~
"Afro, afro man
I want to be, an afro man!"

1907~~~
Thought that he doesn't win headers (especially against 4 players at once) and was supposed to get sent off? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1908~~~
MOTM today, much better than last time

1909~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94348, @iKeano" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94348/">@iKeano</a> must be gutted

1910~~~
DDG is man of the match and by a mile

1911~~~
His "attempt" of a tackle on Can in the 88th min was an absolute fecking disgrace

1912~~~
always forget about goalkeeper, fellaini was my infield player of the game though, poor game full of average performances and he made the goal

1913~~~
Legend.

1914~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>

1915~~~
Agreed, but Fellaini did offer much more than the rest of our midfield and attack today I think. He made a fair old defensive contribution and gets up and down the pitch very well (yet folk still claim that he is lazy). About average going forward, but heavily involved in the goal.
Was perhaps the only player willing to stand up to the Liverpool bully-boys Henderson and Lucas too.

1916~~~
I think it was a poor game and we deserved to lose. Fellaini was dog shit but so was half of the squad

1917~~~
His header against the bar for Rooney's goal is reminiscent of Vidic. Four defenders on him and rattle the bar with it.

1918~~~
Effective, but hideous to watch. 

He's the personification of the Results vs Entertainment debate.

1919~~~
Not in the least.... The lad was shite as usual.

1920~~~
Definitely a poor game. I would say a draw would have been a fair result.

1921~~~
Like few others getting slightly carried away there, de gea man of match by a country mile. Did well for the goal but at the end of the day it was a header off target that fell kindly and that doesn't make up for another poor performance. Lots of players were poor today though so int that context he did ok.

1922~~~
they had more chances than we did.

1923~~~
Awful on the ball but industrious and got stuck in, in midfield. Finally a productive header, it's been a while.

1924~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love the reluctance. Some people seriously must be gutted <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1925~~~
He was quite good today I thought.

1926~~~
Awwww

1927~~~
Not too bad today. The usual problems are still there: his positioning is a bit all over the place, and his discipline is absolutely dreadful, but he didn't do too much wrong compared to some previous games and made a key contribution to the goal as well. A definite improvement.

1928~~~
He was very good today, miles better than Schneiderlin and Herrera and played a huge part in our goal. 

Thought he was going to lose his head at the beginning, but kept things under control after the Lucas clash.

1929~~~
He had a very good game

Don't be reluctant to give the guy praise

Was very important throughout

1930~~~
Thing is, he was average in attack - OK, but surely you cannot deny that he contributed a lot more defensively than the other midfielder/forwards. For instance, what did Herrera or Schneiderlin do all game?

1931~~~
He's trying but it won't be enough if we'll want someday to return to football elite.

For his abilities it wasn't a tragic game and we have no choice but to take that for the time being.

1932~~~
Shit again.

Only difference is that everyone(and I mean everyone) else was shit too so he doesn't deserve any more criticism than anyone else.

But the trend continues with him in the team, another terrible midfield and team performance.

If we continue playing him then we might realise we are average team who has no tittle aspiration and that's it really.

1933~~~
Not as bad as he was vs Newcastle but with him in midfield we can't build attacks properly. Later on we played to his strength by hoofing it to him, at that time he was useful.

1934~~~
Honestly he was one of our better players. I really don't mind him as a squad player, but he shouldn't be starting every game. In fairness, we had no choice.

1935~~~
Klopp can bring in Caulker as a big man upfront to save the game,yet we cant do that with Fellaini without massive whining.

He's effective , much more than some of the fan favourites. I'm glad we dont have to play against him, and hope that he pushes on like last season.

1936~~~
Slated him all game for not jumping for headers. What a player lol.

1937~~~
He was today, but it's the first time he's been effective in a considerable while.

1938~~~
He had a very patchy game, did some things well and some others that were utterly infuriating. He's clearly not good enough, but credit where it's due. He made some important defensive headers and was key for the goal.

1939~~~
The bashing on here has always been ridiculously harsh. He does a lot more than most give him credit for here.

1940~~~
He's a crap technical player but did well today and in big away games he is a very useful player for us.

1941~~~
Not for a long while he hasn't. His header which contributed to the goal today is the sort of stuff he needs to be doing on a much more regular basis, for example.

1942~~~
De Gea made one save, if I remember correctly (feel free to correct me on this). And that, too, was a standard save.

1943~~~
Such a vile personality.

1944~~~
He made several vital saves. Two excellent ones and a few more important stops. He had an excellent game.

1945~~~
He tried to chest it.

1946~~~
I lost count of the times he stood in no man's land watching Liverpool's midfield runners go past him. He can't pass, can't defend, can't mark, can't tackle and can't hold his position. The only thing he's good at is being a lump in the opposition's box.

1947~~~
I wouldn't be reluctant to give him praise, I actually don't hate the guy like some people seem to. He had a good game, he seemed to be everywhere and really was an important presence.

1948~~~
Rooney was shite for half a season but has got 5 in 4 games. 

Players go through dry spells.With Fellaini its because he's shite. 

The criticism with him is over the top. None of midfield and strikeforce has been playing well recently. Even Herrera who I like too, but the abuse levels vary significantly.

1949~~~
Good header which led directly to Rooney's goal.  Others were much worse.

1950~~~
Presumably because that "dry spell" has been for the majority of his career here.

1951~~~
I wouldn't be reluctant to give him praise, I actually don't hate the guy like some people seem to. He had a good game, he seemed to be everywhere and really was an important presence.

1952~~~
You've met him before, have you?

1953~~~
The positive spin is that he has at least been consistently getting into good positions to score and create. Obviously he has missed a few chances that I would have expected him to put away, but that shouldn't merit the level of abuse he receives every single game from our own fans.

I think he has been short on confidence lately, as well as not fitting into the current system as well as last year. He is definitely capable of much better but at no point do I think he has been one of our worst 2-3 players, for example.

1954~~~
Overall, had a decent game. With Herrera being in shite form, this guy should be played further up

1955~~~
This season? He's been in and around the worst bunch. I'd be hard pressed to name any regular first team players who have been much worse. Darmian, maybe. Rooney too for a good while, but he's improved lately.

1956~~~
I doubt either of you would have the same view if it was a player you liked.

1957~~~
Schneiderlin and Darmian after bright starts have both been terrible lately. Rooney was atrocious for most of the season, so has Memphis been. Mata and Herrera never seem to actually do anything either

Even when Fellaini is having a bad game, you can normally rely on him to contribute defensively, put himself about and give us options. Other players tend to go into their shells and be anonymous, whereas Fellaini will keep running and asking for the ball. His attitude is spot on in my opinion and I quite like the combative side of him - especially in Derby games like today where we sorely lack any real bite or steel from our other players at times.

Based on the above, I don't think it is any surprise or coincidence that LVG has given Fellaini a good amount of playtime and rarely subs him - he can be relied on to continue to run, work and contribute even when things aren't going his way. And days like today he can still pop up with an important contribution.

1958~~~
His work ethic is only useful when it actually adds anything though - like today, with a goal contribution. He runs about a lot but as a result it often results in daft fouls which get him booked, or going completely awol positionally.

I don't want to sound too harsh on him though, because I did think he was alright today and one of our better outfield players.

1959~~~
I think this is a bit harsh and that it is rather holding Fellaini to a much higher standard than others because he is deemed "not good enough".

1960~~~
I'm not trying to hold him to a higher standard though; just that of what I think we need in a player. And I'm pointing out that while his work ethic is unquestionable, the manner in which he plays football leads to some very notable deficiencies in his game.

1961~~~
On the pitch, I meant.

1962~~~
Who cares?

1963~~~
Sure, but my point is that - in the managers eyes if not the fans - I don't think you ever really get less that a 5 or 6 out of 10 from Fellaini. That even if things aren't going his way and the team is playing badly, that he will continue to contribute, to make defensive tackles, headers and clearances, track runners and generally get up and down the pitch and give the opponent something to think about.

Conversely players like Herrera, Mata, Memphis and Schneiderlin can be completely invisible if they are having a bad game or even if it's just that the team overall is playing poorly. Essentially I think their minimum performance level is a lot lower than Fellainis and that that is important to LVG, and also why Fellaini does not tend to get subbed off often.

1964~~~
It;s nothing to do with players I like or don't like. I don't think football should be played which such barbaric attitude whether he plays for United or not. It seems very English to define aggression as getting stuck to let your opponent know you are around. This is wrong football. Football should be played from your brain to your legs not just heart to legs. For this reason I did not like Rooney when he had his supposedly "red mist" or "fire in the belly" moments. It is a poor excuse for a footballer not to control their aggression on the pitch. You would hardly see players more passionate than Maldini for Milan but he wasn't an animal, was he? I do a bit of coaching for young people and I will not be asking them to be physical on a player. What are we going to teach them next? How to use your elbows efficiently? This is why Rooney can not stand with the likes of Iniesta, Lahm and other top players. Fire in your belly is not the licence to be physical but to creative. 

So whether it is Fellaini or Joey Barton or Pepe or Costa or Cattermole it should not be celebrated. We pay to watch intelligent footballers not animals.

1965~~~
People always complain about something. He adds a rawness to us which I like, as we're too 'nice'. I'm glad he contained himself and he did well for the goal. It's been a season whereby it's just not gone in for him. I think he's a valuable squad member. I think he was brave today. Took a nasty head knock from Lucas in the first half and then later jumps in again to compete. Some people don't see that though. We cannot have a team full of people we 'like' and he had to compete to win his header and he was unlucky not to score the winner.

1966~~~
Cant see him staying beyond the summer.

1967~~~
Much better today given that he was allowed to get higher up the pitch and bring long balls down rather than trying to protect the back 4.

1968~~~
Thank you Moyes for your unmatched wisdom.

1969~~~
We scored when he finally decided to jump and realise he can win a header that way. TBH, I think thats what he should be used for, set pieces near the end to cause trouble, not starting as a DM...

1970~~~
Out of interest, are you English/British? The reason I ask is it seems to mostly be a British trait to see passion and physicality going hand in hand. Obviously there's a balance between stupidly and physicality, but I think Fellaini walked the right side of the line today. I read before the game that he's only been sent off twice in the PL, so I think he knows how to walk that line.

1971~~~
I personally enjoy slating him but in all honesty he gives the team something different. Might not look classy or spectacular but offers variation and that's something this team needs. 
The onus is down to rest to compliment what he offers well, little things like going for the second ball and not burdening him with creative passing responsibilities.

1972~~~
Or pretty much any other responsibilities at all

1973~~~
Anyone who doesn't want the players representing their club to act over-aggressively or be prone to thuggish behaviour.

1974~~~
Did he kill someone? What did he do that was so bad?

1975~~~
I didn't see the first 30 minutes of the match so I don't know how he was during that period, but after that he was one of our best players. Probably the best match I can remember him having in that deeper role.

His movement was a hell of a lot better today than it has been lately. He was actually moving into good positions to provide an option for others to pass to, and he also did a fair bit of good work defensively. There were still moments he did get caught out of position, but nowhere near as much as what normally happens when he plays that position.

1976~~~
Things like tackling is too late for him to master, one of the reason Moyes stopped using him in a deep role because he always left the team exposed thru late challenges or losing the ball cheaply. 
That said he needs people to be mobile around him to mitigate his lack of awareness to make cutting or telling passes, having movement will make sure play doesn't stop when he has the ball.
Don't get me wrong he is not my ideal player and can't wait for him do awkward stuff so I can heckle him but he tries his best. So the least that can be done if we are gonna stick with him is create the right conditions.

1977~~~
He was pretty good in the second half. And he doesn't actually gets sent off. Limited footballer with odd skills, but did fine today.

1978~~~
Not by birth no but I learnt some football from the continent and have had coaches that played around the world. I suffered the same fate when I moved to England as a kid. A crunching tackle was more celebrated than a quick succession of one touch passes. I have always been though that aggression is a mental state of mind rather than a physical interpretation. I had to learn to win the ball with minimal contact with the opposition player by reading the movement of the ball (speed and spin) ,anticipation of the player, spatial awareness (open spaces and occupied spaces). It seems a lot but these are the things that make footballers intelligent, by using their heads.

1979~~~
I thought he played really well today and helped to kill Liverpool's intense pressing on a fair few occasions, especially towards the end of the game. Also attracted 4 Liverpool players to him for the goal.

1980~~~
4 Liverpool-players all attacking Fellaini - and lost. People can complain about us being lucky, but you can't possible defend any worse than that

1981~~~
Thought he was great today, really wish he'd put in more performances like he does against the victims, he's a lot better than most United fans think.

1982~~~
So more like rolling subs? Bring him on when we have a set piece and take him off straight away? I'd like that!

1983~~~
He was better in central midfield today but still a liability at times. Deserves credit for the goal too.

1984~~~
Glad to see people recognizing his effort today... played well, you forget how valuable he can be defensively he can be especially towards the end of the game when balls are being pumped into the box.

I still think he could be a valuable squad player for us

1985~~~
It's amazing that he gets in a Man Utd team just because he can chest a ball.

It's like Delap making an entire PL career out of throw-ins.

1986~~~
I thought he played really well today, deserves a bit of credit.

1987~~~
Good lord. I hate this hipster nonsense about right football and wrong football. But then again, you think Fellaini wouldn't even get in most Championship teams so you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

1988~~~
He really is a prick, putting his head in on Lucas (after stepping on his foot), claiming a non-existent handball penalty, and just generally marauding round the place being a twat, <b>but </b>he was comfortably our best midfielder today and instrumental in the winning goal.

1989~~~
He was our best midfielder because there is a fight in him. That is a good thing no matter.

1990~~~
I never made to any professional level neither am I claiming to be omniscient, its just my opinion. If you think it's OK that football should be played like that, fine with you. That is also your opinion. I don't know what is hipster about if mate.

IIRC, I said most top championship sides and I stand by it. Just because a player plays for a PL team doesn't it now mean he is PL pedigree?  About not knowing what am talking about, shouldn't be your issue here.

1991~~~
He's had one outstanding match against us, one. That's the famous match from 12/13, first match of the season, we had a shitload of injuries and started with Valencia as a right back Carick as a centre half. We had a central midfield with Cleverly and Scholes.

1992~~~
The thuggishness was exactly what was required. Players likee Roy Keane did it too. Of course he was a much better player but there are surely lots here who worship Keane due to his committment in fights

1993~~~
So have most of his teammates during the tenure of his spell here. 

They still dont get as much abuse

1994~~~
You arent the first to say that.

It's like Valencia, he's sale is greatly predicted yet whether the manager changes or not, he tends to remain.

1995~~~
Yeah, that sums it up pretty well. Probably his best performance this season.

Eh, not sure I agree with that. Mata and Memphis can be invisible, sure. But Morgan and Herrera are both grafters -- they do as much, probably more, defensive work than Fellaini does. The latter is more noticeable only because of his tendency to get involved in silly scuffles. Strong performance today, though.

1996~~~
Really strange comment, can't have been paying much attention to the game.

1997~~~
Easily one of our least shit players today.

1998~~~
Yes, standard save by DDG's standards.<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1999~~~
Played as a defensive midfielder and had a good game. Can we now end the myth of "he's only a target man" ?

2000~~~
No reluctance at all, there is just no point getting carried away because he won a header, it doesn't make up for a poor game and a really poor seasons of far. I said he wasn't man of the match which clearly he wasn't, he gets a lot of unfair criticism at times but equally some of the praise he gets is laughable, clearly a case of some people on both sides being desperate to be right so one good or bad moment is seen as defining.

2001~~~
So much better. Actually used his size and strength.

2002~~~
Our best outfield player today. Did very well.

2003~~~
My memory might fool me here, but i seem to remember at the start of last season, he had a more advanced position and occupied this awkward space between the opposing fullback and CB and caused all sorts of problems. 

Hes just to slow and static to play as a CM and its just plain stupid to play him there.

2004~~~
Fellaini got stuck in against an opponent who had reason to be confident and needed to be intimidated.  His header off the crossbar was actually a season highlight for him as he's generally poor, strangely, on headers inside the box.  I'd like to see a bit more polish in his passing in the last third, however.  The man was a primordial beast with his knockdown balls at Everton, a quality a really haven't seen much of since his arrival at Old Trafford.

2005~~~
I thought he was terrible. Lost the ball countless times, gave away loads of fouls, no composure, fair play with the header but apart from that he isn't a positive influence especially attacking wise. Him and Morgan in midfield means we won't be able to pass through midfield.

2006~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics and after a terrible first half, he stepped up and had a really good second half IMO. He actually looked like a good midfielder on and off the ball.

Credit where its due, we would not have won the game without him.

2007~~~
One of our best players. A shame his header didn't go in as it was a pretty good one. Why are people having a go over his aggression? He didn't even do anything wrong. He got clattered by Lucas early and then in their next little meeting he just sort of ran into him. Lucas kept going on about an imaginary kick that never happened. At least he showed some fight. If Herrera had done it I guarantee people would be fawning over him.

2008~~~
I wish his passing was a bit more crispier but he did his job today. Luckily they didn't have someone running at him and forcing him to make tackles.

2009~~~
People don't like him because he cant dribble or shoot from 30 yards, but the fact is sometimes you need gritty players like him. He can certainly be better but without him we wouldn't have won today.

2010~~~
He was definitely our best player. Broke up their play so many times and was generally a rock in midfield. I was left frustrated by his lack of quality on the ball but thats the trade off if he could chest control those long balls for us.

2011~~~

2012~~~
You must of hated Roy Keane

2013~~~
Sometimes you need a player to be a bit "thuggish". Lucas and the new Stevie-Me were being proper twats yesterday, I loved that Fellaini stood up to them

2014~~~
De Gea had a better pass percentage in the first half than Fellaini. Speaks volumes.

2015~~~
Given that de Gea completed 9 out of 21 passes I'm pretty sure he didn't. Why are you so hell bent on making up shit statistics? You know that it makes you look incredibly stupid, right?

2016~~~
Poor ouel Fellers; he done fine yesterday yet he still gets slated.

2017~~~
All in all, he was rather poor. Especially his passing

2018~~~
I'm confused about why you are showing me this?

2019~~~
I've heard people talking about some blatant stamp from yesterday. I can't recall it. Liverpool fan at work seems convinced he'll get a retrospective ban. Who did he stamp?

2020~~~
I thought he was awful, and his positioning in midfield always leads to us getting overrun. I don't think Schneiderlin had a good game to any extent, but I think he was tactically disciplined and tried to cover the holes left by Fellaini who kept getting lost in no man's land. His passing is really poor as well and he often breaks up attacks. I didn't have a problem with the grit he brought to the game, I agree it was probably needed, but I just think he was the main reason we were so poor with dealing with Liverpool in the first half, and he didn't bring much when we had the ball.

2021~~~
You were also confused when you described the situation.

2022~~~
How so? The video shows Fellaini running into Lucas, which I said, and then Lucas kicking his leg out to tell Clattenburg he got kicked, which didn't happen.

2023~~~
I like how he pushed down Milner.

2024~~~
How about you read a report that doesn't drip from your own turd-filled gob?! Its not my job to spoon feed you links to articles to enlighten you. 
Sky sports, squaka... Do some research yourself. Fellaini had the third lowest passing percentage of the outfield  starting 10 behind Young & Smalling. At half time De Gea's pass rate was better, not at full time. Still signifies how shit he is given that much of Smalling and Young's were defensive clearances.

I'm done with discussing him with you at any rate. Anyone that thinks he's Utd quality really isn't worth debating with.

2025~~~
Echoes my feeling. We never have control of a game when he plays CM and the way he wonders off leaves his partner exposed. All his CM partners this season have had poor games and been completely run over. Play him higher up or don't play him at all.

2026~~~
It shows him running into Milner, not Lucas.

Not to mention how daft it was, no idea why Clattenburg didn't award Milner a freekick to begin with.

2027~~~
He was our weakest link again. He generally runs around like a headless chicken and a half decent team can have him going in circles off the ball, and it doesn't take much pressing to expose his poor technique on it. If we insist on playing him he should be man marking someone or further forward as a target man.

2028~~~
Some are overrating his performance yesterday i feel. Thought he was poor and frustrating in the first half, better in the second though to be fair. But left Schneiderlin isolated and overran again for much of the match it must be said.

For such a big guy it's infuriating how many headers he doesn't win though. If you are that tall and you jump 95% of other players shouldn't be able to get to the ball before you.

2029~~~
He was the least worst of a really bad bunch. Not really over rating.

2030~~~
The whole "abandons the midfield" (and similar) argument is just ridiculous. Its quite obvious (to me at least) that he is being asked to play in more of a box-to-box capacity rather than in a holding role, and get up and down the pitch - which is something Fellaini does well.

<b>Surely</b> if he was meant to be playing a holding role similar to a Schneiderlin or Carrick, and was running around like this, we would see LVG berating him, dropping him...not continuing to pick him etc.

2031~~~
But he doesn't have the dynamism to play box to box. Is that not the point.

2032~~~
Define what you mean by dynamism? That he isnt dynamic, doesnt move enough? Because if so then I entirely disagree. Fellaini pops up all over the pitch regularly, yesterday he was often defending in and around our penalty area, and also making runs into the opponents box regularly to try to get on the end of crosses (something clearly instructed by LVG). This goes back to what I was previously saying in this thread that even if he (or the team) is having a bad game (and this isnt me saying that was the case yesterday), he will still keep working, running, contributing and trying to make a (positive) contribution, which is what happened yesterday.

2033~~~
Christ, if he was our best player, then there's something wrong...

I thought he was, again, a pointless waste of space...lumbering around, not winning headers in midfield, and shitting out of challenges...

Yes, he won the header which led to the goal, but other than that, he's just a strain on the team...he can't pass effectively, he can't really bring anything to the team, other than being someone who hey can twat the ball up to every now and then...

He doesn't have a footballing brain...last few minutes of yesterdays match, he has a chance to head into the corner and take the sting out of the game, instead, he gives it away and they get a chance out of it...

2034~~~
Yeah saying he was the least worst is a bit of a stretch. Theres people saying he was our best player, very good and there might have even been 1 or 2 who said he was excellent can't remember exactly.

Yeah so that's overrating his contribution yesterday in my opinion.

Awful first half, decent second half and that's about it.

2035~~~
In regards to his dynamism, the problem with Fellaini (like in various aspects of his game) is that it's vastly inconsistent. Sometimes he'll bust a gut to get back and provide some much needed cover, but then sometimes he'll be robbed of possession and kind of slowly turn around and vaguely chase whoever dispossessed him as if he can't be arsed. He's certainly not got enough to be a proper, consistent box to box player.

2036~~~
He was so patchy yesterday. Sometime he'd send a great ball forward or stop an attack, and then a few seconds later he'd lose his man and Liverpool would counter very easily. 
He can't track midfield runners for shit, his passing game is hit and miss, and he was a liability at times. He's a decent player, but he shouldn't be playing in a midfield 2.

2037~~~
First thing I thought of when I read that ridiculous statement.

He'll have his haters, but Fellaini seems thick skinned and it doesnt seem to bother him. 

Lets hope he continues to improve.

2038~~~
You would kind of hope a professional footballer wouldn't really give a toss what people think about him.

2039~~~
None of our midfielders should be playing in a midfield as we dont really have a great box to box that can both attack and defend(a Keane of sorts)

A midfield 3 with Schneiderlin, Herrera and Fellaini(as the one furthest foward)

Or Schneiderlin, Bastian and Herrera (furthest foward) . Although Herrera has not been playing well in that position.

That would work for me.

I may be in the minority , but I still believe in all Four of them, and feel they can all do better.

2040~~~
Sadly, a lot of footballers do.

Cleverley seemed to be one. Went to his shell as the criticism grew. 

Its hard to ignore criticism. Especially when it comes from all sides.

2041~~~
Can't stop watching: <iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/bof5" width="560"></iframe>

2042~~~
Cleverley certainly had a very weak mentality; that was even evident against the bigger sides when he repeatedly pulled a Houdini. Fellaini - bar the booing against Valencia that time - has never really gotten a hard time from the crowd. It's more in the media and on here.

2043~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Bloody hell Fellaini

2044~~~
That video is ridiculous. I can make a compilation of any player like that.

2045~~~
Not sure what I said has to do with hating any player. That a player should be able to play football with his brain without exerting excessive force on another player is hating? Just because we are used to see that kind of football doesn't make it OK, which is my point. I would like to see players win the ball clean and fair without hurting other players, that is skill and technique.

2046~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I had to end that 30 seconds before the end as it was making me angry

2047~~~
With that many bloopers from one single match, doubt it.

2048~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's trash.

2049~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2050~~~
Ah, we are onto youtube videos now.

I would say it is impressive the lengths people go to, to try to discredit him. It must really kill some of you guys to see LVG sticking with him.

2051~~~
From one random match? Nah

That video only highlights the bad of course but it sums up the majority of Fellaini's United career in a nutshell. Sadly.

2052~~~
I don't hate Fellaini and i think he can be an effective player at times. But what other midfield options do we have right now though?

If Carrick and Bastian were both fit do you think Fellaini would still be in the team?

2053~~~
What's wrong in saying that? Fellaini has been integral for us in every game against the scouse ever since LVG took over. He is physically imposing and he gives us that added bite and extra ball-winning ability in both the air and on the ground, something which none of our midfielders are capable of. People seem to have forgotten how many times Liverpool turned us over when we couldn't cope with their intensity and aggressiveness in midfield. Even when we were under Fergie, they still gave us an absolute hiding on several occasions. They don't have any particularly creative or skilful midfielders, but their strengths lies in their workrate and high-intensity game. With Fellaini in the team we have someone who can combat it. Yesterday the whole team played shit and it was a cagey. However I don't think there were better performers in the team than Fellaini.

2054~~~
I dont think Fellaini is first choice in this system no, and nor should he be. That said, he is essentially keeping Mata and Memphis out of the starting XI at the moment (as Herrera could drop into the deeper position instead of Fellaini).

If LVG really thought Fellaini was doing even 25% as badly as some of you lot suggest, he wouldnt be playing, simple as.

2055~~~
Oh I'm pretty sure you are done with me because I keep calling you on your bullshit, just like with the 'games we've lost when he starts' shit. 

If you think that it's not worth debating Fellaini in the Fellaini thread then why won't you just feck off to some other thread then?

2056~~~
Or any other system to be fair.

What? How the feck is he keeping Depay out? That would be Martial.

We play with 3 in midfield and we really only have 3 midfielders fit. It's not rocket science mate. Mata for various reasons is woefully out of form and Van Gaal prefers Herrera at 10 so he is arguably keeping Mata out i'll give you that.

But having said that i don't envisage us lining with up with both Herrera and Mata in a midfield 3, while Van Gaal is in charge so who else is there who could play there?

But he is playing badly, it's not some sort of mass hallucination mate. Are people exaggerating how bad he has been yes some are and he had a decent second half yesterday, but in central midfield he's been awful for weeks.

2057~~~
This is it. The video that sums up what Fellaini gives us. Everything he does has to turn into a physical battle, usually with him giving away a foul.

I remember thinking during the Newcastle game that he might not care about retaining possession as it allows him to show his "qualities". Stupid, I know, but I wouldn't put it past him.

2058~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2059~~~
Well I haven't done it but I'm sure it's possible. Fellaini has had his bad games but even when he has his good games you hear people say "lost the ball so many times". Same with Rooney sometimes. People will just over exaggerate the negative.

2060~~~
And this is why I very rarely bother engaging in any sort of discussion in this thread. Because about 90% of Fellaini critics cant seem to bring themselves to type more than about a sentence without feeling the need to add some sort of exaggeration or insult to their post.

Come on now. If we wanted to play Memphis we could drop Herrera to a holding role. LVG has played Memphis centrally before, or even better would be to play our best front two of Rooney behind Martial, giving Memphis the left wing (players in their natural positions? Madness!).

Again, there <i>are</i> other options if LVG thought he was half has bad as those on here make out. Fellaini has been no worse than the rest of the team - and no, that isnt the most glowing endorsement, but it is sad that he is continually singled out, abused and insulted by 'fans' to a <b>far</b> greater degree than anyone else in the team.

2061~~~
There is no mass hallucination. Most in this thread, even those that criticize him all the time, are giving him credit for his performance yesterday against Liverpool. You still see people saying he was complete trash/useless and what not. Clearly they either have an agenda or just hate them man if they think he was the worst on the pitch after yesterday.

2062~~~
Integral for us in every win against the scousers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

That's a good one...

He was pretty mint when we won at the end of last season. Apart from that, nah.

2063~~~
I'm not entirely sure why he'd get some sort of credit for his performance against Liverpool. He wasn't the worst player on the pitch for us, is that why he's supposed to get credit ? 

He wasn't good and he wasn't shite, he makes a boatload of bizarre decisions, like not going up for headers in midfield against Lucas because Fellaini prefers to chest the ball down, so he lost a few of those. His passing generally puts teammates under pressure, likes to pass it the same way as an opponent is running, so the teammate that gets the ball has to get rid of it quickly as an opponent is coming charging in straight at them. His positioning is Anderson-like, just leaves massive gaps and is caught running between opponents passing the ball. 

He does well towards the end, when they pump the ball towards our defence, and he did well for the header which ended up with Rooney scoring. Apart from that, overall it's not exactly a good performance.

2064~~~
He was still crap v Liverpool, just not as crap as he has been. His Newcastle performance was so bad and probably the worst I have seen from a united midfielder. He does give us some fight and steel but still he should never start for us when we have other options fit.

2065~~~
He was truly awful against Liverpool albeit he technically got the assist I assume.

2066~~~
They do i agree and have said as much a few posts above.

But Fellaini is too clumsy for me to play in Central midfield. You could even go through his good matches and make a video with stuff like that. And there in lies the problem really.

2067~~~
But i don't happen to be one of those people i have already said i thought he was decent in the second half.

I was referring to this notion that the majority are being unfairly critical of him. Which is just not true we are all watching him and we (well most of us) can see he is not playing very well in CM.

2068~~~
I can't contain my bias anymore:

The best part of his game is his movement in the box, he gets into some great attacking positions. Apart from that he's possibly the worst premier league footballer i've ever watched. 

He's reckless, he's slow, he's lazy. He can't mark, he can't dribble, he can't tackle, he can't shoot, he can't pass more than 20 yards, he can't control his elbows. His hair doesn't even look good. Worst of all, despite his height and strength, he's heading ability is average at best, which - incidentally - is probably hindered by his absurd hairstyle.   

I'd honestly prefer Djemba-djemba, at least he ran properly.

I don't care what contribution he has had for us this season or last, I don't care how many points he has salvaged for us, he is the antithesis of everything I hold dear about this beautiful game.

2069~~~
Well I don't know about you but I do think the majority <i>are </i>being unfairly critical of him. Most on here are not criticizing his game for the most part but are making statements as to just how bad of a player he is. An example is the poster above me who says he's possibly the worst premier league footballer he's ever watched. Tell me that is not unfair criticism.

2070~~~
A pity this beautiful game has such a one dimensional and distorted shape to your eyes.

2071~~~
This

and this

..and this

aaaand this.

Okay, yesterday he won that header which lead to Rooney's goal, so credit where due. But overall his heading win ratio and accuracy thereafter is absolute hump. Other than that he's an ambling neanderthal. Useful when we need someone hitting with a metaphorical club, but offers nothing towards any footballing intellect. Please sell him on, please, please....please

2072~~~
I hate player bashing myself, i like to think i am never too harsh on a player beyond pointing out if they are playing bad or deficiencies in their game. I never make it personal or go on nonsensical rants. And i have been on the other side defending players like yourself, including believe it or not Fellaini at times last year.

Listen mate i would classify myself as nothing more than a mild Fellaini critic. I don't hate him and i have no idea where you think i have exaggerated or insulted him?

He isn't first choice in any system or position really, you might disagree and thats fine. But if we are using Van Gaals team selections as evidence then when everyones been fit this season he hasn't picked Fellaini. 

You're stretching.

We play 433 with 3 CM's, the third player being Herrera, Rooney or Mata sometimes. Depay is a winger and has played no more than 2-3 games at no10 in his career, Fellaini is currently playing in midfield. He is not keeping Depay out of the team in any way and even if he was with with how badly Depay is playing it's not exactly something to be crowing about. Or held up as an example of how well Fellaini is playing.

Out of Fellaini, Mata and Depay Fello is the only one who can play in CM thats why he is currently in the team. And out of Fellaini and Herrera he is more physical which is why he is preferred in CM to Ander.  The minute Carrick or Bastian are fit he will be out again. Harsh but true.

2073~~~
A lot of that is shit play by him but there's also a number of fouls there which really weren't, plus the bit where he was waiting for the ball, so were two others.

2074~~~
Hes clumsy. He has a worse first touch than Rooney after a pub night. He isn't even exceptionally good in the air for his height. Complete waste of space for us.

2075~~~
What??

I enjoy watching Messi effortlessly glide past players.
I enjoy watching the power Ronaldo.
I enjoy watching the silky passing of Ozil 
I enjoy watching Glenn Whelan whom understands his limits and keeps his passes safe and tidy.
I enjoy watching Phil Jones tackle people with every part of his body and soul.
I enjoy watching Cattermole kick the shit out of everything that comes near his 18 yard box.  
I enjoyed watching Christopher Samba utilize his strength
I enjoyed watching Titus Bramble scramble back to recover his mistakes again and again
I enjoyed watching Scott Parker tirelessly snuff out chances and close opposition.
I enjoyed watching Andy Carroll climb highest to win headers
I enjoyed watching the savage enthusiasm of DJ Campbell. 
I enjoyed watching defenses try to organize themselves as Delap prepares a throwing.
I enjoyed watching Tipton Town vs Dudley Town in the West Midlands Regional League on a cold December day on a pitch that was more mud than grass.

I love this game, but Fellaini offers nothing to admire. Despite what some people claim, he's far from an arial specialist and to me signifies what has been wrong with English football for the last 15 years - if he was 3 inches shorter, would he be playing in the premier league...most likely not.

2076~~~
Some are unfairly harsh on him no doubt. But thats whats happens when people get frustrated watching the same player perform poorly every week. I don't like it myself but it is what it is. I get very frustrated watching him if i'm honest.

As for being the worst PL footballer he is obviously not. He has attributes that make him a very good and effective player in the right set-up.

But that type of exaggeration stems from his actual skill on the ball i think. In terms of ball control and passing he is one of the worst i have seen at this level certainly at United. It always surprises me how he can train everyday with a football and yet have so little control over it and such a poor first touch.

2077~~~
Personally I would have him as first choice along with Herrera in front of one of Carrick/Schneiderlin in a proper 4-3-3 like we played last year, with Schweinsteiger able to cover any of the three midfield roles very well.

Perhaps I overreacted on that comment, but this thread tends to have that effect at times <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Nah, 4-3-3 is what we played last season, this is a 4-2-3-1 with two holding mids and a #10 (although recently with Fellaini he has operated more in a box to box role than as a pure holding player).
Personally I vastly preferred the 4-3-3 of last season, but that is a different debate.
Fellaini "keeping Memphis out of the team" is not quite what I meant, but rather that if LVG felt Fellaini's performances were not up to scratch then we do have other options - and this is because unlike you I believe that Herrera can play in the deeper role (although neither that nor #10 is his best position - it is the same as Fellaini's, operating as an advanced #8 with a dedicated holding player behind him).

2078~~~
Ive watched him terrorise us on many occasions. Play him in his best position and he's an handful. Does help if you can actually have people who can cross the ball though....

2079~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2080~~~
Fair enough mate no worries.

I preferred the formation we played towards the end of last year as well. But this is where we get into formation debate territory and after a while we all realize most of these formations are basically the same 433 but with subtle differences.

For the record Van Gaal describes this formation as 433 with the point in midfield facing forwards, hence the the two DM's. Last year it would have been 433 with the point facing backwards, only one DM. But then the way we were playing towards the end of last season was described by many as 4-1-4-1 and to be honest thats not wrong either.

I actually like Ander in there, i just don't think Van Gaal does probably takes too many risks for his liking. He continually left him out of CM last year in favour of other midfielders and even Rooney. I can't recall Herrera playing in CM too many times this year at all. I don't think he really likes Fellaini in there either so he is playing both along with Schneiderlin to give us numbers in midfield.

I reckon Van Gaal thinks this is the best combination currently available to him considering our injuries. I do know Fellaini hasn't played in a CM too much for Van Gaal either. 

For what it's worth i actually agree with you on where both are best deployed, but for now at least Van Gaal thinks differently.

2081~~~
He was better than schneiderlin. He made mistakes and was clumsy, but later on in the second half improved and held the ball a bit better and had a role to play in the goal. Whereas Scheniderlin was invisible throughout.

2082~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant (and terrifying)

2083~~~
I think it shows him running into both of them. Although obviously it is more aggressive with Milner.

And yes, I thought Clattenburg would pay a freekick too.

2084~~~
Can't stand the guy. 

As a midfielder, he's Championship standard and has no place playing for Manchester United. If only he hadn't got injured at the beginning of last season, Napoli would have taken him off our hands and we'd never have to see this lumbering oaf stinking the place up.

2085~~~
And we probably wouldn't have got 4th last season.

2086~~~
<i>'Marouane Fellaini, who commits 2.18 fouls per fixture - more than anyone else in the division'</i> - extract from the below BBC article about Diego Costa. This sums Fellaini up really. If he was making these fouls because he was a ball-winning tackler and misjudged a few, then fair enough. Instead he just runs around like the Pepperami animal man, fouling and rarely winning the ball. He's a calamity. I really wanted him to work at United but the joke has gone on too long now.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35061044" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35061044</a>

2087~~~
Seems another midfield job for him again.

2088~~~
He does make some daft fouls, but his count isn't helped by the fact that referees don't seem to understand the difference between fouling someone and being taller than them when he's involved. A lot of the stuff he gets called up for would never be given if he was 5' 10", and other players get away with fouling him, seemingly on the basis that they're smaller than him.

An incident that springs to mind is Jack Wilshere headbutting Fellaini. If he'd done that to someone nearer to his height he'd have been off no-question, but since his headbutt just went into Fellaini's chest apparently it didn't count and he didn't get carded iirc.

2089~~~
Liverpool fans used to say the same about Crouch. How the mighty has fallen

2090~~~
I dont like him as a player, but its true he put in some big performances last year, to get us into the top 4 in our toughest run of fixtures. I also noticed myself he gets fouled, and the other players have their hands all over him, but as soon as he reacts or does similiar he gets fouls called against him. Defintely not my type of player, but its is annoying how the refs give fouls against him all the time, just because hes the bigger player

2091~~~
I actually agreed with Liverpool fans at the time. With Crouch, it was mostly a valid point. With Fellani, well, he commits more daft fouls (that has nothing to do with height) that Crouch did. You'd think he'd stop elbowing people by now.

2092~~~
Think he starts today. 

Likely him, Herrera and Morgan in midfield.

2093~~~
Sadly, I think you're right. Will this be the day he sees a red card?

2094~~~
Unfortunately 100% he'll start today... The one header he jumped,for last week has cemented him in place for the next four weeks.... Philosophy that.

2095~~~
Thought he would have last week... But he will one of these days, it's as inevitable as him turning slowly in a circle watching midfield play bypass him, running the ball out of play & being dispossessed like a sleeping child. Every. Single. Game.

2096~~~
You seem to be positively gagging for him to get sent off.

2097~~~
Not really, but considering he's been lucky at least 2 times in recent memory, I am expecting the worst.

2098~~~
I don't mind him, if we played him like we did last season. Despite how obvious his limited ability is, he sure has a nack for popping up with key moments/goals.

2099~~~
My issue with him isn't necessarily with him being a target man, nuisance or whatever. It's just him being obviously not good enough in whatever role he plays. He's a poor deep lying midfielder, who is slow on the ball, immobile, loses possession, and can't pass. Put him further up and those attributes stop him being an effective number ten, so he essentially becomes a battering ram. He's not technically good enough for either position, but who else do we have right now?

In an ideal world, we'd have better players for both. The problem is they're all injured and Van Gaal's hand is forced. I don't blame him for keeping him around after last season, but i definitely think he'll be moved on this summer.

2100~~~
I really don't mind him, there's no such thing as man utd quality, never has been if you look at the teams in the past. There is something about man utd mentality which I think he has. I think he doesn't pretend to be something he's not, nothing flash, beard or tattoo's or any other clique and like that about him. I've seen him a few times around Manchester and at Trafford centre and he's really down to earth man that never refuses pictures or signitures.

For me, he's just another player in a long line of players that players love to kick. Last season played IMO played the most significant contribution (with DDG) in the second half of the season in us qualifying for champs league. More importantly playing in his right position.

2101~~~
Hahaha.... Come on, he has the novelty hair of sideshow Bob!

2102~~~
That's me point. He's his own man.....

2103~~~
With his selection again today, LVG is confirming that Fellaini is an integral part of this team. Good to see that.

2104~~~
Strongly disagree. Just can't see us winning anything with Fellaini in the team, domestically or in Europe. I hope I'm wrong 'cause it looks like LVG is sticking with him for better or worse!

2105~~~
LVG thinks he is and sticks with him for whatever reason. I want to believe that he sees an important player in Fellaini. Some may not like it, but it does not matter at least as long as LVG wants him in the first team.

2106~~~
I hope he does well today, but I really hope this is his last season here.

2107~~~
We have three fit midfielders at the moment so I wouldn't make to many assumptions from the fact he is starting, all our other midfielders has more starts than him this season.

2108~~~
He was not starting early this year, and others did. They didn't do necessarily better. LVG currently believes in him and we are not worse off in the past few weeks.

I'm not saying he is great. I'm just saying that LVG wants him as a starter at the moment, and he has his reasons.

2109~~~
The rest of us see feck all alternatives as both Carrick and Schweinsteiger are out with injuries.

2110~~~
Herrera can't play in midfield and Mata behind Rooney? Or God forbid, two strikers?

2111~~~
They probably can. Just like Park and Rafael could play central midfield against Blackburn. 

If they should play there is a different question

2112~~~
Useless lump. Just useless.

2113~~~
That clearance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2114~~~
That stamp looked intentional.

2115~~~
I suspect that every tackle he makes would look like an intentional foul to you.

2116~~~
I suppose he's the reason for cancer and aids as well.

2117~~~
In fairness, nobody cares about your suspisions

2118~~~
If that's what you suppose

2119~~~
My suspicions only pale in comparison to your illuminating thoughts on how Fellaini is in fact the very spawn of satan and likely responsible for all that is wrong with the world, I am sure.

2120~~~
Yeah. Players playing in their actual position is comparable to that.

2121~~~
Stop overdramatizing.

Stamp looked intentional by the way he puts his foot down in that situation.

You go on moaning about it being the same as portraiting him as the spawn of satan.

Mint.

2122~~~
Yeah, some people look at him here as if he is indeed the source of world's problems when he is not even the only problem Man United has.

2123~~~
I don't think that's Herreras actual position.

2124~~~
He's been the best CM so far...again for whatever it's worth. Schneiderlin and Herrera have been complete garbage.

2125~~~
Playing him as a midfield target man is a crime against humanity.

2126~~~
If I could really be bothered to go through your posts in this thread then they would paint a pretty obvious picture.

2127~~~
For some strange reason that's a sentence you seem to copy&paste for the majority of matches.

2128~~~
That i think Fellaini is shite ? I've said it numerous times, if you need to go through my posts to paint a similar picture it speaks volumes about you...

You are still overdramatizing

2129~~~
Only the last two games where he's better than both.

2130~~~
He's been our best player so far, which is more a slight on everyone else really.

2131~~~
Not really. Quality wise it's shit all over the place.

2132~~~
He at least manages to get himself involved in the game, unlike Schneiderlin who has been specialising in anonymity lately.

2133~~~
Yes really. He's been better but carry on signing him out.

2134~~~
All three in midfield have been rubbish. Fellaini giving away fouls and giving away the ball. Has won a couple of headers I guess, and a couple of tackles. Should have been booked for elbow.

2135~~~
He represents our non-football perfectly.

2136~~~
Literally you in this thread.

2137~~~
Then he mustn't have a position because playing behind a striker certainly isn't his position. He's been shite there.

2138~~~
The term "better" isn't a sign of quality.

3 piles that smells like shit, one smells slightly less like shit, smells better, still smells like shit.

2139~~~
If that's your theory, then that's your theory.

2140~~~
Yes. Being proven by what we see on the pitch too. Swap him and Fellaini and you'd get more from both.

2141~~~
Never said it was.

I don't particularly care for Fellaini but singling him out when there's loads worse than him is ridiculous.

2142~~~
He's awful. Him 'playing well' doesn't actually mean he's a good player, it's in relation to his actual ability. He hurts you in all round play in order to add a threat at set pieces. He's terrible on the ball, he slows down our already useless play by offering even less movement that the average premier league player. Him pressing the opposition is like when a young child tackles you and they go straight for the ball. He's a less player than the opposition in every facet of his game that's relevant to our play at the minute. Every time he takes an extra touch the opposition team has another lifetime to get back in position.

2143~~~
We never look to have a good control of centre midfield when he's playing. He puts himself about but he's rarely in sync with any of our other players on the pitch

2144~~~
He's not being singled out.

2145~~~
This. Exactly this.

2146~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So true. I can't fathom how Fellaini is a top flight footballer let alone a Utd player. A worrying benchmark of how low standards have fallen. 

That doesn't mean other Utd players aren't below par, but they aren't so visibly shit, cynical & adorning ridiculous clown-hair which highlight the shitness!

2147~~~
To be fair, with the way our team play this season under LVG I think its probably a good thing to not be on that wavelength!

2148~~~
We finall see eye to eye MDFC!

2149~~~
We'll see now.

2150~~~
The integral part of this team is now off at half time.

2151~~~
Biggest cheer of the game!

2152~~~
Except for last season where we did look in control with him in a 3 man midfield.

2153~~~
Needs to leave the club asap

2154~~~
I hate him more than van Gaal.

2155~~~
Already looking more in control of the ball, now that we don't have to lump it to his head at every opportunity

2156~~~
Comfortably better already. No great surprise either.

2157~~~
Not very suited for a 2 man midfield,
Schneiderlin looks better as well.

2158~~~
In fairness, your point was moving Fellaini further up, Fellaini took him off <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2159~~~
So nice of you.

I look forward to 5-0 now that he is out. Mata will score 4 of those.

2160~~~
Thank you Darmian. They are cutting our midfield at the moment. 

If we win, it won't because he is out, just like if we win with him in the team it's not thanks to him.

2161~~~
My initial point was we could play Mata behind the striker and Herrera in midfield. Also that Herrera is a central midfielder and not a forward.

2162~~~
I know

2163~~~
Unless he's played up top as a target man, he's useless.

2164~~~
This is a 100x more watchable, though.

2165~~~
Absolutely nothing to do with Fellaini. This is our MO. Play shite first half, start 2nd half slightly better.

2166~~~
We did nothing in the 2nd half and at the moment mostly defending.

I think we can grind a win, just like last week with Fellaini, but is this really better football? C'mon!

2167~~~
If only we had someone on who was strong on defending our box in the air.

At least our football has still be shit and boring though.

2168~~~
45 mins later in and ?

2169~~~
Like all the sterling defending work he's done defending corners this season? Oh wait...

2170~~~
Yes, in fact.

2171~~~
Oh my...what a magnificent performance it has been without Fellaini. Truly a joy to behold!

2172~~~
Thank feck he's gone off at half time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He probably was hampering all the players from bench as well. We've played some slick football 2nd half indeed.

2173~~~
Slightly better to begin with. Usual shit thereafter. So ultimately we were shite both ways. Are you happy?

2174~~~
The Fellaini stink strikes back. Relegation form with him!

2175~~~
3 games in 3 seasons. Wonderful

2176~~~
A lot better than 3 games but carry on

2177~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Your agenda is so blatant.

2178~~~
We looked a lot better without him for about 7 minutes in the 2nd half, then we went back to looking hopeless, but also losing every 2nd ball, the kind that Fellaini normally wins.

He is a paradox. We're both better and worse without him.

2179~~~
Couldn't have put it better myself.

2180~~~
Maybe you wanna check all my pre-match comments every time he starts. My record is tidy, its not an agenda mate!

2181~~~
When Akash accuses someone of having an agenda re Fellaini!

2182~~~
I think he's shit as well. I don't understand why he's the scapegoat when he's not even the worst CM.

2183~~~
Taking Fellaini out today created lack of balance in our team. Herrera, Mata, Lingard and WJackson are not defensive players, which in the absence of Carrick and Bastian created a hole in our midfield. Half an hour before their goal, I said that they are "cutting our midfield" and that continued to happen. Schneiderlin alone couldn't do the defensive job. I wouldn't take Fellaini off today unless I could introduce Carrick or Bastian, both unavailable. Furthermore, when Fellaini is available in tight matches he can help in two more ways: defending set pieces and being a target up top when we need a goal. We had none of those in the 2nd half today, and we had all last week at Anfield!

2184~~~
He's a fecking shite player who has no business being at a club like United. That's all there is to it. Will almost definitely be sold once LvG gets sacked and I can't wait for the day both him and lvg are gone

2185~~~
Here I was thinking that today's result was down to LVG or the players collectively, but of course thanks to redcafe I have seen the light that it was actually Fellainis fault!

2186~~~
He should be driving around the pitch in a tiny mini wearing a clown suit.

2187~~~
Fans cheering his substitution was appalling. Whether he's good enough or not, he always gives it a good go on the pitch.

2188~~~
Aye, Van Gaal's incompetence is being completely ignored...

2189~~~
He was awful and rightly taken off, hopefully be last we see of him for a while now.

2190~~~
No he doesn't. He's simply lazy. Just strolls around when United don't have the ball.

2191~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2192~~~
I don't actually think he's lazy. I think he's just completely clueless as to where to position himself. So he just runs slowly, hoping he's not doing anything wrong. Plus he's a really bad ball-watcher and a really slow-thinker, so he's genuinely just two seconds behind play half the time.

2193~~~
You could well be spot on buddy.

2194~~~
Contributed more in his United career than Herrera though. Should he feck off too?

I knew that people would rave about those six minutes after half-time where we looked better and he was off the pitch. The reality is though that the same thing would have happened had he been on the pitch. There was always going to be a response. Just one of many who is being played out of position and struggling. He wasn't that bad, won the ball back a few times, but wasn't good either.

2195~~~
shit dipped in shit

2196~~~
Fellaini supporters can do one, honestly. There's a long standing tradition of a select few of his bandwagoners frequently taking pot shots at other players in this very thread just to make a case for him. Discuss his merits, and pipe down. No need to blab about Ander in his thread or here just to prove a point about Marouane the donkey. Do people incessantly bring up Fellaini in Mata/ Darmian/ Rooney/ Memphis's threads? No they don't, and for good reason. You don't need to put down one player in another one's thread to fortify your argument. Do it on the basis of that individual player's record/ accomplishments/ perceived talent level.

/rant. And nah, you don't need to dig up posts from the other threads. The primary issue is with the frequency.

2197~~~
You probably are right but it is not like the balance of discussion is fair on either side.

2198~~~
I think I keep saying this, but he should never start at DM or in a 2 man midfield again.
In fact he really shouldnt start for us at all and should be a plan C or D (like when we were losing 1-0 today and should have come on last 5 minutes)

But saying that, the guy need to JUMP. JUMP MAN!!! He just tries to lean and never jumps. And when he does jump it seemingly goes over his head or he ducks under it. Hes a big man who can only use his chest it seems.

2199~~~
? What exactly has fellaini done? Herrera has more United goals then Fellaini does in 23 fewer games played

When we hit our stretch of form toward the end of last season Fellaini was our best player. Maybe 2nd best with De Gea but whatever, he contributed more than Herrera. Not saying Herrera was bad, he just wasn't as pivotal. So in my opinion Fellaini has had a period of football that is superior to anything Herrera has produced with us. So he arguably has more business being here than Herrera.

This will be a pointless discussion though because we clearly have very different views on both players.

2201~~~
Disagree personally. Thought Herrera played a much bigger part in our overall game, and while Fellaini did well in helping us get the ball farther up the pitch by bringing down the long balls, it was always more of a means to an end, while Herrera just genuinely played really well and was exactly the type of player we cried out for for years. 
Agree to disagree though.

2202~~~
That was like 3 games. Big effin deal.

2203~~~
He should play as an attacking midfielder but a single DM set up doesn't work with Schneiderlin like it did with Carrick. So he should be on the bench and playing as an impact sub. Fellaini playing deeper is tactically one of the biggest reasons for our poor form, luckily Van Gaal seems to have woken up to the fact by withdrawing him at half time.

2204~~~
You know I am more than happy to have a long and sensible discussion with you on here Invictus, but I find that is impossible with Fellaini because by and large, his critics (yourself included frankly) simply exaggerate his flaws, dismiss his merits and find any excuse possible to scapegoat him. I am only bothering to reply to you here because I know you to be a very good poster who is actually worth discussing something with normally. Frankly it saddens me to see posts from you like the one I quoted, silly as that may sound.

The fact that (when last I checked) Fellaini had the lowest rating from today's game is a case in point. Januzaj came on and did nothing except concede a soft free kick which led to their goal (that cost us the game). Lingard had <i>another</i> game where he contributed nothing, Schneiderlin likewise. Did Fellaini actually perform worse than those players? Were we a worse team when he was on the pitch in the first half? The goal conceded and general performance suggests otherwise. This isnt a case of bringing up other players to justify Fellaini's performance - which was nothing special today by any means - but rather to draw attention to the fact (and it is a fact) that Fellaini gets an incredibly harsh deal from most United fans - being cheered off the pitch by the "fans" is another suitable example. It is to highlight the extreme and disproportionate amount of criticism and plain abuse that he gets on here, despite usually being (at the very least) no worse than 2-3 other players in any given game.

Fans are upset because we lost the game - myself included. Was it Fellaini's fault? Of course not. The statistics bandied around last week about our winning % with/without Fellaini were deemed by some as irrefutable evidence that he shouldnt be playing. Well today, we played 45 minutes with him where we were quite bad and it finished 0-0, we then played 45 minutes without him, and were also quite bad, and it finished 0-1. This doesnt mean that Fellaini was single handedly responsible for our heroic shutting out of Southampton in the first half (yes, that is sarcasm), but it means that clearly he is not the root of all our problems as several here suggest.

The cherry on top is that the goal we eventually conceded was the exact situation that Fellaini has dealt with time and time again in recent weeks - a defensive set piece. As ever, football is not without a sense of irony.

2205~~~
What concerned me today is that Fellaini played no worse than he has in any other games this season, but LvG actually subbed him... at half time. It just reassures to me that LvG hasn't got a clue how to resolve this mess.

2206~~~
Aye, he's been riding on the crest of a wave in regards to that form for a long, long time. He was consistently <i>better </i>than he has been in his other two seasons in 2014/15, but his actual very good spell, wherein he looked like a genuinely very good footballer, was incredibly short-lived and not so coincidentally came at a period in which our side as a whole was playing very well. Or, in other words, he managed to do what Cleverley and Anderson did at the start of 2011/12.

2207~~~
Yeah that just about sums him up really. Puts shift in but he just doesn't have anything about him to be good enough in CM for a team like United. Still infuriating though how many times he fails to win a header for his size.

He seems a good lad and is an effective player in the right set-up, but having said that to be honest i am sick of watching this guy play. If i woke up tomorrow and find out we had sold him to China or something i wouldn't bat an eyelid. He just doesn't offer us anything that we really need.

2208~~~
There's an annoying recurrence that whenever Fellaini is criticised, his supporters will often start to claim that he's being scapegoated. A scapegoat implies that he's being criticised at the <i>expense </i>of others, which is evidently nonsensical when Rooney, Darmian and Depay have also all come in for heavy criticism, with even players like Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Mata, Lingard and others all getting criticism at times of poor form. There's a tendency to make it look as if Fellaini is being singled out, when in reality it's just not the case.

Meh, he was excellent, yeah, but he was one of many good players. De Gea was consistently our best player. Herrera was very good. Smalling began to look like a top defender. Blind had a very good spell at left-back. Carrick found some of his best form again. Fellaini was excellent, but he was a good performer in a team that was playing incredibly well, like Cleverley or Anderson in 2011/12. And like them, he's been suspiciously poor in comparison when we're not playing well. He had a good 2014/15 season, but it gets massively overplayed when his very best form happened to come at a time when the team as a whole was playing well. He's never really consistently delivered when the chips have been down.

2209~~~
FFS, just when you thought Walrus couldn't get more cringeworthy.  Have a word with yourself, you silly girl.

2210~~~
When did giving it "a good go" become enough to play for Utd?! 
I'm totally shit at football but would bust a gut to play for Utd. I can only hope you'd share the same blind faith if I was ridiculously part of the Utd squad!

2211~~~
We didn't have a control either when was out. To the contrary, we were worse.

Fellaini was benched a lot in the start of the season. Why then he found his place back in the team? Well, because others didn't perform and LVG was trying to make some changes. That's what he tried today with Mata, but what did Mata contribute today (or in general this season)? Not much really. Thing is, Mata and Herrera are undoubtedly better players than Fellaini, but when it comes to the bottom line they are not contributing more. We barely score goals with and without Fellaini in the team.

What people like Walrus and myself are saying is simple: he hasn't been great today or this season. But who has (barring Martial, maybe)? Why then keep criticizing him that much when he is not the problem? In this respect:

Fellaini didn't start in our 0-0 draws with Newcastle, City, Palace, PSV and Chelsea.
Fellaini didn't start in our losses to Swansea, PSV and Arsenal.
Fellaini didn't start in our 1-1 draws with CSKA and Leicester.

See, many games that ended without a win without Fellaini starting (sometimes not even playing as a sub). When you look at the full picture, it's really bad. The team is just playing badly!

2212~~~
Nonsense.

That is all. I'm not saying he's a good player, even, but ostracising him because he's not good enough is plain pathetic.

2213~~~
Where did I say he was good enough?

I said, and quite clearly so, that practically ridiculing a player because he's not deemed good enough is a prick move.

2214~~~
I don't even post in this thread anymore mate (the last one was probably the first in months IIRC). So not exactly space-goating anyone to be fair. Merely pointing out that everything doesn't have to be qualified relative to other players in a faint-praise kind of way. Hypothetical scenario - Memphis had a bad game, but marginally better than Marouane... Do people routinely qualify an assessment with - 'well atleast he was better than Fellaini so that's something to feel good about'? Nope. Wayne, similar. One wouldn't find a lot of comments from his backers (or whatever) to the effect of - 'yep he was crap, but atleast not as much as Fellaini'? Very rarely, if ever. But, no time is wasted in pointing out other bad players if Fellaini isn't the worst of the lot. It just seems weird in a counter compensatory reverse bias sort of way is all.
See this is exactly what I'm talking about mate. So, the criticism is best accounted for by dragging other players through the mud too? Take the higher road? You think Fellaini gets a disproportionate level of grief, and that's fair enough. But why do you feel compelled to name Januzaj or Lingard or whoever? People are less harsh on youngsters (one of whom had just returned from loan, and the other from injury). Maybe that's the reason for it. Maybe others get a pass (relative term since almost everyone incurs our wrath these days - including the likes of Schneiderlin, Darmian and co. - who are more recent additions, compared with Fellaini who has been here since 2013) for aesthetic reasons (subjective as that may sound). Also, there's no reason to highlight match-going fans with " ". Those people pay up a good amount of money to support their team, they are well versed with the ethos of the club and the type of gifted players we had in the past, a lot of them have been supporting the club from close quarters all their lives, and they are exceedingly displeased (what with us laboring to score a grand total of 1 goal in 12 first halves - or some ridiculous number like that), and they can cheer/ jeer whoever they please, and they certainly don't need anymore permission or judgement.

2215~~~
He's like Marouane, he's just ill suited to United, but he'd be a decent player in the right set up.

2216~~~
It was more than that. Even in the Chelsea match we lost he was one of our better performers.

2217~~~
Spot on guys. He's absolutely woeful as a central midfielder. One of the absolute worst in the league.

2218~~~
Not good enough for United. Expect him to be sold in the summer.

2219~~~
He simply doesn't fit the team. He doesn't fit the way we play now and he certainly doesn't fit how we all want United to play. He's not a likable fellow on the pitch either wit his studs up challenges, needless fouls and elbows flying everywhere. The Jackson 5 are long gone despite how much he wants to cling to that era. Lastly, he's Moyes' only summer transfer and the epitome of SAF's transition onto other managers which frankly has been dreadful so far.

If not for footballing reasons he should be shipped on for sentimental reasons alone.

2220~~~
There's more than enough footballing reasons, though. 

His touch is average, his passing is poor, he's slow and isn't a good defender.

Is tall and can control ball with chest, shouldn't be enough to be at Manchester United. The standards need to rise.

2221~~~
The only role he can do well is the pseudo striker playing as the AM thing he was doing last season. As a CM, he isn't good enough for the likes of Everton or Liverpool, let alone a team with bigger ambitions. We have a bang average player and play him in a role which brings out the worst in him.

2222~~~
He is being scapegoated. Absolutely no doubt. Also, when Mata is shite, it's because we don't have Herrera in there or because we don't have Usain Bolt up top. When Herrera is shite it's because Mata is not there. When Depay is shite it's because Shaw is injured or he's playing through the middle. When Schneiderlin is shite it's because LVG has instructed him to never ever do anything productive with the ball or because he's playing alongside Fellaini. When Schweinstriger plays shite it's because LVG has no clue how to use him.

When Fellaini plays shite, it's because he's fecking shite and should be sold asap and is responsible for all the ills befalling Manchester United. Also, it's now fashionable to pretend he only had 3 good games last season.

But it's obvious people have had a thing against him from the moment we signed him and won't pass a chance to have digs at him. People were giddy when LVG signed on as the manager and there were multiple essays from serial bullshitters (You know who you are!) outrageously well versed in LVG's philosophy explaining in painful details on how Fellaini wouldn't fit LVG's teams. Ten months later Fellani was a key player in us getting top 4. Guess that must have hit some of them quite hard...

2223~~~
Sell already.

2224~~~
Agree, we should sell all of LVG's signings as well so we actually pretend we've never let Ferguson go, let's get Giggsy and Scholesy back on the pitch.

2225~~~
It's because LVG hates playing Herrera as a central midfielder, which is in itself bizarre. Herrera as a midfielder and Fellaini further makes a whole lot more sense to me.

2226~~~
Is 'he's fecking shit, sell him' discussing his performances?

Herrera is being brought up in his thread by the people you tell to do one because he's constantly brought up in 'why is Herrera not playing but this sack of shit is' arguments. At the same time our darling is playing just as shit as the oaf this season and escapes criticism for some reason. The anti-Fellaini bias was perfectly illustrated by bosnian_red (no offence mate, got nothing personal against you obviously) in that sense that we shouldn't criticise our players because they've been Vangalised <b>unless</b> they're Fellaini/Rooney/whoever the next escape goat is because they're ultimately shit and there's no help and we should sell.

Constantly peddling 'useless, get rid' bullshit in this thread and not liking a player are two different things. It's fine not to like a player, talking constant shit is not. It's hilarious to watch how precious people get when you apply the same rules to, e.g. already mentioned, Herrera.

<a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> pretty much summed it up above.

2227~~~
Yup. Unfortunately someone like Herrera seems to be classified as too much of a risk taker for his CM. Ridiculous really.

2228~~~
The thing about Fellaini is, can you ever see him as being more than a plan B? With all the other players you mentioned people have hope they will develop / find previous form and become fixtures in the team. It doesn't excuse poor performances obviously, but people want to give the likes of Mata/Herrera/Memphis/Schmidfield the benefit of the doubt in the hopes of reaping the reward one day. Fellaini doesn't provide that.

2229~~~
That's not the point I was making. fwiw I don't even think Fellaini is very good but there's clear double standards in the way he's judged compared to everyone else and what's more bizarre is this is coming off the back of a season where he was a key player in finishing top 4. Herrers has been dogshit yet all I see in this thread on how it's everyone else's fault he's not playing well. Fellaini never gets that benefit of doubt. When he has a bad game, the knives and pitchforks are out immediately.

2230~~~
I agree about the double standards, I'm trying to explain why that is. People want to see the best in Herrera because he's the kind of player if he came good would be a regular fixture for us. There are few who actively<i> want</i> to see Fellaini play well since he isn't the player they want in the team long term anyway.

2231~~~
Each player should be judged on their individual merits, displays, age, potential, etc...

Anyway, Fellaini...He's not fit to play for United.

2232~~~
I don't think it's double standards when you consider that Fellaini should be regarded as one of the most experienced midfielders in the PL as opposed to Herrera who is just in his second season in England. Fellaini is almost 30, the average age for a midfielder in their prime. I think more should be expected of him. It's the same way Rooney will get less slack.from me than Depay or Lingard would. That is fair IMO.

2233~~~
Times up for him here, he needs to be sold in the summer. He's more of a hindrance to us than anything.

2234~~~
It doesn't even have to be a bad game. He can have an average game and still they will come out. 

Anyway I agree with a lot of what you are saying.

2235~~~
It's funny how people who defend Fellaini here mention Herrera all the time despite Fellaini being hardly mentioned in the Herrera thread, especially because their strongest argument is that Herrera is defended a lot by saying he is poor because he plays alongside Fellaini. The other argument is that he isn't playing any worse than Herrera. Some irony.

Best to stay away from this thread.

2236~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a>

I understand what you are saying - but like I said in my previous post, the only <i>reason</i> I was bringing other players into it was to attempt to demonstrate how disproportional the amount of criticism/abuse Fellaini receives is (compared with others).

I cant speak for other posters, but for myself, I have resorted to using those arguments (ie ones involving other players) because quite simply it seems impossible to have a genuine discussion on Fellaini as a player with most of his critics here, because there always seems to be this irrational and blind hatred of the guy, such that even if he scored a hattrick people would be picking holes in his performances.

For whats its worth, and I have stated this before - I dont think Fellaini should be a starter for us in the current system. I liked him in the 4-3-3 last year but feel he lacks the positional discipline to play a holding role, and lacks the creativity to play as a #10. Fellaini, Herrera and a holding mid (Schneiderlin or Carrick) however does have the potential to be a very good/balanced midfield trio if deployed in the right way.

You asked to discuss Fellaini's merits, so I will bite and state what I think he brings to the team;

First and the most obvious thing is physicality. We can debate until the cows come home as to whether a team <i>should</i> or <i>does</i> require a physical presence, my opinion is that in the PL, virtually every title winning team has had a bit of bite/steel/strength. It was considered Arsenal's great weakness for many years that they lacked those qualities (along with a proper DM and Keeper) and that was what prevented them winning the league. Fellaini is an effective target for long balls and clearances <i>when we need to </i>(this doesnt mean that we should be playing hoofball, obviously), and is a strong asset when defending set pieces (again - if Fellaini had been on the pitch then I am not convinced that Southampton score that goal in the 87th minute yesterday).

When I talk about physicality I dont just mean height - I also mean a combative attitude. The game against Liverpool is a good recent example where Fellaini was frankly the only one in our midfield and attack who was prepared to stand up to the Scouse bullyboys like Lucas and Henderson. Without wanting to bring other players into it - I find it ridiculous that in the past we have praised other players (eg Rafael vs Tevez) for showing a bit of fight, especially in the derby games, but with Fellaini he gets roundly criticised by a lot of the fans for doing effectively the same thing.

While I am speaking of attitude, it bares mentioning that over his time at United Fellaini has taken a lot of stick from the fans. The fact that he came back last season and put in good performances consistently - becoming one of our best outfield players that season - shows that he has the right mentality and attitude to play at a top club. A lot of people seem to take this for granted, but we have seen time and time again players who are supremely technical gifted, but fail to make the grade. Ferguson wrote and spoke extensively about how important mentality was for him when recruiting players, and I firmly believe that when it comes to attitude/mentality, Fellaini is virtually a perfect example of having the right mindset; he doesnt give up, he doesnt go into his shell if things arent going well, he doesnt allow himself or the team to be bullied, he keeps battling until the last minute, he doesnt allow boos and jibes from the stands to affect him.

On a related topic to the above, Fellaini has also appeared to demonstrate that he is capable of carrying out the managers specific instructions very well. Whilst as fans we can never know with absolute certainty what goes on behind closed doors, I recall last season the clip in the West Brom game before Fellaini was brought on, where LVG was talking to him and clearly relaying instructions. Fellaini came on, delivered an excellent performance and scored a goal to level the game for us - he then started something like the next 8 games. He played roles including man-marking an opponent (Fabregas vs Chelsea, a game where Fellaini won MotM - and not in the fashionable "3 game streak" that the critics love to reference), playing high up the pitch as a target man or second striker, and the "inside left" position in our 4-3-3. The point here is simply that LVG has spoken plenty of times about how he likes players to be intelligent, that he likes them to make their own decisions on the pitch etc - and he appears to trust Fellaini in this capacity.

Next up is work rate. I find it utterly baffling that people in this thread have come out saying that Fellaini is lazy. I dont have statistics for this but would be very interested to see the amount of ground covered by players over 90 minutes, because the role Fellaini has been playing for us is essentially box-to-box, and one that requires a lot of running and energy. Fellaini presses the opponents back line (less so recently due to being deployed in a deeper role admittedly), presses the midfielders and defends a lot around our box. Furthermore, we have seen in recent weeks that Fellani has obviously been instructed at times to go back and assist the CBs - Blind in particular - at defending long balls or against physical strikers (this is an example of what I spoke about in the previous paragraph). It is noticeable to me how often Fellaini is back inside our penalty area to make defensive headers - easily moreso than our other midfielders. The notion that he is lazy is one that I find truly ludicrous, with this in mind.

While talking about footballing intelligence (again, something Fellaini is often criticised over), it is worth noting that Fellaini is a player who seems to know and appreciate his own limitations. He doesnt try to play 60-yard raking passes because it isnt his game. He gets criticised if he plays a sideways pass, but realistically if he has players like Herrera next to him, then surely it is a good decision to lay off the ball to a more creative player/better passer? There isnt anything wrong with this - it is in fact the same thing we used to see Michael Carrick do when he was alongside Paul Scholes - simply the acknowledgement that another player may be able to do more with the ball than you can. With that said I do not believe Fellaini is technically deficient at all. We keep seeing the old Bayern Munich clip getting roled out of Fellaini apparently running the ball out of play, and it is an area of his game which is once again exaggerated. Fellaini is not afraid to drive forward with the ball, he tends to play a simple passing game for the most part, but we have also seen him bust out some pirouettes and fancy flick-ons and backheels at times. You ask not to bring up other players - but consider someone like Valencia, who has managed to get to a club like United despite virtually not having a left foot, and having a trademark "shin buster" cross. Other examples exist, but the point here is simply that Fellaini is nowhere near as bad technically as many make him out to be - it is more that he tends to play a simple passing game and take the low risk options because he has more creative players alongside him.


I would like to conclude by saying that I do <i>not</i> believe that Fellaini is a future Ballon d'Or winner, nor do I believe he should be a regular starter for United in the current system. He is however, a valuable member of our squad, he has unique characteristics - some of which are sorely lacking amongst our other players, and has shown that he is able to be a very good player for a team at our level. The abuse and level of criticism he receives is completely unjustified and disproportionate to his actual performances, and that is reflected on the Caf by this thread and his match ratings.

2237~~~
Was very poor on the ball today. But you have to remember that he won us the game vs liverpool and that we lost this game to a header, a situation that would have been greatly improved if he was on the pitch. Anyone who thinks he's on the pitch for his CM passing is nuts. He's on the pitch because of set plays, at both ends. He has played the worst football of his career with the ball at his feet these last few weeks though. Shouldn't be in the side until that improves dramatically

2238~~~
You're being massively selective here though. Certain posters will argue that Mata and Herrera playing poorly is due to other factors, while certain posters will argue it's just because they're not very good. A bit like with Fellaini; who has his detractors, but also has multiple posters willing to defend him. The concept that he's being scapegoated in order to save other players from criticism is utter nonsense, unless you want to argue that no one else on the forum is coming in for regular criticism.

And it's a bit rich when as <a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> said, it's often Fellaini's supporters who will try to defend him by dragging others players into the mud.

2239~~~
Definitely. It gets incredibly tiresome, and is pretty much blatant fanboyism; wherein fans will ardently defend one player, even at the expense of others. It's impossible for them to make any criticism of Fellaini without a <i>but</i>, which often involves throwing someone else under the bus.

Which is a massive problem. For all he offers us with his heading (and it's not as much as it should be), we're losing out on a <i>lot </i>if we have a midfield player who isn't good enough as a passer. Even more so when our manager wants us to actually be a possession based team.

2240~~~
Column

I appreciate your comment on Fellaini but a lot of it is a very overrated.

2241~~~
Yeah, I admire his attempts to defend Fellaini, but much of it is dramatically over the top. A whole paragraph on following instructions, for example...which I'm pretty sure the vast majority of decent footballers do. And another on his footballing intelligence...because he recognises he isn't a good passer so shifts it to better ones, as if that's some heralded virtue.

2242~~~
No, he is actually spot on. Fair and balanced.

2243~~~
Odd thing is, we saw what Fellaini brings to the team when used to his strengths, last season. He was a vital part of our plan A.

2244~~~
When he was in the best form of his United career, sure. It was never going to last. Also, last season's team (although better than this season's edition) was not at the standard United should be at.

2245~~~
Not even close to being spot on and even if it were true anything he does bring to the team is massively out weighed by everything you lose by playing him, over the course of nearly three seasons we have seen that with the exception of a handful of performances.

The good thing is once other players are back he will be moved back to the bench and will only see him in high be plan b (although it virtually never works, especially as he loses more aerial duels than he wins this season). Unless we reappoint moyes in the summer he will be move on.

2246~~~
Why's that?

Last seasons United was only a few players away from being a really good team.

2247~~~
The reason the criticism with regards to Fellaini is a bit disproportionate is because:

A) His bottom level is one of the lowest at United. 

B) He's a terrible fit for a club of United's standing let alone not good enough.

2248~~~
Top form never does, that's why it's your top form. Outside the Spurs-Liverpool-City run, when did Fellaini ever show that level of performance (substitute cameos not counting) ?

Agree the team did not need too many players to be at a sufficient level, but then, I still hold that view for this team. Just the tactics need to be markedly changed.

2249~~~
Early on in the season, he was quite impressive. Liverpool and Chelsea at home and WBA away come to mind.

2250~~~
I had a different judgment of his performances then. Don't remember WBA away but I didn't think he was anything special in the Liverpool or Chelsea games.

2251~~~
He scored a screamer against WBA, as well as being pivotal in salvaging a point. Chelsea at home, both he and Mata were really good in midfield. Fellaini handled Matic exceptionally well. Against Pool, at home, it was a really good team performance where everyone played their part. I should also add that he was equally impressive against City, away.

2252~~~
He made the header that lead to the equalizer of RVP late in the Chelsea game and he defended virtually every attack of Liverpool. He also made a great pass to Rooney that led to our second goal against Arsenal in the 2-1 win, all of those in the first half of the season. Oh, and he scored the equalizer against WBA after coming in as a substitute.

2253~~~
I guess I judge his performances more as a midfielder? The Liverpool game I felt was not a great team performance despite the score, really it was DDG who kept us in it with 3 fantastic saves. Chelsea game it was Di Maria's run that got Ivanovic sent off that really made the opening for the goal. I don't deny Fellaini made contributions, but as an attacker more than anything else, and we should be aspiring to more in that position. Maybe I am judging him too harshly though.

2254~~~
I really disagree with this - I think his bottom level is actually quite high compared with most. Even when he is playing badly and/or the team is having a bad day, he will still put himself about, offer a strong aerial presence in defence and try to get on the end of things going up the pitch.

Compare this to other players - if Herrera or Schneiderlin is having a bad game, they are often completely anonymous (as has been the case recently). I would argue that their bottom level - in terms of what they offer and bring to the team, and the impact they have on a game - is lower than Fellainis, and I would apply the same to many others. Because of his rather unique characteristics, Fellainis still has attributes which remain useful regardless of form and performance. I also think that this is why he is rarely substituted if he starts a game, because (as the Southampton goal arguably showed) he can always be an asset defending set pieces (as one example).

<a class="username" data-user="62577, @Cheesy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/62577/">@Cheesy</a> I feel the need to be explicit with some of these sorts of things simply because others will just dismiss them out of hand if I am not. I am referring to things like the "carrying instructions onto the pitch" point from my earlier post - that I try to give examples to back up my points, hence why it ended up as an entire paragraph.

<a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> i have stated my reasoning for why I think Fellaini is still a useful player for us. Instead of just saying that I am exaggerating, and calling him shit (yet again) why don't you actually try to make an objective, insult-and-exaggeration-free, unbiased appraisal of the player. I invite other Fellaini critics to do the same.

2255~~~
If by quite impressive you mean he was completely average by every footballing standard, then yes, he was quite impressive. He's not good enough for this level of football.

The only thing he can really do on the pitch is play as an old school target man to fish long balls and either bring them down or assist teammates. Not United or top class football.

2256~~~
Jose Mourinho here: Mata is not a Chelsea player or top class football.

LVG a year ago: well, you're wrong Jose.
LVG now: Juan, you're going to stay on the bench today.

2257~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2258~~~
I'm not being selective at all. There are loads of posters who will make multiple excuses for other players and not offer the same for Fellaini. It's quite obvious in here.

The bit in bold is hogwash. There are loads of people blaming Fellani for the form of plenty of other players. And then there's the stat about Fellaini which peole keep bringing up. As if we haven't been shite without Fellaini.

2259~~~
Doesn't the stat you're talking about pretty much prove the opposite? Results wise, at least.

2260~~~
I didn't say he was shit or insult him that you lose a lot by playing him, which you do and there is no need to elaborate because it's plain as day and is the reason why no one other than moyes would pay his buyout from Everton. You are too over sensitive when it comes to fellaini, he isn't a good enough player, he wasn't before we signed him, hasn't been since we did and won't be no matter how much you try to convince yourself and everyone else.

2261~~~
Which is the exact same in this thread...because there will be posters who continually refuse to criticise Fellaini, yet will happily shit all over other players. Or, in other words, our poorer performers have both people who continue to defend them, and people who will slate them. Fellaini isn't some sort of unique special snowflake in that regard.

And the part about other players just isn't blatantly true. There was a brief period where people tried to excuse Schneiderlin's form because he was playing beside Fellaini, but the mentions of Fellaini in other threads is comparatively minimal to, say, the mentions of Herrera in this one. Search for Herrera, and see how often people are bringing him up. People will quite happily drag other players under the mud in order to excuse Fellaini, and seem determined to prove that there is some larger agenda against him when many posters just think he's a bit shit and isn't good enough for us.

2262~~~
Fellaini was rated MotM by the Caf vs Chelsea, but had a fairly average rating against Pool and City. Certainly nothing like his form (and the team's) in that later run.

2263~~~
It proves feck all. Liverpool fans loved bringing up the stat which showed they had better win rate without Suarez to prove they weren't reliant on him.

2264~~~
In the bold - who exactly are those posters? Even if they do exist they will quite comfortably be in the minority. Every game without fail, regardless of Fellaini's performances, there's always someone chipping in with "He's shite and should be sold".

It is quite true. Which is why you had loads of posters pushing the Fellaini stat.

2265~~~
You, Walrus, and ZDwyr are some of his main defenders. And that's fine: you're perfectly entitled to hold that opinion, and it's always good for some differing opinions. And yeah, you're a minority, but I don't think there's any other average player in our squad who gets religiously backed to the extent that Fellaini does by his own supporters, who will immediately jump onto his attackers with ridiculous, over the top, melodramatic defences, attacking other players in the process, with this seemingly persistent belief that he's some unique snowflake who's getting unwarranted criticism because he's a scapegoat...when it's not the case at all. He's just an immensely average footballer, who has been getting comments which indicate many feel that way. Yeah, there <i>are </i>some over the top comments, and posters who will endlessly slate him even when he's alright, but then that's still the case for other players, namely Depay and Darmian for example.

And I don't see anything wrong with someone bringing up the Fellaini stat, presuming you're talking about our record with/without him. Yeah, he's far from the sole reason as to our decline, and it'd be nonsensical to suggest so, but I don't see anything wrong with people highlighting that our form without him is better than our form with him. Certainly, he doesn't do our midfield any favours as far as controlling the game/creating chances goes when he plays there.

2266~~~
I called him shit as recently as yesterday and have repeatedly said he's not good enough and wouldn't care if he was sold.

And you must be kidding me. Fellaini gets backed? There are people on this thread who seem to genuinely believe Fellaini is barely championship standard never mind United standard. People come across as "defenders" because half they are dealing with ridiculously over the top nonsense from posters. He's also the least excused player in the squad. In fact people go out of their way to point out his flaws.

The stat is utterly pointless and ignores any sort of context. Our performances have been shit with and without Fellaini.

2267~~~
My view roughly mirrors <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> 's, although I obviously rate Fellaini <i>slightly</i> higher than him. A <b>lot</b> of posters on here go completely over the top with their criticism of Fellani, never even entertain the notion of giving him the benefit of the doubt etc... I could go on but it has all been said before.

2268~~~
Well no, it proves that we've done worse with Fellaini in the team than without him. That much is abundantly clear.

What you should be pointing out is that it does little to explain <i>why </i>we have done worse with him than without him. I suspect your argument would be that it has very little to do with Fellaini and we've had problems that go beyond him, which isn't a bad point at all. But even his staunchest supporters would surely agree that he's not playing particularly well and when the stats undeniably show we're worse off when he plays than when he doesn't I don't think its a stretch to say he's making us worse. 

In the context of his United career as a whole which again, pandering to his defenders, at <i>best </i>consists of one bad season, one good one, and baring a major turn around, another bad one I don't think anyone is 'agenda posting' by suggesting that thats not good enough.

2269~~~
yeah van gaal is an idiot for not putting one of the fit top CMs we had in there instead of him

2270~~~
I think the reason a lot of people on here don't like him is due to him joining with Moyes and being seen as part of that whole debacle. The reason I really dislike him is because I hated him as a player when he was at Everton (the whole way they played was part of the reason I hated Moyes from the start... all tied together). He's a dirty player, always elbows people, and all his qualities are suited to a style that people don't want to see at United. That's basically the bulk of why people don't like him. To get the best out of him, we need to play a style people don't want to see at United.

Not sure what benefit of doubt he needs to get? Everyone knows what he can provide like he did for Belgium and Everton. We know what he can and can't do basically.

2271~~~
It's got feck all to do with him being signed by Moyes and everything to do with him being a miserable player in pretty much every single way humanly possible.

2272~~~
Fellaini reminds me of when you turn passing from 'assisted' to 'manual' on Fifa.

2273~~~
Genuinely think De Gea would do better in midfield. He's actually more suited to the role Fellaini has been given. His chest control and shooting might not be as good but we're not seeing any of that from Fellaini at CDM anyway. Dave's passing and ball control are definitely superior.

2274~~~
Sick of this clown

2275~~~
He has been frustrating. He's been involved in some good stuff, but by God has he given away some horrible passes too.

2276~~~
Something is genuinely wrong if we have to play with Fellaini in midfield. Please sell as soon as possible.

2277~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I try not to criticize him too much and unjustly but fact of it is he's really not a Manchester United quality footballer. Unless we're striving around the 7-4 positions in the table.

2278~~~
Honest to God. Why does the sack of s&!t need to nudge him there? Jump and try to win the header you moron.

2279~~~
What frustrates me most with him is he's not even average in the air, he's just shit.

Yet he gets picked for his 'ariel ability'.

2280~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2281~~~
Good half by Fellaini.

2282~~~
Welcome to redcafe Mrs. Fellaini.

2283~~~
A man who is mad for possession persisting with someone who continuously gives it away. Bizarre.

2284~~~
His passing is absolutely horrendous.

2285~~~
He is bad in the air, and its supposed to be his best feature.

2286~~~
Had a couple of rubbish passes but Schneiderlin was at fault for their goal and did barely anything going forward, Fellaini was involved in a couple of bits of play that could have been goals at least. Average Fellaini performance and poor by Schneiderlin but as usual Marouane is the spacegoat.

2287~~~
He's not a scapegoat. He just wasn't good. Neither was Schneiderlin, but he has potential to be a decent United player. Fellaini doesn't. Ever. Gave the ball away constantly, gave away at least 2 needless fouls - one of them when he should be jumping for a header. Yes, he did have a couple of moments that were decent, but the bad as always far outweighed the good.

2288~~~
Trying to chest that down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2289~~~
I don't understand how anyone can see how much space his leaving for Derby to attack. It's not Schneiderlin fault he has to cover for this donkey. He is not a midfielder or a football of such.

2290~~~
You have to be pretty bloody stupid to still think that Fellaini isn't instructed to get up the pitch by LVG.

2291~~~
All the open play stuff he's been typically useless. But he's won almost every corner he's been defending. 

I guess that's his only purpose in this team.

2292~~~
Good performance today. Two good chances that he created in a addition to very good defending.

2293~~~
Same as most of his games this season.

2294~~~
Not been bad tonight, dare I say he's played acceptable?

2295~~~
By far our best midfielder today, Mata and Schneiderlin looked like school boys compared to him.

2296~~~
Useful for defensive headers at least.

2297~~~
It got glossed over of course, but he was substituted in the Southampton game and we ended up conceding a header from a set piece. Tonight he has yet again defended pretty much every corner we have conceded, not for the first time - I am sure this is a big part of why LVG rarely subs him.

2298~~~
He was good today.

2299~~~
Just like he was instructed to get up the pitch by Moyes.

2300~~~
5.5 average rating at the minute... Are people just used to giving him shit ratings? I'm not saying he had a blinder but he deserves higher than that.

2301~~~
Playing him in a midfield 2 is the same as playing a midfield 1 as he is positionally one of the worst CM's I've ever seen. He did more with the ball than Schneiderlin though and won some good defesnive headers on set pieces.

2302~~~
Sure he clears the ball with his head, but you expect more of a midfielder than that. Especially one playing in a midfield two, especially at United. It's not all his fault either, everyone knows what a limited player he is. We should be doing more to avoid being in this situation.

2303~~~
In the first half, he stood in the centre circle, with the ball at his feet, unchallenged for a minimum of 5 seconds. It felt like an eternity. Almost as if he could have had a fag and made a phone call.

Simply put, he'll never get a game as easy as that in centre midfield again in his life. Let alone at Manchester United.

He's still not good enough to start for us in CM in the Prem though.

2304~~~
He is a pub player I don't get it ?

2305~~~
Was busy today and had a good game overall.

2306~~~
Two headers from corners that was it apart from that he was lucky to get 5.5 its nothing to do with getting used to giving shit ratings , he in my opinion is the worst player I have seen play for United and I've seen a lot ha ha

2307~~~
Yeah, Schneiderlin definitely had to cover for Fellaini, which was by design. Still unbalances the team and left us open to that sucker punch. 

The Fellaini Gambit works at times (i.e. target man/out ball), but he tends to be a liability when the ball is on the ground. Plus him playing rather high also crowds out the space that guys like Mata need to be more effective, while his passing range using his feet is really limited. When we are on defense, he is easily bypassed, but is great asset on corners when he is placed properly. 

Not sure if I want him starting so many games. Granted, a lot of them were due to injuries & suspension, but I'd rather wish he was a better defensive midfielder.

2308~~~
You must have been supporting since the 2014 season in that case. There are tons of players who've been worse than Fellaini over the years....the Djemba twins, Kleberson, Smith.....the list goes on and on. Talk about exaggerating to try and make a point....

2309~~~
He was good today.

2310~~~
this

2311~~~
This comment pops up from time to time and is so lazy. He clearly isn't a pub player. He isn't the worst player in the PL and he isn't even the worst player at United......if you don't like how he plays or what he's all about, fair enough but say why you don't like him rather than this pub nonsense.

2312~~~
He's horrible to watch, is seen as the symbol of the start of our decline and in truth has no business playing for a team claiming to be one of Europe's elite, but he's been better than Schneiderlin the last couple of games.

2313~~~
I think he is neat and tidy with good technique and keeps things ticking along. Decent in both boxes too. He's short of pace tho so needs more pace and mobility around him really. He might not be pleasing on the eye but I don't mind that. A team needs lots of different components to be effective and as long as we don't have a team full of Fellainis, I'm happy with what he brings to the party.

2314~~~
He can't play as part of a midfield two, it's no surprise that regardless of who his partner is they struggle next to him.

2315~~~
He was quite good today.

2316~~~
He was perfectly fine today. Obviously the level of opposition wasn't great but he was far from our worst player.

2317~~~
I'd agree with that
Hes not a midfielder. 
Hes a good way of bypassing midfield and handy around the box 
but if your looking for decent possession in the opposition half he's just a bit hopeless.

He did his job well today all the same. It was never going to be pretty with that midfield.

2318~~~
My only consolation after seeing him start is that we're one game closer to his exit.

2319~~~
Alan Smith was easily better than afroturd.

2320~~~
It's such a shame he simple doesn't fit into the team.

But it's not really his fault, you have to blame Moysee for creating this problem and to a lesser extend the Mata problem too.

2321~~~
Okay he was actually pretty decent today but I keep seeing this all the time and it's infuriating...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/y0qi" width="560"></iframe>

2322~~~
He was absolutely atrocious. Caused Schneiderlin more problems than the entire Derby team did and repeatedly lost the ball in completely unacceptablle scenarios. It looked like a drunk fan had won a competition to play in the team. I don't get you lot sometimes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2323~~~
Someone should do a montage of all his touches in this game and force everyone in this thread to watch it, with a reminder that he was supposed to be playing as a central midfielder.

I don't know if he's just getting pity points or what but feck me.

2324~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> you should post much more noods. Like reading your reviews and ratings <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Why did your stop your usual post match threads?

2325~~~
MoTM for me: Martial
Second in line: Fellaini

2326~~~
Agreed started a lot of attacks for us. However, some shitty touches and passes that he should be nailing ffs.

2327~~~
Hes shit. It took me two games to figure that out.

2328~~~
Totally agree. The lad is a make-up job & unicycle away from being an actual clown.

2329~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2330~~~
Nope, come on Noods, he was never that bad! I could understand if you'd said Mata looked like one of the ball boys having a knock about with the grown ups the way he was being rag dolled most of the game although he scored so fair fecks to him. That'll get him off the hook to a large degree. 

Fellaini did a lot of the donkey work and was an out ball to keep the team ticking over. A good team will always be better than the sum of its parts if everyone contributes something different which mostly happened last night, including the big fella......

2331~~~
I agree with noodlehair.  I must have been watching a different game than some of you.  Horrible performance, can't dribble or pass, and was beat in the air fair to often considering that's the only reason he's on the pitch (That and we don't have anyone else).  Can't believe how far we've come that this type of performance is hailed by some.

2332~~~
I agree, you must have been! It seems that you and others are expecting Fellaini to be a certain type of player and are then judging him by those standards rather than appreciating what he is actually bringing to the team. I like watching him generally tbh and certainly appreciate him. I wouldn't want a team full of Fellaini's but then I wouldn't have wanted a team full of Vidic's either.

Whoever said that he was a defensive midfielder (think it may have been Moyes) has really done him a disservice as he is not that. He doesn't have that foot speed or ability to sniff out/read danger. Cue sarky comments here but there aren't many players like big Felli. He brings a lot of power to the team, is a good link man, causes chaos in the opposition's box and helps out in ours. Kind of like powerful, defensive, attacking No.10....if there could ever be such a thing. I think he's valuable to us used the right way....which is not as a Plan B target man.

None of that is to say I don't want us to invest in more and better midfielders but it is a squad game these days and I think he's worth his place.

2333~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2334~~~
One of his better games but, the problem I think is he's being given this role where he is neither an attacker or a defensive mid which leads to him not helping Schneiderlin and he isn't in the box to get on the end of crosses. He is not a dribbler or passer - so obviously he is not going to light up the game. Hopefully now that Carrick is back, he'll either play behind the striker or not at all because in his current role, he is just not what we need in there.

2335~~~
He was shocked that Zorro has been suddenly attacking him. But I agree. Ronaldo he is not.

2336~~~
I like the lad and normally tend to defend him but this comment is really funny.

2337~~~
Spot on!

2338~~~
Lol, yeah, I have a feeling I might end up nicking that one and passing it off as my own at some stage....

2342~~~
A unicycle would probably improve his balance.

2343~~~
Yeah, I agree with you and if we're going to try play him like that then we need to have Ander playing too, similar to how the played last season. Fellaini looked like he was trying to play a similar role to that but without Ander on the other side to compensate that it completely unbalances the midfield. I thought he did a pretty good job of linking up with Martial, giving him an option and occupying defenders to create space for Martial to make his dribbles into the box which I think he has struggle with lately being isolated making it too easy for defenders to box him out.

2344~~~
Indeed and LVG highlighted this in the post match interview.
LVG basically was kicking himself for taking off Fellaini and I doubt he'll be doing that in a hurry, again.
This is why, for LVG, after Rooney and maybe DDG, Fellaini is the most important player and fans need to get used to this.

LVG's main objective is to concede zero goals. This enables us to get a draw (if we don't score) or 1-0 win (assuming that we score 1 goal, in line with our average).

I think that the main reason we lost so many games in December was because LVG was bowing to pressure to attack and this completely threw his tactic out of the window, which meant that we were conceding more goals, but needed to score ourselves - which we are unable to do against decent sides.

Summary: I don't like Fellaini, only because he enforces LVGs very negative tactic of trying to win games 1-0. BUT LVG needs Fellaini to enforce his negative tactic.

2345~~~
We are conceeding awful lot goals with Fellaini in the side, stop imagining things.

Ever since he started his "run" against Wolfsburg our defence looks terrible, mostly because we don't have any control in midfield when he plays.

Since he started his run against Wolfsburg, with him as a starter we conceeded 3 against wolfsburg, 2 against Bournemouth, 2 against Norwich, 2 against Stoke, 3 vs Newcastle, and one against Derby. He wasn't on the pitch/was substitued only before Wolfsburg's third goal, all other goals I mentioned we conceeded while he was on the pitch. We kept the clean sheet with him in the team only against Liverpool, game in which de Gea won MOTM, and home vs fecking West Ham - the game we haven't scored either.

The team is absolutely terrible defensively when he is in the team, we don't dominate games with him because he is no central midfielder. 
At least before we started playing him again our defence looked good, and we kind of dominated games, even though the problems in attack were the same. But at least we weren't conceeding lot, and our defenders actually looked good. Before his first start in december against West Ham we conceeded just two goals in 6 games, after that he started playing and we conceeded 6 goals in 4 games. Then again, he was benched for two games in PL and we conceeded one goal. In the next game he started we conceeded 3 vs Newcastle. Admittedly, in next two games we haven't conceeded with him on the pitch, but we were absolutely terrible in those two games(Liverpool and Soton) and could have conceeded at least goal or two against Liverpool if it wasn't for de Gea.

And those 1:0 or 0:0 results with Fellaini playing are obviously something you just invented considering just one 1:0 and two 0:0s happened with Fellaini as a starter, and both of those 0:0 were terrible result considering they were against West Ham and Southampton at Old Trafford.

2346~~~
<a class="username" data-user="54956, @Amar__" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54956/">@Amar__</a> Pretty much spot on. As much as Fellaini has plenty of height which can be useful when it comes to defending corners (and often is), it's negated by the fact that he his positional sense makes David Luiz look like Paolo Maldini. Not to mention that we <i>shouldn't </i>have to be relying on a central midfielder to be one of our main defensive players in our own penalty box. That should primary be the job of the defenders.

I do think <a class="username" data-user="88145, @sunama" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88145/">@sunama</a> makes a reasonable point as to what LVG's <i>intended </i>strategy is though. He'll see Fellaini's sporadic defensive contributions, and view them as being valuable. Because he believes it makes us better defensively...despite the fact that our defensive record doesn't really get any better.

2347~~~
I feel like a lot of you only remember the one or two aerial duels he loses in a game and ignore the ones he wins. There are a lot of comments like, "he always gets beat in the air" which is just not true at all.

2350~~~
He was that bad. Everyone I watched with was laughing at him. It's genuinely unbelievable that people watched the game and thought he was any better than awful. 

It is actually a pity thing isn't it? He played one half decent pass and headed the ball to a team mate a couple of times, so lets ignore the countless times he passed the ball to no one or lost the ball due to his complete inability to control it. Or his non existence in midfield, where he was supposedly playing. It's like when the bad kid in class throws a tantrum, rips up his homework, punches the teacher, but then gets a merit for spelling their name right on the detention form.

2351~~~
It was as good a performance as you're ever realistically going to get from fellaini in midfield. 
He made a lot of clearances and he had a couple of nice exchanges with martial. 
Schneiderlin and mata can take a share of credit for our midfield being anonymous yesterday anyway.

Not a fan of him there but thats as good as it gets with him in midfield.

2352~~~
He was pathetically bad. He is every tiime he plays there. 

As long as he is in our team, especially as a central midfielder, there is no point talking about pushing on or improving from where we currently are, because we'll always be a team struggling to cope with the burden of Fellaini. 

It might sound like I'm taking the piss but I'm not. That's genuinely where we're at with him. It is where we've been with him for some amount of time. 

There is no shape or control or flow to our play with Fellaini, there is only trying to find a way to struggle through the game.

2353~~~
See, I occasionally wANT to be kind to Fellaini and just cuddle his afro cause he seems like a cool guy, but then I see posts like this and they're pretty much spot on. We need to sell him to AC Milan. Or Kilmarnock.

2354~~~
or keep him. 

We're too soft without him. Morgan Schneiderlin didn't find himself well in the team yet, Bastian is injury prone and so is Michael Carrick!

2355~~~
It will be hilarious when some of our players are still shit once the big bad buffoon is sold and will no longer be able inhibit their outrageous ability by his mere presence.

Who will the next scapegoat be I wonder. Rooney is always a good bet but Lingard seems to be the current flavour of the month on the caf.

2356~~~
He isn't solely to be blamed for our struggles at all but him playing as a CM, pulls everyone down, there's no denying it. The guy's clueless there and it puts extra burden on whoever is partnering him. Schneiderlin, Carrick or BFS won't suddenly turn to Xavi if Fellaini wasn't next to him but atleast, they won't have to worry about covering for him half the time. Positioning, passing, mobility, awareness, the guy has nothing to play in CM.

2357~~~
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and he is currently our weakest link by a country mile. 
Its inevitable that no matter what team you line out, there are weaknesses, but I can't recall such a stand out weakness as Fellaini who's been persisted with by the inept manager. Even Fergie knew Bebe was crap and took it on the chin!

2358~~~
I've said since we signed him that as a CM he's a shocking player for our supposed level.

Even in this poor United side he stands out - and the criticism against him are the exact same that's been thrown his way since we signed him: Exactly what qualities does he bring to the team of any use, as a midfielder?

The answer to that question is none. Not a single one. He can't pass, can't defend, can't run, can't dribble, is quite stupid and lacks the footballing intelligence to function there, he's slow, he's a walking free kick and his technical level is quite simply embarrassing. And for all the talk of this "bite" he's going to bring, he's losing duels because of slow reactions and no balance - not winning them. He can't tackle either. He's not better at anything a midfielder is supposed to do than any random academy player getting thrown into the mix would be. 

If you ask what qualities he'd bring to the team as a supporting striker or a nuisance in the box, sure, he could have his uses. But that kind of option belongs at West Brom, not United. When we try this supposed plan B, what little is left of our game goes to shit. And even judging solely by that standard, as if that was all he's supposed to be judged by, he's been a disappointment - missing easy chances, losing every second aerial duel and so forth.

In short he's been a shocking player bar a couple of matches as our most advanced midfielder last spring, where basically his function was to bring down long hoofs and get Herrera/Mata on the ball.

Where are the clowns that told me that this man would be a good signing for United?

2359~~~
He didn't pull anyone down last season and he's not doing it this season. Everyone has been dogshit but Fellaini walks away with all the blame for some reason.

2360~~~
He was playing in a role that suits him best last season. Why would he pull others down? He was actually a big reason why we finished in the top 4. LVG seems to have erased the lessons learnt from last season from his memory though and is using him in a role which he's shit at to put it bluntly. It isn't even fellaini's fault, he can't say "I won't play because I'm not good enough there" when LVG picks him to play CM.

2361~~~
He's still playing the same role. Starting in midfield and breaking forward from there. The only difference is he hasn't hit the form of last season. Not sure how that excuses Schneideelin being incompetent with and without the ball.

2362~~~
It isn't the same role at all. Last season, the focus was on working the left channel and him moving into the box to score or assist with headers. Blind-Young-Fellaini is how it went most games. This season, he's playing as a proper CM initiating moves, staying deep to pass the ball and sometimes even being the deepest CM protecting the back 4. He does go on and try to get at the end of things at times but it's rare. With Young out of the team, we don't even have a dedicated man who tries to get crosses in for him to attack. 

Re Schneiderlin, as I said in my first post, his performance simply be excused because of his partner but when you have to cover for someone like Fellaini, it doesn't help at all. If schneiderlin is playing as the holding mid, having someone who's good with the ball whom he can pass it to would help. If he's playing b2b, having someone who's secure defensively would help too. Hell, just having someone mobile to partner him who'd just do his own share of the work would be a step forward.

2363~~~
Not really true. Even against Derby he was near the top and was involved in the Martial chance. And bulk of the criticism labelled at him is that he spends far too much time upfield (Which is a bit ridiculous in itself given he's obviously doing it under instructions). So which is it? Is he too deep or too far forward?

That's lazy criticism and doens't hold up. I could just as easily say it would help Fellaini having a competent defensive minded midfielder who can pas the ball behind him.

2364~~~
Schneiderlin's poor start has been hugely overstated imo. I actually think he's done well for us so far.

2365~~~
Didn't watch the Derby game so if it was different for that game, I'm not aware. Before that though, it's definitely a case of him being too deep as an actual CM which he isn't. 

It isn't lazy criticism. Schneiderlin has to improve his passing but defensively, he's good. I know he switched off vs Derby but in general. Fellaini does nothing to a required standard and doesn't even have the tools to do so.

2366~~~
I agree in that LVG utilized him best last season in a 4-3-3 but I wouldn't say Fellaini's individual role has changed that greatly. When he played as the LCM/LAM last season, he was counted on to do his fair share of defensive responsibilities but also get forward into the box whenever he could. Likewise, he is still tasked with the same role this season, with ample tactical freedom to get forward at will, whilst contributing defensively without really holding a position in a disciplined manner. Difference being that we had Herrera as a RCM and a DM (Carrick) behind him last season, which meant the midfield could cope with Fellaini's runs forward and not lose control. This season we only have a DM and a #10, which means the midfield is completely unbalanced when Fellaini makes his forays forward and imo, he still has been given the same freedom (perhaps to a slightly less degree) to venture forward.

Most of our midfielders haven't been playing well and that includes Fellaini too, who quite simply hasn't made the impact he made last season, despite being given ample freedom to do so. I get that the system he currently plays in means the midfield loses its structural integrity, but he should have no excuses as to his lack of threat in the opposition box as he does have the freedom to get forward. So in essence, we are compromising on the control in midfield (probably intentional given Fellaini's rather obvious attacking role) but Fellaini simply hasn't been coming up with the goods which makes it a really bad trade-off. Also Schneiderlin isn't helped by this lack of balance in midfield due to Fellaini's role, but regardless his individual performances have been largely underwhelming nonetheless. It's just quite disappointing that LVG discarded that 4-3-3 and is obstinately sticking with the 4-2-3-1, this season. Did we even try the 4-3-3 this season? Maybe we did at times, but can't quite remember.

2367~~~
Some of our players are worryingly shit. He isn't the only issue. I'd have Darmian, Lingard and Blind in the same category as well...as in players who make it impossible for us to be a strong unit, because the team has to cope with them being there rather than benefit from them in any way.

The difference is though that these players either just aren't very good or are being played in a position they shouldn't ever be playing in (Blind)...with Fellaini it's both...he's a rubbish footballer and he has no idea how to be a midfielder.

You can generally just aboout get away with one or two passengers, but having a passenger in a position they can't play in means the rest of the team is constantlly having to try and compensate...or is unable to function how it's supposed to.

I also suspect that Fellaini is in the team to compensate for the fact that Blind is too short to be a centreback and so Fellaini has to do Blind's job at defensive set pieces, which is just another layer of dumbness to add to the whole thing.

Every game we are a team trying to cope with our own team selections and shortcomings and as long as that's the case there just isn't going to be any significant improvement...and as long as Fellaini is playing in midfield it's allways going to be the case.

2368~~~
I agree with the first paragraph. Having him and Herrera playing in a midfield three allowed Carrick to easily release the ball from midfield to attack. It's an outlet we don't have these days due to playing two in midfield. At times, Fellaini seems to be torn as to whether he should push up forward or assist Schneiderlin in a deep role. I really would like to slap van Gaal and knock some sense into him with regards to our midfield. As for Fellaini, he hasn't reached the heights of last season where he played a vital role in achieving our lowly aims, and that's mainly the fault of his manager.

2369~~~
You have correctly identified the issue but still insist on him having a similar role? Why? How's it even possible? As you rightly said, with Herrera and Carrick both being there last season, he was in and around the box during our attacking plays. It just doesn't happen now because it's only schneiderlin/carrick/BFS behind him in defence and thus unless we are chasing a goal, he stays deep.

2370~~~
Again, not true. Watch the games he's played this season. He's playing the same role he did last season. If anything he's played more as #10 than a CM which is why after every game you have people coming on here and complaining about how he spends all his time too far forward.The differences have been that a)He's not been as good and b)Carrick hasn't played much and not as good last season, Herrera has been awol and two new signings have been crap. 

He's not been good defensively at all. Repeatedly let's people go off and has the highest fouls/game in the league because he has to resort to kicking people to stop them after letting them run by.

2371~~~
He plays a slightly more reserved role but he still frequently bombs forward, leaving Schneiderlin almost playing as a lone central midfielder. I don't think he stays deep or plays a disciplined role at all. Would appreciate it if perhaps someone could provide Fellaini's average position heatmaps and shed some light on this matter.

Maybe that came off wrong. I'm in no way, in favour of compromising control in midfield so that Fellaini could make an impact further up field, whilst leaving the midfield undermanned to a certain extent. Imo, LVG probably thinks our central midfield is slightly stale attacking wise and too safe, and thus wants to inject some threat by introducing Fellaini in that role. I think he's aware that we more or less lose control of midfield when he plays Fellaini in a midfield duo, or at least I hope so. Perhaps he thinks that is offset by Fellaini's contributions upfield or something, although that clearly isn't he case based on Fellaini's form this season. In an ideal world we would have someone who has the tactical nous to both balance their attacking forays forward and yet maintain defensive solidity and balance at the back (Davids for eg) but Fellaini doesn't have that and needs a more customised role. He shouldn't be played as a CM in a midfield duo.

It's just weird though, we could just play Schneiderlin as the DM and let Herrera and Fellaini take up their RCM and LCM roles in the past few games, when Schweinsteiger and Carrick were unavailable. Yet we persist with a 4-2-3-1 with Herrera being underwhelming in the #10 position and Fellaini being completely miscast in a midfield duo.

2372~~~
Hes simply not good enough, at least not as a starter, and certainly not as a traditional CM (in 2).

I do not blame him for that, its just the way it is @<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/amar__.54956/">Amar__</a> made a fantastic post on the previous page which has yet to be disproved. We are a worse team with him in for the style were trying to play. We have no control, no possession and our defence suffers due to it. 

His biggest strengths, hes not even great at it. The number of times he doesnt jump for a ball just infuriates me.

He had a purple patch last season (those four games) which the whole team played well, but other than that, his United career has been as disappointing as most thought it would be.

We need to forget about other players performances at times (theres this need to defend fellaini by saying "at least he was better than x player"). That shouldnt come into it (and X player should be judged in his own thread). As this is the fellaini thread, ok / decent is not good enough for United. For me, its not even that he looks awkward or clumsy, its just that I believe hes not what United should be to get to the next level we were once at.

2373~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> <a class="username" data-user="90058, @Joga Bonito" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90058/">@Joga Bonito</a> Would need heat maps to know whether his average position is different. I think it is compared to last season.

2374~~~
The longer this nonsense of him starting every game goes on, the longer we are going to look abject in our midfield area. It's funny, Fergie abandoned the midfield for years, two managers have come in and invested heavily in it yet you could argue it's probably in a worse state.
I don't know how we've managed to do that but then nothing surprises me about the shambles this club is becoming any more.

2375~~~
Been good so far. The whole team has really, but he's looking a bit more disciplined in central midfield. He's not launching himself around and leaving enormous gaps. He's been solid in the challenge and winning a lot of balls. I'm no fan of him but can't fault him in the first half.

2376~~~
Won quite a few aerials. More than usual.

2377~~~
My mind hasn't changed one bit about him but he hasn't as bad as I thought. He needs to stay back and stay with Carrick, he is no use bombing forward.

2378~~~
Good game from him so far, credit where it is due for sure.

2379~~~
I know I'll get shit for this and I gave him a 6/10 for the overall game, but we are so wide open in the middle of the park with no mobility in there, and I think his use of the ball is often poor when he gets in good positions, I mean credit to the fact he knows he can't make certain passes, but we need players who can make those passes and keep our forward momentum going.

2380~~~
It's a fair comment.

2381~~~
He was shite for me. The midfield was wide open and he slowed us down so many times in posession.

The idea of him being on the pitch is better than the reality of it.

2382~~~
What you've said is right about his use of the ball but he's not the only player who has been guilty of killing our tempo in recent games. It's been a common theme throughout the team, imo.

Despite popular opinion, I think he's been one of our most consistent players this season and we do seem to miss his aerial presence defensively when he doesn't play.

2383~~~
Spot on. The vacuum he left in the middle left me concerned at times.

2384~~~
He was ok today. Looks more comfortable and composed next to Carrick then he does Schneiderlin. When Schneiderlin and Fellaini play neither want to take responsibility for the ball.

Fellaini tends to pull too far wide probably becauI think it was a conscious effort from LvG to put him on the right side of Carrick to give Martial more space to work in from the left. Thinking back, it probably allowed Mata more space to operate and link up with Martial  from the centre too.

Glad he got applauded off too because this was a better performance then what we've seen from him lately.

2385~~~
He isn't and never will be good enough for us, he has to go. The fact that he plays over Herrera and Schniederlin is baffling, it's as if all he has to do for LVG to justify starting him is win a few headers.

2386~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but you must be completely blinded to him if you thought he was shite. Kept the ball moving, maybe slower than we'd Iike but recycling possession quickly is not his game, giving out about that is like giving out that Carrick didn't make enough mazy dribbles. He had 2nd most passes in the team at one point and I don't remember him misplacing many. Strange that he apparently left our midfield so open given that stoke created nothing. De Gea make a save? 

I'm on record as saying I think he should be sold, but saying he was shite today? Madness or bias, in my humble opinion.

2387~~~
Yeah, because they've both been lighting it up lately! Herrera rubbish all year and Morgan terrible lately.

2388~~~
Fellaini started and we played well. But I thought that was impossible?!? Isn't he supposed to be single handedly bringing the average ability of the squad down by a few magnitudes?

2389~~~
I don't why people hate him so much. he like any other footballers, has his attributes which in certain games, we need. I'd prefer a duo of Carrick and Schneidy but vanGaal obviously felt the aerial presence Stoke posed needed a player like him. I'm sure everyone remembers how we spectacularly capitulated in the game he was taken off.

2390~~~
They're at least capable of playing good football, I'd rather they be given a chance to play in to some form than watch Fellaini lumber around. Fellaini isn't capable of being good enough for us, the other two are.

2391~~~
I always thought he would do well against a team like Stoke.

2392~~~
He was a bit of a passenger and probably our worst player on the night but he did ok overall and was a solid six out of ten, arguably his best performance of the season which sums up how poor he has been.

2393~~~
The commentator said how many assists he's made in his 58 United matches.

Guess.

I'll give you a little hint: It's ONE (1).

2394~~~
Assists aren't important. His job to bring the ball down and knocking people out

2395~~~
That assist was a header that hit the crossbar.
His aerial threat is the biggest myth in world football. I long for the day he leaves Utd.

2396~~~
The one at Anfield a couple of weeks ago? Jeeeez.

2397~~~
Must admit I laughted when Crouch did him with his arm/elbow. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2398~~~
The very one. That was also the ONLY header he even jumped for at Anfield.

2399~~~
What a player.

2400~~~
How? Herrera has been cack all year. Schneiderlin has been poor since his return from injury.

2401~~~
He was OK, not United player in my eyes, takes him ages to release the ball at times.

2402~~~
That may be true but only because we persist on playing Blind at CB just because he's left footed. When it's just not his natural position, nor is he strong enough in the air in my opinion to play there long term in the PL.

We are basically putting two square pegs in two round holes, to the detriment of the side.

2403~~~
It's not just because he's left footed, it's also because he's a great passer of the ball, helping us keeping possession.

2404~~~
Yeah which is easier in that position if you are left footed. But none of that changes the fact Blind isn't a Centre Back.

There are other actual defenders out there who are also great at passing out from the back but also much better in the air than Blind.

2405~~~
I constantly slate him, so credit where it's due. He was decent last night, not great but he did ok. I will admit i thought an immobile midfield of him and Carrick was an accident waiting to happen, especially if Fellaini did his usual disappearing act. But he didn't let that happen. Kudos.

2406~~~
I understand your sentiments but I'm of the opinion that Blind has been great at CB; better than Jones, McNair and Rojo anyway. 

His lack of height is covered by Smalling and Fellaini and their inability to spray the ball about is covered by Blind. 

It's unorthodox but I like it. I'm also happy that LVG is persisting with the same setup, injuries permitting. We've had to chop and change so much over the past few months which can't have helped our performances and this year we've started to improve our play dramatically.

2407~~~
I've never seen a player with such limited creative ability. I don't think he's ever made a pass over 5 yards in his career.

2408~~~
I don't hate Blind at CB he's done well considering he's never played there before this season (in a back 4 anyway), but let's be honest here if Van Gaal had signed Ramos, Hummels or whoever Blind wouldn't be playing back there. So he's not in Van Gaals long term plans back there, he's a stop gap and rightly so because we are not winning the League or CL with Blind at CB. 

Similarly no team with Fellaini in a midfield 2 (good player though he is in a certain set-up) is winning much either beyond the odd cup. If Van Gaal is replaced in the summer i would put my house on the next manager not playing Blind at CB <b>and</b> Fellaini in a CM 2 on anything like a regular basis if at all. 

We would be a much stronger team with a CM who can pass better than Fellaini and a defender who can pass like Blind but is also more suited to playing CB on his own merits without having to resort to playing tall players in other positions to cover his lack of aerial presence.

2409~~~
As usual, the shocking (but so anymore) of "can't pass, no aerial threat" comments in this thread.

You know if people genuinely criticized Fellaini for his short-comings it would make sense but playing him down as this disaster just proves some of you hate them man no matter what he does or will ever do. 

To the lot that thing is absolutely terrible: You do realize such a terrible player was Everton's best player for a few seasons (and they were a top 6 team throughout). Anyway, no use arguing with them since they've made up their mind.

But to answer the normal critiques, I think he should start against Chelsea because he seems to be finding some form.

2410~~~
It's the sort of midfield that would probably struggle in a game where we're not in control and on the backfoot for a lot of it, but was more likely to work when we played attacking football.

2411~~~
I don't see what is particularly ridiculous about those criticisms. His passing, for a player playing regularly in midfield, is distinctly average. Someone like Carrick, for example, is a far, far better passer. Fellaini's passing usually involves him tentatively shifting it off to whoever's beside him because he knows he's not a good passer.

And his aerial threat is distinctly average considering his height. He consistently squanders chances when he does get them, and doesn't win anywhere near the number of aerial duels as he should for someone of his size. No one's saying he's awful in the air, but he's basically moderately okay there because of his size. He certainly doesn't offer enough of an attacking threat. Useful for defending set-pieces/corners though.

2412~~~
That vs "the worst player the PL has seen" or  "can't pass more than 5 yards" is a big difference. Besides, Carrick is a better paser because that is his strength. As for his aerial ability, he has had some bad outings this year in regards to that but in general he is very good in the air - at Everton and last season he proved that quite a lot of times. 

So yes, there is something very ridiculous about those "worst ever" 'criticisms'

2413~~~
People exaggerate. It's what happens. A lot of Fellaini fans seem to take over the top criticisms of him in an equally over the top, offended and literal manner. I'm sure no one thinks he's the worst ever player we've had, or the worst passer in footballing history.

And his aerial ability really is quite average for someone of his height. Again, he's very useful for defending corners when the ball comes in his direction and he can get rid of it. But when it comes to getting a shot on target and threatening a keeper, for instance, he's often hilariously bad, and offers little offensively in that regard for someone who's being touted as a decent attacking option.

2414~~~
I admit I don't like Fellaini in terms of I just hate watching him play football, it's not what I want to see on a pitch, especially for United. His defenders are rabid at times but the thing I wonder is do even they think he's a player who should be a regular in a United team if we are to try and get back to where we were?

2415~~~
Yeah I do. At least as part of the squad - he can do that job very well. He's a better player than the likes of Cleverly and Young who have had careers here.

2416~~~
Cleverley, yes. Young, no way.

2417~~~
Being better than Cleverley shouldn't be the barometer for deciding if a player is good enough to be in United's team though to be fair.

2418~~~
Well there was a time on here that my suggestion of him being better than Cleverley was laughed at.

Agree to disagree I suppose. If you were building a team and you could have one of the two which one would you have? I'd pick Fellaini. On his day he can be almost unstoppable.

2419~~~
But why not get a better young CM to come in and actually offer some than other than height in both boxes, he just seems to me that if we are looking to reestablish ourselves has no place in a United shirt in any role.

2420~~~
His day being the 29th of February?

2421~~~
His fecking chest control though boys, the way he brings people into play with that torso is unreal.

2422~~~
Wow. Just jumped for a header. Nice Fellaini. Any chance you might do it when in the box, particularly from a corner?

2423~~~
He should be taken off immediately for not clearing that ball in the box. Appalling. Absolutely appalling. Chelsea have come into this since realising they can just walk through our midfield.

2424~~~
He started really well, I thought, but faded away as the half progressed.

2425~~~
He's been ok but my god that 'defending' that led to the Terry shot should be a sackable offence.

2426~~~
He's been fine.

2427~~~
This. Matic has the upper hand now

2428~~~
Started out very well, was excellent. After around 20 mins he completely faded away and Chelsea are walking past him, Carrick struggling with no assistance from Fellaini

2429~~~
Another pointless performance, it's so easy to expose Fellaini, it's ridiculous!

2430~~~
He's so immobile that even Matic is outrunning him.

2431~~~
Yeah, Matic definitely came out on top. Maybe Morgan can have a go now. Kind of doubt it though. He rarely comes on as a sub.

2432~~~
Not sure what he was doing for the chance at the end. Started well though before fading away

2433~~~
So much for his super aerial ability, physicality and defensive attributes!

2434~~~
He was decent for some of the corners. He needs support to follow up on him.

2435~~~
Yep, started well.. beating players in the middle of the park, winning tackles and really dovetailing well with Carrick. Has gone quiet though. We always seem to start well and fade once we realise our attack isn't going to penetrate a rock solid defence.

2436~~~
Him constantly allowing Matic to ghost past him could be costly.

2437~~~
Overall, good game so far. Played better in the first 25 minutes or so, just like the rest of the team.

2438~~~
Been very good defensively this half

2439~~~
Our best spells under Louis have come with Fellaini in the team.

2440~~~
Much better but still a fecking dope.

2441~~~
As soon as he came off we lost our main outlet which allowed Chelsea to keep coming at us. Poor decision by LVG to take him off under the circumstances.

2442~~~
Rubbish. They were already coming at us. I was glad to see him come off.

2443~~~
Had a good game against Chelsea. Still a joke of a footballer to some.

2444~~~
He looks tired, needs a rest I think.

2445~~~
Should have scored that header. He's missed too many chances this season.

2446~~~
They may of came at us still, at least we would of had a target to aim at rather than giving the ball straight back. Bringing Morgs on lost us another point of attack, allowed them to come on us more.

2447~~~
Thought he was very meh and passive after the first 10 minutes up until half time. Second half was dominant. Looks knackered.

2448~~~
Couldn't understand why he came off when Chelsea were starting to throw everything at us and launch it into the box with Terry up front. Lost our outball too. Could've taken Mata/Lingard off and moved Fellaini forward a bit or stuck him right up top. LVG is clueless. Thought he played alright really.

2449~~~
Was he injured? If not, the decision to bring him off - when he was having his best game of the season for us - was completely bemusing.

2450~~~
He was average today, not hopeless on the ball but just ran past way too often in midfield when he doesn't have it, the sub was the right one IMO as he was looking tired and Schneiderlin was the correct replacement.

2451~~~
Not great on the ball, but his best contributions were defensive ones. He was good in the physical battles. We lost a lot of that when he went off.

2452~~~
He was good today, didn't give the ball away too much and provided much needed energy.

2453~~~
Didn't even commit a ton of fouls today, which was welcome. Still wish he'd play the ball forward more than 1/10 times and attack the crosses in the box more but until we come up with a better solution, he's decent.

2454~~~
Today he was average for me. The game just went past him after 20 mins. Spent a lot of time ball watching which really annoyed me. I was really surprised how easily he lost possession a couple of times when he held it up.

2455~~~
Good game

2456~~~
Hope he plays well for the rest of the season so we can sell him in the summer.

2457~~~
Thought he played quite well today. Not sure why LVG keeps him on all game when he's useless and subs him off when he's decent

2458~~~
So true <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

He's not my cup of tea but I think we'd have seen the game out with him on the pitch. Not much of note attacking from the big man but defensively he was a rock and we wouldn't have had to sit 10 yards deeper knowing the out ball is on.

2459~~~
He faded towards the end of first half and then in the second half, played a lot recently, should be given a rest.

2460~~~
Played well, especially in the second half. Was tidy in possession as well and controlled De Gea's passed very well on the right.

2461~~~
Love him or loathe him like me, one has to accept he is playing with each passing game. Seem to cutting out the reckless challenges and playing to impose himself in game, again.
His partnership with Carrick has looked productive so far. Him being substituted allowed Obi to push up.

2462~~~
Honestly I ripped him to shreds at times but today he looked good. I guess it's games like this where Fellaini's strengths can really be useful.

2463~~~
Why doesnt he jump? Is he afraid what happened to Zouma will happen to him?

2464~~~
As in the Southampton game, once he went out, it felt like we have no physical presence at all and Chelsea was able to get easier to our box. Granted, Chelsea started to push before he went off, but once he was substituted it felt that their control of the game became official.

The good thing about Fellaini is that he can be useful in the closing stages of a game whether we are leading or need a goal. If leading, he can help defending, especially set pieces. If we need a goal, he can be the target man. Either way, LVG sees in him a starter (at least for now) and I think rightly so.

2465~~~
Agreed

2466~~~
I am pleased to see him do well, he gets a lot of undeserved shit.

2467~~~
I thought he was poor and I can't remember the exact moment, but when Terry nearly scored because Fellaini wasn't smart enough to position himself to clear it summed him up for me.

Lacks the intelligence and can't be relied on to play in the pivot in midfield. Further forward or preferably not at all.

2468~~~
Oh, c'mon. No player in our team today was poor.

2469~~~
His vertical leap has to be 4 inches, max.  No one expects him to be a Michael Jordan but if he could at least 16 inches off the ground and fought for the ball he'd be undefendable on crosses.

2470~~~
Why are people SOO confused with Fellaini and the substitution? It is so simple. LvG thinks that of all our CMs, the least defensive one is Fellaini. If he wants to score/win a game, the CM pairing will always be Fellaini + 1. After we went 1-0 up, he took him off to defend the lead and brought on the most defensive DM we have, Schneiderlin.

2471~~~
If we were going to aimlessly pump the ball long at 1-0 we would have been better off moving Fellaini further forward and having Mata go off for Schneiderlin. Hit the balls to his chest and try to get possession that way. We had absolutely no outlet for that last 20 minutes or so.

2472~~~
He played well.

2473~~~
played well I thought. Surprised to see him taken off.

2474~~~
Should have moved him to CF instead of taking him off.

2475~~~
Not in squad today. Van Gaal said he's 'more or less injured'. Not sure what that's supposed to mean, but we could miss him today, especially as Sunderland are pretty direct. That said, Defoe up top shouldn't give us too many problems aerially.

2476~~~
Conceded on a set piece straight away.

2477~~~
He wouldn't have helped

2478~~~
Ffs.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Were you just waiting for something like that to happen?

It wasn't a particularly highly driven shot or anything, since it had bounced by the time it reached the box, but sure Fellaini would've helped with that.

2479~~~
We missed his aerial presence from that ball along the ground.

2480~~~
Settle down now, I'm not saying Fellainis afro holds the cure to cancer, just that like it or not, he is a big defensive presence for us on set pieces. 

With Blind as one of our CBS we really don't have much strength or height in the team without Fellaini.

2481~~~
We're too soft without him.

2482~~~
And again, the set piece had absolutely nothing to do with aerial ability, which is what he offers. I don't see how it's relevant.

2483~~~
Maybe that's why he's always giving free kicks away? Because that's his only use. Very clever

2484~~~
Are you following on teletext? The ball was low, he wouldn't have made an ounce of difference.

2485~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2486~~~
I am aware that it wasn't a high ball. The notion that Fellaini is just a big floating chest and afro with no legs is a bit bizarre though.

We can guess "what if" situations all day, the fact is that we took Fellaini off against Southampton and conceded a late set piece, and the next time he is out of the team (now) we concede another immediately.

2487~~~
Which is what you're doing right here.

Again, the conceded set piece has absolutely nothing to do with Fellaini's aerial ability. You could've easily gone into the Will Keane thread, or Ashley Young thread and said the same thing...because I'm not sure what Fellaini offers us on the ground from set pieces that no one else does.

I get that you like to defend Fellaini...but defending him even when he's <i>not </i>playing, by citing something that isn't related to what you're saying he's good at, is incredibly tenuous.

2488~~~
I'm not mate. To quote a great man, I am talking about fachts. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I didn't say it was an aerial ball, nor did I say that Fellaini is only useful against aerial balls. I said he is good at defending set pieces.

If we REALLY want to delve into it - which I don't particularly - then we can take about the way we were set up (expecting an aerial ball) the marking assignments (Martial on Defoe) and other factors. 

My opinion is that with Fellaini in the team we may not have conceded that goal - that's the opinion. The fact, is that we have been weak on set pieces without him lately.

2489~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2490~~~
Got it pains me to say it, but no Fellaini, two set piece goals conceded. 

FFS.

2491~~~
He wouldn't have been able to do anything about either of them, on the along the ground and the other one was smalling losing his man in area fellaini doesn't normally defend from set pieces.

We might not be a good team without him but we are even worse one with him.

2492~~~
Not just set pieces, he is a far better partner for Carrick then Schneiderlin. 

Van Gaal logic.

2493~~~
We're at least better defensively with Fellaini. We're no worse offensively.

2494~~~
He also cuts the crosses coming in and prevents them ever being put close to goal.. He's a United player who deserves more credits than he currently gets(

2495~~~
He probably would have gotten in the way of that first goal but during corners he's not on man mark duty and that ball would have gone over him.

2496~~~
Yep, have to say it. He's a much needed presence when defending set pieces.

2497~~~
No it really wouldn't as he's usually defending around the first post and, as clearances during defending corners go, he's doing damn good job at it, agree about the first one.

Not that it matters anyway really.

2498~~~
For me this speaks less about Fellaini and more about Blind/Smalling. United have never had to be reliant on a non-defensive player to survive set plays, but the 2 CBs just can't get it done. 

Mind, it wouldn't hurt if we had a big striker. RVP/RVN etc were actually reasonably handy at defending too. Drogba was a one man defensive machine.

2499~~~
What a nice, polite bunch we are without him.

The only player that can head a ball here.

2500~~~
We are worse, we get less points when he play and our best defensive record was when he wasn't playing. we lost today because we aren't very good, fellaini doesn't change that.

2501~~~
You know who is awesome at defensive corners? Zlatan.

2502~~~
We'd have won our last 2 games if he'd played 180 minutes. Fellaini solidifies us in a way that Schneiderlin should but doesn't.

2503~~~
It's not just about set pieces. Fellaini shows physical presence that no other player in our team has. He's not technically gifted, but he has attributes that separate him from others. We conceded against Soton without him and looked very weak in the midfield when he was out. Chelsea took control of the game when he was subbed and today it looked like Sunderland could easily get to our box with him out of the team. The set pieces are easy to see, but to me he is more important for the team than just defending these.

2504~~~
So we like him now?

2505~~~
Please, this game did not miss Fellaini. He would not have improved anything. How many times have we conceded from set pieces with him in the line up. The Fellaini fan boys have come out to play now that we have lost without him. We lost because the whole team played poorly today, I wonder what universe some of you live in if you think Fellaini has the magic touch carry a whole team.

2506~~~
There is no Fellaini fan boys, there is people who doesn't see him as a useless bog brush though.

2507~~~
All our best performances have had Fellaini in the side. Last season and this season.

2508~~~
Could say the same about Herrera too and most of our worst performances have been with Fellaini in the side too!

2509~~~
Look I don't think by any means the future of the club is Fellaini, but I'm sick to death of the lad getting blasted by people when there are so many other players that get away scott free. The reality is he didn't play and we were still shite, so lay off him next time. We're crap as a whole.

2510~~~
Has there been any confirmation as to why he wasn't in the squad today? His aggression seemed perfect for an away trip to Sunderland...?

2511~~~
Today will confirm his name being one of the first on the team sheet when ever hes fit.

2512~~~
He's spent best part of three seasons not being one of first names on team sheet, doubt one loss will change that, especially as our results on the whole are better without him.

2513~~~
LVG will see that we conceded two set pieces today (without fellaini). On top of conceding one against Saints when he went off, plus conceding against Chelsea after he went off.

Right or wrong, I can see LVG now making him one of the first names on the team sheet cos of his "aggression" which was lacking today.

2514~~~

2515~~~
He was missed today basically because Carrick / Schneiderlin doesn't seem to have gelled yet - both quite poor today. Fellaini would have offered much more protection to the back two/four and is another get-out option for De Gea other than rolling the ball to Blind

2516~~~
He was missed because Carrick and Schneiderlin are a pair of fecking wimps. At the very least Fellaini isn't afraid of a tackle.

He isn't the answer to our problems but give me his presence in the middle any day over those two pussyfooting around the place.

2517~~~
He's been on a good patch of form.  It was quite obvious we missed him, just like we did against Chelsea.

2518~~~
Fully agree - his substitution against Chelsea was pointless

2519~~~
We like him now as he out of the team, the moment he starts again he'd be the one of the worst players to play for us.

2520~~~
Typical

2521~~~
He's been <i>okay</i>, but I'm still struggling to see the fuss. As other posts have said, we'll no doubt be moaning about him once he's back...and the fact that other players performed poorly doesn't make him any better. He'd have perhaps been useful for defending the 2nd set piece, at a push...but it's still based purely on conjecture, because it's a set piece that he could've been in a different position for, or not gotten to anyway. And we shouldn't have to rely on a midfielder to defend set pieces against an average relegation contention side anyway.

2522~~~
Wow! How good was the midfield?! We completely bossed it. Carrick payed like it was 08/09 and Schneiderlin finally became the beast CM everyone knew he could be! Without that afro anchor dragging them down we finally played beautiful football and looked like a top side!

Oh, wait? That didn't happen? But everyone said that without Fellaini we would be a lot better? We couldn't even beat 18th placed Sunderland.

2523~~~
Your boy wouldn't have made a difference. China is calling

2524~~~
Think his positioning would have allowed Smalling to stick with his man instead of going for that first ball.  
His physical presence cannot be underrate, how well he utilized it is another discussion but the team does benefit from it in defensive set pieces. 
I know am guilty of not thinking highly of him as creative force, doesn't mean I can't appreciate the good things he does.

2525~~~
Actually, this was exactly the kind of game where Fellaini would have helped. His aggressive, physical presence was very much missing in midfield. As was his strength and positioning on set pieces. Not to mention having another target/nuisance in the box once we were chasing the game.

2526~~~
Obviously but the rhetoric that he's the one stopping the team or certain players (Schneiderlin) from playing well needs to stop.

2527~~~
Oh yeah, that's true...although I'd hope most people have realised that by now. For all Fellaini's deficiencies, it's daft to blame him for Schneiderlin's form, because Schneiderlin's problems have generally been related to the fact that he's been utterly anonymous as opposed to actively poor. And Schneiderlin being anonymous/failing to impose himself on a game has nothing to do with Fellaini. Most should get that though.

2528~~~
Oh yeah, we would've definitely won with his in the side, would've made allllll the difference.

2529~~~
In theory, Fellaini might have helped defending on the two set pieces but he's unusually poor heading the ball for a big man.  If you put the ball on his chest it's a different matter.  But he barely gets four inches off the ground and is rather poor at aerial duels.

2530~~~
I don't think we would have conceded that second goal. 

But my point mainly was that Fellaini hasn't been dragging the performances of other players down. They're just not playing well and that is not his fault.

2531~~~
Can we just try and sell him in China?

2532~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but it's impossible to not recognise that he is giving us an outlet when we're not good enough to play it out from the back. You could see that we needed someone to be able to win the ball when the defense were under pressure, but we failed to do so several times. Unless we'll get a target man / any striker able to hold up the ball better than Rooney, we kind of need someone like Fellaini in the side.

2533~~~
Is there any truth behind that video doing the rounds showing him (admittedly in a dodgy silhouette) in a London nightclub on Saturday night getting abuse from United fans?

2534~~~
Seriously mate, what does he really offer as AM? He's not particularly quick which means he cannot exploit the spaces given to outrun defenders and score, he's not particularly creative nor technically gifted. He's a relic of a style of football that thank god is vanishing at top level. A football were players shove their way into success

2535~~~
I don't see that, the outlet would be efficient if Fellaini was actually good in the air but he really isn't. The only thing he is very good at is trapping the ball with his chest but sadly for him some balls require aren't always are that height.

2536~~~
I don't know if Fellaini could make a difference or not on Goals, 
But watching Schneiderlin performance I don't know, I think Fellaini could have done better.
Don't get me wrong, but there is nothing justify Schneiderlin should be playing ahead of Fellaini.

2537~~~
I'll be cracking out a nice bottle of scotch I've been saving when this clown finally leaves the club. Yes, that's right, no objective analysis here.

2538~~~
He is quite shit but at the moment we need shithouse like him in the middle to actually head the ball and tackle people even if he can't pass water and commits more fouls than Lee Cattermole.

2539~~~
I have a bottle of Ciroq labelled 'Fellaini feck off party' just for this occasion.

2540~~~
I am one of his worst critics here but it made sod all sense to drop him against Sunderland when he finally put in a good midfield display against Chelsea, especially considering how we sort of cracked once he was taken off against the Chavs. I really don't get VG. He plays Fellaini when he is playing shite and drops him the moment he puts in a decent/good performance. Almost seems like VG is trying to act too smart for his own good or is trying to sabotage us on purpose.

2541~~~
His offensive heading does seem quite ineffectual at times, but defensively he is usually excellent when it comes to clearing corners and other set pieces.

2542~~~
Im not sure, pal. Only heard about that yesterday, but when Van Gaal said he was more or less injured I was a bit skeptical. 

Hopefully we'll get more of an insight in the next few days.

2543~~~
With just that silhouette it's going to be a difficult one to prove … geez - it could easily be his brother

Reported to have a torn Hamstring, out till March or so.

2545~~~
Beat me to it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2546~~~
His chest and head are fully functional so he can be on the pitch and no one would notice

2547~~~
A tear...so back at the end of March at the earliest and another couple weeks to find <i>match rhythm</i>.  This season just keeps getting better...

2548~~~
There is nothing a few Chinese herbs can't cure these days. He should go there quick!

Come to think of it, didn't he somehow get injured when Napoli were in for him, now the Chinese rumours kicked off a few days ago and he is injured! Pack your bags Fellaini , they will cure you!

2549~~~
So far it has been another midfield masterclass in Fellainis absence.

2550~~~
Oh feck off. He's shit and other people being shit isn't going to change it.

2551~~~
I'm guessing you'll say he's shit because his playing style is shit. Well I hope you enjoy the masterclass performance put on today.

2552~~~
He may be shit, but he's less shit that the other options we have.

2553~~~
Nah, he's just as shit as them. People just seem to like whoever isn't playing because they forget how shit they are, for whatever reason.

2554~~~
Is there any chance he will be back for Liverpool in the europa league? He does well against them

2555~~~
He's back, very happy about this. We've got our solution to their press and a good player to feck with them in setpieces.

2556~~~
TRIO CLOSER TO COMEBACK
Louis van Gaal told <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>MUTV </b></a>that Marouane Fellaini, Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia are coming back but he would prefer not to risk selecting any of the trio without them firstly playing in the reserves.

RETURNING PLAYERS NEED RHYTHM
The manager explained in his <b>MUTV</b> interview: "They are coming back, but normally they cannot play a match because the rhythm of the game is much higher. So, we have to train more and let them play in the second team. Maybe because I’m forced because of the circumstances to take a risk, like I have done with Marcos Rojo, but when I’m not forced to then I shall not do that."

2557~~~
Can you still buy Dit Da Jow over the counter, or white flower oil. Brilliant stuff that for aching muscles and bruises.

2558~~~
Like the look of Herrera and Schneiderlin. Fellaini can be a good impact sub.

2559~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2561~~~
The manager says he would prefer if the 3 got some games in the reserves first. So he is close to being back. He definitely wouldn't fling him in against WBA.

2562~~~
Has Louis gambled on him getting a set piece goal and being a man mountain defensively?

2563~~~
He'll either score or be sent off. Probably the latter.

2564~~~
looking forward to the liquid football he'll bring tonight.

2565~~~
What is this nonsense Louie?

2566~~~
At least wait for the game to start to complain about his performance.

2567~~~
I hate him so much. I don't even care if he plays well.

2568~~~
Ffs, can we leave the shitting on Fellaini after assessing his performance you judgemental cnuts.

Herrera's had a knock, he's starting. Get over it.

2569~~~
His stare on the profile pic is funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Edit: Looks like a bird from angry birds

2570~~~
You and plenty of other posters on here. 

This guy time and time again plays better than so many of the other crap players we got out there but gets shat on here for no reason. Just hate.

2571~~~
No

2572~~~
Lol, no.

2573~~~
Well thought out arguments with facts and logic!

2574~~~
Depressingly predictable nonsense.... Just the same as he's served up for the past 2 seasons.

Fellini is a beacon of turd topped with a novelty wig.

2575~~~
On what merit does he walk into the side? Any reasons? 

Baffling.

2576~~~
Because there are certain topics which don't really need any facts any more.

2577~~~
It's gone past being baffling how he gets games now, it's just plain hilarious

2578~~~
Yes, the Fellaini hate moved beyond facts or reason long, long ago.

2579~~~
He's awful so far. Offers nothing at both ends.

2580~~~
Who would've thought

2581~~~
So its just blind hate? Well done!

2582~~~
Many years from now, your children will ask you "Dad, this Fellaini fella, what was he good at?"

2583~~~
The definition of a passenger.
Spectator in centre mid.

Worst player to wear a Utd jersey.

2584~~~
I think he is the worst player to have over 70 apps for us!

I can't stand him. He is everything Manchester United never used to be, the biggest visual indicator of our fall.

2585~~~
No player epitomizes the post Fergie attitude of this club than Fellaini.

Over priced. Substandard. Lazy. Characterless. Slow. Weak. Uninspiring.

He encapsulates everything that's wrong about the club since Fergie left.

Why is he still here?

2586~~~
This should be printed in neon letters and made to scroll over this thread.

2587~~~
Good at chesting though.

2588~~~
Woeful.

2589~~~
Lots of people were getting called out for saying Fellaini is a waste of space, he playes well against Liverpool at Anfield they said <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How has United become such a small club that there is no desire when playing even against Liverpool.

At this rate, United will be the team which has a couple of big moments in 10 odd years and then comes back below radar, exactly like how Liverpool have been for the past 20 odd years.

2590~~~
What do you think will happen after being served shit after shit on the field for almost 3 years?

2591~~~
Yep.

3 fecking years of this shit, of having to watch him amble around the pitch giving away stupid fouls and miscontrolling the simplest of passes. He's the avatar, the symbol of our decline.

2592~~~
He's not played well but his role is so odd. Him and Schneiderlin are never anywhere near each other. Your two centre midfielders should be a real pair.

2593~~~
Hoof ball. Every time we get a free kick the opposition just knows where its going. You could see all the players move towards him.
Best to use him as a decoy if LVG insists on playing him.

2594~~~
No one knows his role!

2595~~~
His existence blocks the path for someone like Pareira to play. Its almost as similar as when we had Cleverly and Anderson playing instead of Pogba.

2596~~~
Think he's been playing quite well

2597~~~
He's bossing the middle of the pitch on his own in that second half.

2598~~~
Having him and Schneiderlin as a midfield two with no playmaker was never going to work. With Carricks presence behind him/them, the system is much more balanced.

2599~~~
Think he's doing well.

2600~~~
He's done well second half.

2601~~~
He's the one trying to get the team started by inserting some spirit into the play.

2602~~~
About time he got his ass into the box

2603~~~
Easy punching bag. Unfortunately for him, he's symbolic of the Moyes era so everyone will crap on him.

2604~~~
Looks like he's the scapegoat for tonight anyway.

2605~~~
Been awful but other than de gea who hasn't had a bad game.

2606~~~
Not our worst player tbh.

2607~~~
i dont know why people are making excuses for him. He's so far out of his depth for where we aspire to be, he was godawful tonight and seems to compound any problem that he's meant to fix.

2608~~~
He's not good enough, but at least he actually looked like he could be arsed in the 2nd half. If the same could have been said for the rest of them then maybe we wouldn't have got humped so badly.

2609~~~
Love the contrast of comments on the last page

2610~~~
Our best outfield player today, mainly due to the fact he showed fight.

2611~~~
I'm not good enough, but I'd have burst a ball tonight. Doesn't mean I should get 90 mins against Liverpool at Anfield!

2612~~~
He's also shit. Can't attack, can't defend and should have been sent of like usual. 
What he symbolizes is a shite record because United have a poor win record with him on the pitch.

2613~~~
Did he sleep with the ref's sister and not call her back or something?

2614~~~
By all means, if you got yourself fit enough I'd have been happier seeing you run around for 90 minutes tonight than the shite we got.

2615~~~
He actually was. He showed some nice footwork that opened play up. Go to scapegoat.

2616~~~
He is a complete and utter fecking idiot. Please leave the club and don't come back.

2617~~~
fecking idiot.

2618~~~
Sign him on a 10 year contract!

2619~~~
Nolan with funny hair

2620~~~
Our most creative player in this game.

2621~~~
Dirty elbow on Can at the end. Should never have been left on for 90 minutes and it makes a mockery of Van Gaal's match rhythm bollox.

2622~~~
Please keep telling me how he is useful to this side. I really am intrigued by such analysis.

2623~~~
getting himself banned to save us in the second leg. what a player.

2624~~~
His snide elbow at the death sums up that useless, lanky excuse for a footballer. 

I've said it before, he's some face paint and a unicycle away from being an actual clown.

2625~~~
Shit, how people are thinking he was our most creative player is beyond me

2626~~~
He was actually fairly decent for the first 30 minutes of the second half, arguably our best for that period. Shit for the first half though, and then that rubbish right at the end was utterly stupid.

2627~~~
Many things you can blame him for but for that? Come on.

2628~~~
An absolute fecking mess of a player.

Whoever the new manager is in the Summer, first thing he needs to do is ship Fellaini out as soon as possible. Before he's got his name on the office door he wants to be putting Fellaini on the transfer list.

2629~~~
Didn't see the elbow, is he getting a ban?

2630~~~
If it wasn't seen by the referee and won't be in the post-match report he probably is, yes.

2631~~~
If the ref had seen it would have been a straight red. I blame LVG for leaving him on for the whole game.

2632~~~
By "fairly decent" you mean he made a few passes, for a small while in the game... a base-level expectation of a Sunday league footballer.

Shows how the expectations have fallen. 
Just think about Roy Keane Vs Juventus... Fellaini - along with most of the players tonight - were a lacadasical disgrace to the club, the jersey and the supporters.

2633~~~
how he didn't get send off tonight is beyond me - he's a complete liability and no where good enough to play for us. Why is he still here?

2634~~~
This we can agree on, punching/elbowing people like Can or Henderson should be awarded with a bonus though.

2635~~~
Probably our best outfield player IMO. Not that that means he was good. Probably lucky not to be sent off though considering how strict the referee was.

2636~~~
He is a fecking awful footballer but he was probably our 3rd best player tonight, that's how shit we are.

2637~~~
Come on guys, remember he had as solid 3 game run last season. That enough warrants a place in the starting XI, especially when you consider he has the most premier league experience in the squad tonight bar Carrick. Another 3 years and he will come good!

2638~~~
He did more than just making a few passes. He was making good runs, winning challenges, and overall playing a big part in the only good period we had during the entire match.

2639~~~
Fantastic today, chest control and headers won were incredible. If we build our team around the quality he showed in that first 20 minutes of the second half, things will only get better.

I know he gave away about 6 fouls tackling players half an hour after the ball had left them but at least he was tenacious in it.

Unlucky to be booked.

2640~~~
Are we talking about Zidane here?

2641~~~
He had a short, mediocre spell in a 2-0 loss.

2642~~~
I don't care how effective he is (which is still debatable), he's not a United player and encourages shit football. I can't wait till him and Van Gaal are fecked out of this club.

2643~~~
In all honesty, he wasnt too bad today as well. Put in some fight, kept it simple, started some attacks. Not good enough though.

2644~~~
Honestly he wasn't bad, but I just hate that he plays for us. I know it sounds wrong, but we should be aiming for higher quality.

2645~~~
In all honesty he could barely play a simple pass. He couldn't control a ball for shit. He was lazy, dirty an lacking any quality or ideas. If he is every seen playing for us again it's the 2nd biggest disgrace in the history of football. Behind Van Gaal still being in charge.

2646~~~
I thought a couple of his forward passes were decent at times. He found gaps and released people into space between our midfield and defence now and then in the second half. He throws himself into challenges too heavily though. There's being competitive and then there's what he does. He's not Manchester United standard but I guess most of you have been saying that for a while.

I'm surprised he wasn't in our penalty area more often towards the end of the game. He had a decent chance from a header and it's the only time I can remember him being in the box to win something in the air.

2647~~~
He and Rooney must be the only players that Van Gaal brings back from injury that don't require 'match rhythm' and play the full 90. Is it cos he doesn't have any rhythm in the first place

2648~~~
Perhaps. He's certainly got guilty feet. The crime being to have the first touch of a newborn foal that's run across a landmine.

2649~~~
Something tells me Moyes included a clause in their contracts. They are undroppable!

2650~~~
Played alright on his return but should have been sent off

2651~~~
It is no coincidence that pretty much everytime he plays in central midfield we get overrun.

I don't hate the guy but if we keep playing him we will never be a top side. He's just not good enough, no title winning side will ever have a Fellaini in it.

Mind boggling that we had Herrera, Carrick and Schweinsteiger on the bench and play Fellaini.

2652~~~
He only looked decent cos we played shit football tactics which suit him. We play our best stuff when hes not in the team.

I dont hate him but he should not be starting for us, especially after coming off a layoff like he did. And he finished 90 minutes. Hes meant to be a plan C (at best) for when we need a late goal. Not somebody we start in midfield for games like this. So frustrating.

2653~~~
The best thing he did was elbow Can to effectively take himself out of the return leg. 

Don't hate him but his presence on the pitch reminds me of the state we are currently in, and that aggravates me.

2654~~~
Klopp actually said they coped with the long balls to Fellaini very well. Beyond depressing when they say it in interview

2655~~~
its funny how LVG picks and chooses which unfit players can and cannot play only 60 minutes, due to lack of match rhythm

2656~~~
Is it though? I mean, Carrick looks done (even moreso after this game), Schweinsteiger has been back for one training session and was never going to play, and Herrera is not that overly good himself. Liverpool have a clear weakness at set-pieces and they like to press. It really isn't that strange that he started. Perhaps he should have replaced Mata in a more advanced role and then have Herrera or Carrick behind him.

2657~~~
It is yes seeing as how he isn't really a central midfielder and the other 3 are. Fellaini was only coming back from an injury as well so the Schweinsteiger explanation holds no water really. 

I can't remember one instance in tonights game where Fellaini caused them any troubles at set pieces can you?

And anyway even if he did, is this how far we've fallen we that play now big men because they might cause the opposition a bit of trouble on corners and freekicks. Jesus.

2658~~~
He'd trained more than Schweinsteiger though. Anyway like I said, it probably would have been wiser to play him as the AM instead of Mata rather than CM. So I agree with you in that regard.

We had no corners and one of our very few freekicks was hit to the corner flag by Depay, so no we didn't threaten them. Well the set-piece ting is part of the reason. The other is that he is an effective way to beat the press.

2659~~~
I mean i can see what your thinking is mate because we can launch it long to him. But let's be honest they pressed us into our own box for almost the entire first half. What was the possession stats at Half Time do you know?

In tight games like this i would much rather have someone in CM who is better with the ball at their feet. Because pretty much everytime he plays in there we get overrun in midfield like tonight.

And yeah i definitely agree if he had to be on the pitch i would have preferred him to have played higher up in front of two actual central midfielders.

2660~~~

2661~~~
I rarely get to watch games live but I always check the result now before I watch the replay (I used to always try and not hear results and watch games blind but with the state of our results I've not really bothered of late). I always come in and have a bit of a peek at what people are saying about certain players.

This thread always confuses me greatly. It is always filled with various absolutes about the lack of Fellaini's ability, can't dribble, can't tackle, can't even lace his boots in the dressing room. Then I watch the replay of a game and I just see a genuinely average (or decent, like his second half today) performance filled with maybe a couple of bad touches or bad passes like every other player who ever plays football. I just wonder why people get so emotional about a player and I have to come to the conclusion that he's an emotional punching bag for some. A player who, no matter how good a game he's had will always take the abuse of the fans with his chest out, come back for more and always give 100% for the shirt.

I've never really been fond of him as a player and it was only last season that after the real adversities he faced in his career he still continued to puff his chest out and give 100% for the shirt no matter what. He won a lot of respect with me and even when he stepped in to protect Januzaj.

I'll never be able to fathom why people really do their lid about him. He's you're run of the mill squad player who puts in run of the mill performances which everyone completely leathers him about. What a waste of breath. At least he is one of the few who have looked like they give a shit this season regardless of what is going on. I like that about him, if only that. People need to calm down a bit I think.

He was quite clearly not match fit and I have no idea why he started/played 90 mind you. That was a bit bizarre, I can only come to the conclusion that Van Gaal values his drive and then likes to push him forward late. Which is weird for such an advocate of quality football (haha yeah right) all across the park. It just seems so out of the ball park really.

2662~~~
He's crap. His fighting spirit doesn't change that unfortunately. Also you don't spend and give a salary to a 30m rated player whose just a run of the mill squad player

2663~~~
I really dont understand some people' s definition of decent. He made one good clever forward pass the whole game. He lost a header challenge from the welsh andrea pirlo. He miscontrolled it 4-5 times. He couldn 't stop effectively anybody so he was just giving fouls everywhere. He could have been red carded on 78 minute, one minute after the great LVG decided not to change him. Our decline this year began since he was introduced on the 55 minute against PSV, in a game that we seemed to control and created a few chances, after we couldn t go past the middle of the park. Since that game we resemble a team fighting for relegation, with fellaini featuring to most of the losses.

2664~~~
Meh, he <i>is </i>crap that is not in question, but his positive attitude counts for something. I'd rather eleven players who gave at least a solitary shit rather than ten that don't and one that does. I care neither here no there about what he's worth, he at least has a dig regardless of the size of the cheque he's owed.

2665~~~
Shit but not as shit as others. Story of his time at United and speaks volumes for our squad as a whole.

2666~~~
I'd give him 4/10 but 3 are for punching/elbowing Emre Can.

2667~~~
Not saying a lot but I thought he might have been our best outfield Player yesterday.

2668~~~
That's the thing, attitude alone doesn't get you anywhere these days. Actually its counterproducive because that player would probably end up losing it after being ridiculed one too often. Don't take me wrong I love players with attitude. God know how much time I spent in here defending Gattuso (that was until he put Scholes in his pocket, after that there was no need to defend him anymore). However it must also be backed with something call it characteristics or talent that justify his role (in Gattuso's case was stamina, decent positioning and superb man marking). Fellaini doesn't have anything of that. He's too slow and lack positioning to play as DM, he lacks vision and passing skills to play as playmaker and he's hardly a goalscoring threat upfront. He's a relic of a style of football which thank god is becoming extinct


I also think that most of our players do care. Some are too old, others are not good enough while others are not yet ready for first team football.The problem is LVG. His tactics seems confusing even for us who are watching the game let alone to players. I mean Rashford on the flanks. FFS the boy has yet to come to terms playing first team football and the manager decides to switch his role and back him with another youth (as RB)? Id love to know what LVG is smoking.

2669~~~
What is this positive attitude and fighting spirit people are talking about? Is this the same guys that jogs around the pitch, that is 10 yards from the opponent he should be marking, that can't be bothered to direct a header? Just because a player likes to fling his frame, it doesn't mean he has a fighting spirit. If the ball isn't within a 2 yard radius, the guy refuses to move. Throwing elbows is never an indication of a fighting spirit. It is thuggery. Too many excuses for a guy that can't play Football. Should never ever play for United again, worst player in recent years.

2670~~~

2671~~~
He does work hard, unfortunately he lacks positioning and speed which means he is rarely in the thick of the action.

2672~~~
I want to agree with you but works hard at what exactly? This is the thing that baffles me. He is like watching a spider killing a prey, won't move until the prey is within reach. Heck, the spider at least is successful.

2673~~~
that's cause he's painfully slow

2674~~~
So if he is slow, why does he then run box to box, with the action happening 30 yards ahead of him, whereas he could just stay in one position and be there. A lot of people slating Schneiderlin but it's not easy when your CM partner leaves you alone to do a 2 man job.

2675~~~
that's because he lacks positioning and he's very very slow. Carrick was slow but he seem to know where the action will be and he will make sure he'll be there. Gattuso was like the duracell bunny, he will be everywhere, every time. Fellaini lack both skills. He would be a nuisance to the player whose near him but that rarely happens cause he can be easily outpaced or ignored

2676~~~
But but but but, he made a couple of defensive headers.

10/10.

2677~~~
He's symbolic of shit, shit, shit and utter shit.

Basicly, his best interaction yesterday was elbowing Can in the face, so that hopefully he'll miss the match at old trafford.

2678~~~
Good post, mirrors what I have thought and argued for what feels like years on here.

2679~~~
The first half was a horrible performance, he didnt get anywhere near their midfield. 

2nd half he was actually quite composed on the ball and made a few nice passes. He was our only player actually fighting like they wanted to win, but unfortunately he goes too far and ends up getting into trouble. I knew with the reputation of that ref he would be walking a thin line.

2680~~~
Its a constant source of frustration to me that we have the biggest player on the pitch but we don't use his strengths.  

Unsupringly from LVG, defensively Feliani is used correctly,  front post from corners/freekicks and he clears them all day long.

From open play he was fine controling the long ball into midfield, despite what Klopp said he won most those balls easily,  we did nothing with it afterwards. 

What annoyed me was his never being in the penalty box, seemingly instructed to hold shape and hang on the edge of the area, I counted only once when he was in position for a cross.

The other annoyance is for 3 years now from every set piece he's at the back post. He should be at the front post in the eyeline of every opposition player. Not every ball needs to be aimed at him but his presence alone will cause at least one or two defensive cockups a game

2681~~~
He got beaten to a header by Joe Allen... His "aerial threat" is the biggest myth in football.

2682~~~
Nonsense

2683~~~
Just because he is tall doesn't mean he will 100% of headers. But 9/10 he would beat Allen for the ball in the air. Lovren is good in the air and he beat him for the ball and almost scored.

But but but phillip lahm out-headed him too so hur dur hur his aerial threat is a myth.

2684~~~
Definitely not nonsense. Tiny Joe Allen beat him to a header.

2685~~~
Almost. Thus being of zero threat.

2686~~~
He's also front post for every defensive corner, stop playing daft

2687~~~
How many goals / assisted does he have?

If you think he's good enough for Utd, then there's no point arguing.

For me, he's not good enough to be a professional footballer let alone a Utd player.

2688~~~
When he plays he's rarely the worst player in the team. In fact he's usually very involved when he plays. He's also an asset defensively on set-pieces. But when he plays our performances IMO are worse, this hoofing towards him at all times, I can't recall it ever working this season. 

It also seems to me that he plays mostly next to Mata leaving the other midfielder with the whole holding responsibility of the midfield. Our midfield becomes vulnerable and more often than not overrun. 
He is also a brute and there seems to be a sending off incident every time he plays.
He's more often than not our plan B, so he very rarely gets taken off when we need improvement. For me that speaks off tactical failure for LVG. 

We play better without him, we have more room for improvement without him and we have several better players in his position. He should be permanently dropped and sold in the summer.

2689~~~
In terms of percentages Fellaini is fairly average among midfielders, he wins 48% of his aerial duels, that's less than someone like Lucas Leiva.

2690~~~
The point I'm trying to make is we don't use what strengths he has properly. If we had a player that was quick or strong we'd want to use it against slower or weaker players. We should be taking advantage of his dominace in the air.

I wouldn't want him in the first team but I don't mind him being in the squad, there will be games over the course of a season where we can use him.

2691~~~
While true i don't think that alone should justify his place in the side, and i know you are not suggesting that either. To be honest while he is good defensively on corners and free kicks we could have signed a number pf players who could have provided that for us who would have cost significatnly less than Fellaini did.

This is the depressing thing about Fellaini, quite often when he's played at CM we get overran and are more often than not losing or drawing a game because of it. 

Yet he's kept on because the thinking seems to be he has the potential to hurt teams on set pieces. And yet how many games/points have we actually rescued from a losing position because of Fellaini's ''aerial threat''? Very few i would wager.

It's madness and poor management from LVG. And yes i agree as much as i actually don't mind the guy it's time we moved him on, as he's holding us back.

2692~~~
I am dismayed every time I see his name on the teamsheet he is utter shite, Cant pass, cant tackle (without trying to kill someone) has the pace of a wounded
sloth , his heading is poor I cant see any advantage to playing him at all . Oh shit I forgot he can chest a ball , how silly of me to forget the attribute that allows him to play for United .

2693~~~
As harsh as it sounds, I honestly thing he's the third worst thing to happen to United since SAF left after LVG and Moyes.

2694~~~
I thought it was a fluke when he was outjumped by Coquelin TWICE against Arsenal last season. Joe Allen this season, would it be Lennon next?

I to I'm of the opinion that he's heading ability is a myth. Heading the ball is is not just jumping high to allow the ball hit your head, when in an offensive or defensive position, which is what Fellaini does most of the time. He heads the ball to no one, and has himself or team mates chase the ball. I don't know how many people have a good recollection of this, Van Persie in Fergie's last season, this guy was a beast at defensive headers from corners. It was amazing that was not talked about. Not only was he scoring the goals, he was as effective when defending in the box, saving us many many times. This season, I look at Wjinaldum's attacking heading at Newcastle and realise what a fraud Fellaini is at heading.

The two primary assets for heading is the reach and the ability to control the direction and power of the contact. For Fellaini he naturally has one, you would think he would have less to worry about when he comes to training headers, just focus on direction and power. BUt clearly he doesn't have the technical ability for his fabled, most talked about skill. The guy has no ability whatsoever, in any area of football.

Myth busted!

2695~~~
Whether he is one or worst players on the pitch or not, we rarely win when he plays and selling him will be a step forward.

He has to play as the third man in midfield to be anything other than a liability, because he lacks so many of the key skills to play there. Playing him and mata together in midfield is something manager should never do again.

2696~~~
He a tall, lanky reminder of how average we currently are every time he steps out on the field.

2697~~~
This. Of the 48% of aerial duals he wins, I would say 75% of those skim aimlessly off his Afro in any or no given direction.

"Myth busted" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2698~~~
In his 3yrs at Utd, he has demonstrated very very clearly that he's good enough in just 1 role. Funnily, LVG employed him in this role last season and with very good results. 

So obviously, the logical thing to do now is have him play a role in CM where he is so obviously clueless that it's funny at times. 

Fellaini isn't good enough for us but I swear, seeing him at CM, Martial at RW, Rashford at RW etc is indicative of how poorly thought of some of LVG's decision are.

2699~~~
I can't even remember a match this season where we haven't lined up with at least 3-5 players playing out of position. It really is ridiculous, piss poor squad management.

Even against Liverpool by my count we had at least 4 players playing out of position.

2700~~~
Rashford scored 4 in 2 and we had Martial coming back so what did big balls LVG do? Throw one of them out at RW where they look utterly clueless.

2701~~~
Yeah between those two Lingard and when he was playing Mata out there. He seems to be hoping someone within the squad will magically transform into a top right winger.

Instead of actually buying a proper right winger in one of the two last windows. Never mind a proper centre back or some fullback cover.

2702~~~
Except thats not what happened is it?

Rashford kept his position up top against Watford and had by any definition a bit of a stinker, he then moved out to the right, where he absolutely murdered their left back for about 10-15 minutes in the only spell of the game where we looked half decent. Since then, for a variety of reasons, wherever he's played he's struggled to get into games.

Lets not over-state what we've got with Rashford, he's a good prospect no doubt, and took his goals very well but he's shown no evidence whatsoever of a hold up game, has an erratic first touch, and his best attribute is his dribbling. It's in no way that weird to see him at Right Wing at the minute where he can isolate and run at players, and he certainly has not looked 'utterly clueless' there, apart from times when the expectations on him were ridiculously unfair, such as after Mata got sent off or when he was asked to play right wing back against Liverpool for god knows what reasons.

The exact same sort of stuff was said about Martial at LW the first few times he got moved there, now most would argue thats his best position.

2703~~~
What didn't happen? Did he not play Martial on the right first where he sucked to no one's surprise and then moved him upfront and rashford out right where he was poor? It isn't like Martial's situation at all, martial played on the left quite a bit before coming here.

2704~~~
Well what your describing.

Rashford's getting moved to the right was entirely common sense and he's playing there because he showed against Watford that when the teams not playing like a bunch of idiots he can be effective there.

As for Martial, what would you have done? With hindsight the answer is obviously 'drop Memphis' but you can't select a team in hindsight and Memphis was coming off the back of probably his best two games in a United shirt, not only does it send out a pretty poor message about meritocracy, but it does nothing for his confidence either. So that then leaves you the choice of dropping Lingard or Rashford. People would have been absolutely spitting blood if Lingard had started with Martial on the bench and if Rashford had been dropped, so there you go. 

I really don't think there's been much, if anything to complain about with LVG's handling of our strikers in recent weeks, with the exception of not taking of Rashford when Mata got sent off. The biggest problems been we've barely gotten them the damn ball. We could have had Messi/Suarez/Neymar up top and they'd have done nothing given how slowly, and infrequently we've gotten the ball to our front 4.

2705~~~
Memphis should have moved to the right, rashford central, martial left.

2706~~~
So your solution to shoehorning in players is to shoehorn Memphis in to a position that he's never played for us and who's entire game is based on cutting inside on to his right foot?

Anyway, this is the Fellaini thread, so this is definitely the wrong place.

2707~~~
I concur. His ability to win the ball in challenges where his opponent and he are going for the ball with their heads is vastly overstated. In fact he's quite crap at it considering his only advantage against any one is his height.

2708~~~
Ward-Prowse won two headers off Crouch today, one other one a foul on Ward-Prowse. Stop acting like this is some sort of footballing crime to lose headers.

2709~~~
He would be competing against a lot more difficult opponents in those duels (e.g. Zouma, Terry, Wanyama etc) compared to a lot of other CMs. Also, Lucas is actually quite a good header of the ball for a CM, But anyway, I think Fellaini's heading and ability to win aerial duels isn't as good as it could be (that percentage should be higher) but the way people here isolate three or four instances and use them as their argument is wrong. He is - at the very least - a decent aerial threat. We are much better defending opposition set-pieces with him there.

2710~~~
I agree. For all the talk about his height being put to use, he seems to lose at least 60% of all aerial duels with players much shorter than him coz they know when to jump and he only knows to jump.
Maybe many tall players have similar %, but at least his height being a constant threat is not true.

2711~~~
It doesn't make any sense, the other players play against the same players.

2712~~~
What Croch does, or doesn't do is of no concern of mine, because he does (or doesn't) do it in a Utd jersey.

Fellaini's sole attribute is his height, which he under-utilises at an alarming rate.

2713~~~
Fellaini is a symbol of this period in my eyes.

2714~~~
spot on.  the fact that he's our central midfield / long ball target after having two decades of Robson / Cantona / Ince / Scholes / Keane is really beginning to show the difference in class we have now than what we did.  And that's not the managers fault, nor Fellaini's, but the board.

His performance today just shows it.  No speed / stupid yellow card / we had WH on the break and i'm sure it took around 7 seconds before Herrera / Rashford and Martial had supporting players come up whilst WH sprinted back to get 7 players.  This was us, on a break.

2715~~~
Saw this on Twitter:

Fellaini 1st half v West Ham: Zero tackles, interceptions, blocks and clearances. Possession lost 11 times, more than any other #MUFC player.

Can't wait for LVG to claim he was one of the best player's on the pitch again.

2716~~~
Just one more year left on his contract after this season I believe. Can't wait til he leaves the club.

2717~~~

2718~~~
Hate him. Hope they ban him for life for his action at Anfield.

2719~~~
Get Schweinsteiger on for him now.

2720~~~
We'll probably sign him for three more years on 150k/week

2721~~~
God what a pathetic excuse for professional footballer.

2722~~~
For the love of hairy cocks, get him off the pitch, he's fecking useless.

2723~~~
Fellaini represents the problem at this club!

2724~~~
How the feck is that useless twat still on the pitch, he's just jogging inbetween doing the grand sum of feck all.

2725~~~
i don't like the guy as a player for our club.  not the quality we should have playing for us.  but for god sake don't boo / sarcastically clap him off.  just stay silent if you don't like him

2726~~~
I'm sure he had a defensive header somewhere that a certain person in here reckons makes his 75 mins on the pitch absolutely crucial.

2727~~~
Boos were uncalled for and harsh. Thought he was decent, but not the quality we need.

2728~~~
but he works hard, he cares...

2729~~~
aaaaargh, why Fellaini? Please leave our club!

2730~~~
Think that just about summed him up today. He looked hopeless. Dodgy challenges with his flailing elbows, misplaced passes, and all the usual stuff we've come to expect whenever we starts. Hopefully Schweinsteiger's cameo means Fellaini will be dropped, but I expect it'll be Carrick who's sacrificed out of the two because LVG insists upon playing Fellaini despite the completely obvious, glaring fact that he looks out of his depth.

2731~~~
How the feck was he decent ? He did feck all apart from misplace passes and jogging inbetween the action

2732~~~
That picture of him at the top just makes me weep!

2733~~~
He'll still get picked by LvG every time he's fit. 2 more months of him until José bins him.

2734~~~
I thought that he was decent for about 5mns.

2735~~~
They were in the pre-season friendly against Valencia (?) But now? Fans are fed up, they're fed up with him, they're fed up with the idiot that keeps picking him, they're fed up with our results. 

He might be getting scapegoated, but he's no where near the standard required, an absolute cnut, and symptomatic of how far we've fallen. I'm inclined to think its fair game.

2736~~~
Can we just stop this? What was decent about that? Please stop!

2737~~~
What did Moyes think when signing him?

2738~~~
Walking off the pitch at HT and sub?

2739~~~
Probably Herrera. Carrick will get hooked for Schneiderlin. 

Fellaini is a decent player but he's never a Man Utd player. Some of his passing was abysmal today. At times its easier to pass him than 'Go' in Monopoly.

2740~~~
Jogging around without doing nothing of note, most he run was when going off, can't stand seeing him in United shirt.

2741~~~
While we're at let's boo Lingard/Memphis/Rojo/Blind/Darmian and so on, they are not the standard required either.

2742~~~
Crazy that he thinks his best position is defensive midfield. Needs 500 touches to control the ball, and then turns around and passed it backwards. Cannot for his life spot a forward pass. Misses the simplest passes. Can't tackle. Cannot head the ball. Elbows players like a moron. 

Besides chesting, Chester is not able to do anything properly. Ridiculous player.

2743~~~
Maybe he wasn't "decent" per say, but I don't think he should be getting booed. He's unfairly made the scapegoat for our woes.

2744~~~
I'm convinced he won't play for united again...not after that reception when he was taken off. Even LVG isn't that stupid........well....perhaps not.

2745~~~
Gave the ball away without any pressure, due to which West Ham attacked, Blind gave away the foul and West Ham scored. Fellaini should just quit. Worst united player to play for United in the last decade.

2746~~~
As much as I think this guy should have never been allowed to take on the pitch in a United shirt, he hasn't been that awful these past few games. The reaction from the crowd was a bit unfair.

As always though, could have been sent off in the first half. How he keeps getting away with it  is beyond me.

2747~~~
He had a shocker today no other way to describe it, there is no need to boo but fans are entitled to express themselves and I think part of reason for the boos and cheers were because it had taken so long to sub him. He should have been off at half time.

Only reason he stayed on today wa because of his height, how pathetic a team are we that we sacrifice a midfielder just to play a big player, it's a joke.

2748~~~
Thought he was decent enough in the first half just like he was okish in the 2nd half on Thursday

2749~~~
This club will remain shite as long as he's here. A symbol of our shitness.

2750~~~
He was ok by his standards. But even so. The day he gets sold will be a happy day for me. He's so fecking bad on the ball that I just hate seeing him on the pitch for us.

2751~~~
Can anyone post Fellaini's leaving the pitch?

2752~~~
I felt bad for him getting cheered off. He's absolutely shit though.

2753~~~
Didn't even annoy me today. It's just comical at this point

2754~~~
Why are we starting him

2755~~~
Be tough for him alright... I guess he'll just have to suck it up, hop in his Ferrari & drive to his multi million pound Cheshire mansion and count his savings to get over it.

He deserves it all, he is brutal.

2756~~~
I don't think it's right that he got that reaction when he was subbed out. Two men are to blamed for this season, and that's the guy in the dugout with his notes and the man in the executive seat who won't sack him. Direct your abuse at them.

Van Gaal will see this as a way make himself appear like a genius. When Fellaini has the inevitable good game after a few average performances, he'd talked up his genius in continuing to play Fellaini.

2757~~~
Been booed is not a nice feeling but we need to stop being sentimental about things like this. Most of us are happy to vent our frustration at a gardener on minimum wage who messes up our lawn or a terrible performance at the theartre after you have paid a hefty ticket fee BUT when it comes to overpaid footballers, it is insane to vent your frustrations? How else is are they going to know of the fans displeasure? It's not like they are on RedCafe of we have their mobile numbers. Fans are tired and sick of this nonsense and some give up more important things in life to be served rubbish week in, week out by spoilt players.

2758~~~
Can someone explain how he just randomly started what, in the context of our league season, were probably the two most important games of  the rest of our season? I mean, serious, the feck is going on?

2759~~~
At his lumbering worst today, if he's really a CM then he's not one that is of the standard required at United, he's a symbol of this past 3 years of sub-standard crap that some seem to defend as acceptable, it's not.

2760~~~
He clearly has the same undroppable status as Rooney. He was never a United level player and never will be. If Mourinho is coming I can't see Fellaini staying or getting any meaningful playing time. He is the exact opposite of what Mourinho wants in a midfielder.

2761~~~
when it comes to CM he's not the standard required at at least 15 premier league teams, probably more! The game changed when he came off. He's fecking shite, brings nothing to the team absolutely zero input.

2762~~~
Van Gaal gets clapped as he's leaving the pitch yet we jeer one of our own players. He's absolutely shite but it's the Dutch fraud picking him constantly.

2763~~~
He needs to go. Every minute he gets is detrimental to the team.

2764~~~
I'm done with him. Today was his 79th appearence for the club. Only a handful have been memorable. In fact only three stand out (Spurs, Liverpool, City). The other times he just drifts through the motion. An absolutely nothing player. Can't pass well for more than ten yards. Always so slow in reacting that he forces himself to get into scraps. His awareness and intelligence is non-existent. His aerial prowess is fine in the defensive phase. He never does anything signficant when we have set plays though. A Manchester United midfielder selected for defending set pieces!? He rarely scores. It's just 70 minutes or more of mediocrity. What does he bring to the table? He does have games like Stoke at home where he does nothing bad and you think he had a good game. In reality the barometer is so low with him a game of basic play is a good one. I expect nothing and he delivers nothing. Pointless footballer.

2765~~~
He's not a proper midfielder. He's an AM disrupter that you launch into the box. Poor signing really and shouldn't be playing as a DM.

2766~~~
horrible

2767~~~
Inevitable? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2768~~~
LVG: "I think Fellaini played, again, a good match. That (the reaction to his sub) was disappointing. That was the only moment."

2769~~~
feck me we are in trouble

2770~~~
He just does not belong to the culture of a properly functioning United side, he slows the whole thing down and offers a lazy option for players to hoof diagonals at him, he is also an indisciplined dirty cnut, he does not pick himself, yet another head scratcher aimed at LVG, he is playing youths but only when forced to, if we were setup to attack in a proper manner we would be seeing Herrera more advanced more regularly, and if he truly trusted in a youth policy playing to our standards you would see more of Pereira and Rothwell.

2771~~~
Well seeing as Moyes began our plummet to mid-table mediocrity he probably thought Fellaini would fit right in.

That and Moyes didn't have a clue in general.

2772~~~
Well LVG has absolutely buried him with that quote, probably the last thing Fellaini wanted or needed. 

He's going to stubbornly pick him all season, and Fellaini's going to get worse and worse abuse as an outlet for anger with LVG.

2773~~~
I agree with this, but he has been no worse than most of our midfielders this season. Certainly no worse than Carrick nor Herrera before Schweinsteiger came on today.

I realise he is probably not the quality of player who should be in a top level squad, nor should he be a starting midfielder in a good United side, however he is the ultimate scapegoat for this team, whereas, in reality, he is not the problem.

2774~~~
Main issue is, whenever he plays we are forced to build our team around him. It's like picking that shit guy in 5 aside who's a liability because nobody else did.

2775~~~
This following on from the comments about what he is doing is working confirm that we should forget the P45 and just hand him a straight jacket.

2776~~~
Stopped clocks are right twice a day.

2777~~~
Because it is unusual for a manager to defend his player? 

Don't know what you guys expect, but there is no way a manager is going to slate his own player. Especially not someone like Fellaini, who hasn't got a lobby at the club/fans. The way the press continues to single out Fellainis performances and how LVG judges him after the game appear to me, that they want these kind of quotes, just to wind the fans even more up. Seems working.

2778~~~
neither does the manager. Booing/jeering him going off is embarrassing. After the chants at Anfield this week we are looking proper twats at the moment

2779~~~
Boo the manager, not Fellaini. He is what he is. I didn't want him on the pitch either, but he's not selecting himself. It doesn't send a good message to the other players either.

2780~~~
I didn't know it was "put your foot in your mouth" week.

First, Fellaini puts in a poor average against Pool, LvG comes out to defend him, Fellaini has the guts to tell us that the team failed the game plan AND to remind us that the next 2 games are important. Way to go Captain Marvel.

Fellaini puts in another shambolic performance and LvG comes out to defend that performance. What next, Fellaini comes out to tell us that we need to play attractive and effective football?

2781~~~
He's criticized plenty of our players before, just more selective bullshit from him.

2782~~~
Don't boo him, it's just horrible to hear, the guy isn't picking himself.

Reckon he'll be the first put the door in the summer, but he's done what he can for us in his time here.

2783~~~
Really worrying how van Gaal uses him as some sort of get out of jail card. It's almost like when Stoke were first in the Premier League with all their cumbersome lumps just hoofing the ball up to the big man.

2784~~~
He's a thug. Can't wait to see him out of the shirt it's a disgrace he's got to put one on in the first place.

2785~~~
Selective bullshit? Sorry, but he criticized some players who have got a lobby, who don't get slated after every game by the own fans. And no, I'm not a Fellaini or LVG fan. But some suggestions on here are ridiculous. I read an article some time ago and it said, that LVG normally reacts contrary to the media. After a good performance, he criticizes certain things and after a loss, he normally singles out the positives (in his eyes). Also, how the question was asked is also an important aspect. If the question already implies, that Fellaini played a shit game, you give the manager really just one way to go.

2786~~~
Got a lobby? What we on the Caf or in Old Trafford think is irrelevant, that is painfully obvious by the fact that LvG is still here. The managers words matter to players and he has spared no one but Rooney when it has suited him. He was asked a question that he could have easily answered "It wasn't Maroune's best game but it was uncalled for to boo him" instead of trotting out a complete lie.

2787~~~
Its no surprise this season we play better without him than with him. Im pretty sure we average more points without him than with him. (kinda a reverse Morgan)

I dont even know how LVG can say he had a good game. His stats certainly dont back it up. In fact, if he was having a good game, why would LVG take him which then saw us score.

He absolutely cannot start against Liverpool. A plan C when we need to lump the ball into the box with 5 minutes to go, sure, do it. But hes not what a United player should be. That maybe harsh, but I wont be convinced he is. Id rather see Cleverley start ahead of him and hes not even our player anymore.

2788~~~
fecking Moyes, out of all the Everton players he gets him.  Thing is, I can see him playing under Mourinho too.

2789~~~
We shouldn't be seeing reactions like that too a lad who is trying his best. Remember he was a very effective AM/CF for Everton and regularly scored 10-15 goals a season. It's hardly his fault he is being asked to play some kind of hybrid Gattuso/Pirlo role combined when he has never been that kind of player. Would it have been Vidic's fault if SAF had stuck him on the left wing and he hadn't been great?

2790~~~
Nah, I think he only reached double digits in the Premier League once, 11 goals. In an Everton team that only had one game plan, that suited his game perfectly, crosses. 
At United he has to be more involved in the short passing, running into space, and that's where he just doesn't cut it.

He's mostly playing as an advanced midfielder when he plays. So it isn't anywhere near a left wing Vidic scenario.
He's just nowhere near the required quality, and people get frustrated because of it. Not his fault, harsh on him but he just doesn't appeal to the majority of our supporters.

2791~~~
Except he hasn't because their goal came from him strolling back and not picking up Lanzini.

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> I think it was around 66:30 odd if you'd be so kind.

2792~~~
Stats from today's game according to the BBC:
<i>
"In the first half Fellaini made no tackles, interceptions, blocks or clearances. He also lost possession 11 times, more than any of his team-mates"</i> 

Yet he'll probably still start the game on Thursday.

2793~~~
I hate seeing him in the line-up, but felt a bit sorry for him after the crowd reaction to his sub.

The crowd should have concentrated on booing Van Gaal as he's the one fecking everything up.

2794~~~
He needs to play as an AM or not at sl really. His passing is too limited to play as a CM and he has a rubbish shot. 

Add to the fact his game is pass it wide and run into the box it leaves us really exposed in midfield. He also can tackle without atleast elbowing somebody at sometime. 

I do feel he tries hard and and always gives his best, but he's just not a top level player. Unfortunately the rest of our team is so fragile he's being played purely to defend free kicks and corners, which is pretty crazy.

2795~~~
What match is this?

2796~~~
this it?

2797~~~
Today really should be the last time he plays for us. He's just not good enough.

Don't like the fans booing our own players, but Van Gaal needed to be made aware the fans don't want him in the side and theres no other way really to get that across. If LVG has any sense he'll leave him out of the side now until the end of the season and let the next manager make a decision on him.

2798~~~
Anyone else pissed that we try to find him in the box with those crosses without pace? He is absolutely useless header of the ball, average at best, he gets praise for it just because he's tall, really a nonsense and everytime he plays our game struggles. Not good enough, hopefully the next manager will sell him with Rooney back to Everton

2799~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Standard fare for the Fellaini thread.

2800~~~
Another good game??

When was the first one?!

2801~~~
We really need to stop hanging up to comments like this, living in the past to make excuses, especially for players. We can't keep on talking about how he did xyz in an Everton team that were never a serious threat to the top 4 in the league. It's really embarrassing. It's almost like saying we sign Adebayor or Santa Cruz and talk about how they were banging in goals fro them donkey years ago when they should never be in the club. We are not Everton and do not aspire to replicate what Everton do. It's almost like we are too interested in Everton's tactics than the player involved. It's become an all too common excuse for Fellaini, whereas fans are reluctant to use the same excuse for Mata, having won player of the year, Twice, in a row, in a very strong Chelsea team that gave us trouble! What Fellaini did for Everton almost 4 years ago is meaningless to us now, he wasn't even as influential as Baines or Tim Cahill.

As for positions, he thinks he's a DM, Wilmots thinks he's a CM, Moyes thinks he's an AM, LvG thinks he can do a job at CF. This beyond any reason should tell us how confusing, how confused the player must be or just how bad he is that he cannot hold down a role having been a professional for almost 10 years. 10 YEARS!!! It's not about shoehorning him into a line  up, he should not be in the squad. LvG is just too silly and stubborn to realize that he can't draw blood out of this stone. 

It's the manager's fault for constantly playing him. Who wouldn't want to play in front of the OT faithful and receive a fat pay check at the end of it. But surely as a professional, you have a responsibility to improve yourself given the circumstances and resources available to you. I have watched Fellaini since he has been in the PL for almost 10 years, what aspect has anyone noticed dramatically improve in the last 10 years? I would really like to know. All my life, it has been Fellaini can chest and head, for 10 years? Find me another player in the same circumstances that has not added another string to their bow, maybe not the perfect string but another recognizable string regardless. If the guy does not recognize that he needed to add to his repertoire in that, then I really question his mentality to be a better player than  just being a battering ram or to know his most effective position. This is the main reason I can't stand the guy, not just that LvG picks him all the time.

2802~~~
Booing him today was a disgrace I thought. We are better than that!!

2803~~~
what are you expecting him to be exactly? He was stitched up being brought here by the man who knew him best, who even then couldn't agree what his best position was. Blame the powers that put him on the pitch. He might be poor most of the time but he is doing whats asked and is being professional about it. then he gets booed because he looks quirky, by a spoilt mob

2804~~~
clearly not. Expect songs about dead people on Thursday aswell

2805~~~
Vs Liverpool of course.

2806~~~
No player should be booed but he shouldn't be anywhere near the team (hence the reason for the boos) Frankly, it's Moyes' fault for signing him and LVG's fault for persisting with him.

2807~~~
We shouldnt be booing anyone but we are so bad in midfield when he plays and it makes others look worse. Herrera gets isolated as he has noone to play off and Schneiderlin gets left covering two positions on his own. He's a player to bring on in a limited set of specific circumstances but at ~27m thats not enough.

2808~~~
I'm preparing to celebrate for when he gets sold.

2809~~~
He's the only player i've seen booed since Fergie left.

2810~~~
I hate what he offers, and how we play when he's in the side, but he wasn't close to the worst player on the pitch these last 2 games, and thats the bigger problem

2811~~~
it won't be that easy. His salary probably reflects the fee we paid. No one is going to pay the new Nolan like a 30m rated player

2812~~~
Selecting him in centre mid was a disgrace.... Booing him was reflex. 

He's terrible, the manager is terrible. Does neither of them an harm hearing the masses opinion. The sooner Utd fans get of this morally redundant high horse and stop accepting mediocrity, the sooner things should hopefully change.

Trust me, there were worse things sang in the Stretford End yesterday than the booing of Fellaini.

Another disgrace is that he'll start again on Thursday as yet another firm two fingers to the fans from the senile Dutch one. When that happens, I truly hope they both get booed again.

2813~~~
Hopefully a chinese club will be clueless enough to buy him. I find watching Utd very difficult to watch with him lumbering pointlessly on the field.

2814~~~
I agree. However that's not the point I am making. Fellaini was involved in a 30m panic buy deal. His salary will most probably reflect it. No one will be ready to give him that ridiculous salary so either we loan him up and pay half his salary or we're stuck with him until the end of his contract.

2815~~~
Correct me if I am wrong but they don't seem to be keen to give ridiculous salaries to someone whose technique is similar to their average players.

2816~~~
Once again I read the mass hysterical abuse and then watch the replay and see just a normal run of the mill decent performance. Still not getting the whole "lets hurl abuse at him and boo him off the park because, funny" shtick. Speaking of the boo's, we have some utter troglodytes in the crowd embarrassing themselves with that shite.

Imagine getting jeered off the field for again, AFTER it's happened before and you've got on with your lot and turned in the odd decent performance as well. Receiving purely nothing but vitriol from the fans and still giving it a good crack.

I mean, for all the people saying "the most un-Manchester United player" he screams a hell of a lot of professionalism and giving a graft for the shirt which has been probably the most Manchester United thing in the last 20 years.. Still scratching my head over the whole situation it is utterly bizarre really.

2817~~~
Give me £100k a week, I would also 'scream a hell of a lot of professionalism and give a graft for the shirt'.

Means feck all when you're a useless donkey.

2818~~~
Are you kidding me? Reflex? Do you even know what reflex means? The one that worse than terrible is the fans who booing their own players and the ones who still agree with him deserved to be booed is also disgrace. Schneiderlin, Carrick, and Herrera haven't been good at all this season and Fellaini became the scapegoat. Fans think Fellaini isn't United quality yes he's not but so does Schneiderlin and Herrera hasn't show any sign to be United quality and to be fair just like Fellaini the three of them were overpaid as well. if you look at the likes of Carrick, Scholes, Robson, Ince, Keane. Even Hargreaves, Butt and Fletcher. And now we have Schneiderlin, Herrera and Fellaini but Fellaini is the only scapegoat? With Fellaini and without Fellaini we are still playing bad, with Fellaini last season we played much better than this season.

2819~~~
I don't think any player who dons the shirt should be booed off or abused by the fans during a game. I held the same view when Nani (a favorite of mine) was booed hen he was subbed and I still hold the same opinion when Fellaini (someone I want to see the club get rid of) was subbed. Think the players are under immense pressure as it is for the fans to add to it during a crunch match at a critical time.

2820~~~
Didn't he take a pay cut to join us? I remember rumors floating around that he gave up part of his agreed salary to get the move through.

2821~~~
I don't think he cut his salary, just the sign on payment. But I can't confirm that as truth.

2822~~~
He's a plan B or C that always seems to wrongly make its way into plan A.

2823~~~
Really? I don't remember that.

2824~~~
There's no denying that philosophy isn't working. These days even the yes men at MUTV says that. However its pretty maddening that Fellaini wasn't able to make any clearances, tackles or blocks for the simple reason that these are the only things he can produce for us. He's not a play maker and we're definitely not going to use him as no 10. FFS we're not Wimbledon

2825~~~
There's nothing wrong in paying decent money for a 'grafter'. Gattuso for example was frighteningly effective in his day. The problem with Fellaini is that he's not very good in that role either. He simply lack the pace, the defensive discipline and the stamina to play that role

2826~~~
Jeez they booed him and not killed his dog. Fans have every right to vent their frustrations. We're a football club and not the Soviet union.

2827~~~
I kinda felt sorry for him yesterday when everyone cheered his substitution.

The guy's trying, but for some reason whenever he plays we insist on using him as a target man for high balls. He was worth much more than just that at Everton.

It's quite surreal at times. When he's not in the team, De Gea tends to kick it short to a defender near the edge of the box, and we build from there. As soon as Fellaini's in the team, almost every De Gea goal kick is long in Fellaini's general direction. I don't think he's a great player, but the fact that we seem to build our game plan around him makes it even worse.

2828~~~
Hopefully Mourinho comes in and does the decent thing. Just put us both out of our misery.

2829~~~
Unfortunately he's a very one dimensional type of player.

2830~~~
The "have every right to boo" stuff is a red herring. Nobody argues they don't have the right but equally that doesn't mean it is right.

He tried his best and got booed by a few thousand people. It's crappy behaviour.

2831~~~
Its highly ironic considering that the most successful countries in football has a long history of keeping players and managers on their toes. The last three times Italy won the WC it came just after a big scandal and the media and fans wanted to rip players into pieces. That pressure didn't hindered the players one bit. 


What had England achieved at national level by going easy towards their constantly underachieving players?

2832~~~
He's just not what we need.  United deserve better and I'm sure we can find another 6 foot plus giant that can move around the pitch quicker and smarter.

2833~~~
So you shouldn't complain then because I also have the right thing to called people like you and the others as a disgraceful fans because I am frustrated to see fans are booing their own player.
Being frustrated just because the system isn't right and the result is poor doesn't mean the fans is right to scapegoat a single player by booing him. It's not his fault that the club bought and played him anyway. Didn't we play good when Fellaini played last season? Didn't we still get a poor results and play poor when Fellaini both playing and not playing this season? So why scapegoating a single player when most of our players played as bad as him this season?

2834~~~
I believe that one of our biggest problems is the fact that we simply refuse to let players go. Take Valencia. He's been shit on the flanks for years and what do we do? Sell him? No we play him as RB hoping he does well there. Same as Young and Jones/the crock twins (he's injury prone but we insist on him because who knows maybe he will one day get fit again). Its one thing trying to get the last ounce of juice from exceptional players by moving them into a less demanding role (Scholes/Giggs/Rijkaard etc) and its another doing it for any player. 

Fellaini was a costly mistake. He was a player who was brought in a team which cant play to his strengths. Just sell him and get over it.

2835~~~
First of all I don't boo players. I sit on my comfortable coach, drinking wine while watching the game. Considering how shit we are, I confess that sometimes I just dooze off or else spent a minute or two posting on redcafe. You can't blame me since there's nothing really exciting to see anymore. Therefore I feel highly uncomfortable criticizing the fans since they bothered going to OT and spend their cash to watch this crap and while I do find some of their actions controversial (the standing ovation given to Moyes for example), I would never call them disgraceful.

What I do find disgraceful is this 'taking the moral high ground' thing especially since you have no right to judge other fans. Considering that most successful nations in football find booing acceptable then maybe its about time for the English fans to get off their high horse and start demanding a bit more from their underachieving and highly paid players. Who knows maybe by keeping their players on their toes they might as well see England lift the world cup again in their lifetime

2836~~~
What does that mean? I don't think elbowing people screams professionalism at me.

2837~~~
The point is you agree with fans scapegoating and booing players. What? you think it can make everything back to what it used to be again by booing their own player? Booing players isn't the right thing and what make it worse is it's not just Fellaini is the one who played poor this season. And clearly it's a disgrace to act in such a behavior like that to a single player who tried his best. It's not his fault that we bought and playing him.

2838~~~
Is any of that true? I'm pretty sure the England team gets plenty of stick but their failings are down to ability not crowd reaction. Equally I don't think there's any correlation between success and fans having a go at the players. The only time it might work is if there's a lack of effort but that's not the case with Fellaini.

Having a go at Fellaini isn't going to increase his speed or make him pass better. As I said before nobody argues the fans haven't got the right. Having the right though doesn't mean it's ok to do it.

2839~~~
He definitely won't be seen like that. Playing and starting for Man Utd will guarantee him a decent/good salary.

2840~~~
I believe that fans have a right to express their feelings and if they feel that a player has been underachieving then they have every right to express themselves. After all they are the ones who are paying their salaries. I also believe that keeping players on their toes is beneficial. If Manchester United find that disgraceful then they should consider play their games in close doors. However I doubt they will ever do that.

2841~~~
England may not have produced a lot of great players but they had been constantly underachieving for decades now. Take last WC as an example. They had enough talent to be able to qualify from the WC groups. I wonder how  players would react knowing that a spineless world cup performance would means spending months being booed at home. That does act as an incentive for the Italian players who literally dread returning home after doing badly in an international tournament

Also just because a player is a thug that doesn't mean he is hardworking. Rino Gattuso would have never played a half without making 1 single tackle or clearance

2842~~~
Booing a player is extreme measures but I think in the case of Fellaini it's understandable. Fans see his name on the team sheet and you just know how the game will play out. Unprotected midfield, too many long balls and a slow unimaginative build up. The fans can see it, they're probably desperate for the ones in charge to see it too.

2843~~~
So what if people were booing him? Should they clap his, yet another, spinless performance in United shirt. My father used to tell me when I was playing that there will be days when you just can't do nothing right, ball will bounce, you'll misplace even the simplest of passes etc, but when that happens at least run your socks off and show some fighting spirit. Fellaini was having day off (again) and was just strolling around in easy mode doing nothing, but hey let's condemn people for venting their frustrations.

2844~~~
So the fans have the right thing to express their feelings by acting in a poor behavior to a single player who is clearly not his fault for the cause of our poor result and playing style this season?

2845~~~
Not his fault? Have you seen him play? FFS he's a defensive minded player and he couldn't be bothered to make one single tackle or clearance in an entire half. If he played at Madrid this guy would need to be escorted out of the pitch. Oh wait, a player like Fellaini would probably never play for Real Madrid. They do have standards

And i think that they should be booing the entire squad but there again I don't feel I am in a position to criticize the fans who bother going to OT rather then lazying on the couch as I do

2846~~~
I really do hope we sell him this window, will be one scapegoat less really.

2847~~~
I agree mate, it's not that he couldn't be bothered to tackle/intercept etc. He's not and never has been a center mid. His only use is a target man and we don't play him there so on that basis I hope the jeers were aimed at our management for finally noticing playing him CM was stifling us.

2848~~~
Did we play poor last season when Fellaini played? Oh wait no we played good when he played last season.
When Fellaini is playing or not did we still get the different result and different playing style this season? Oh wait no still the same poor result and poor playing style.
So why only scapegoating a single player when it's clearly not just his fault that we played poor? I could understand if fans express their frustration to the board and manager or all players but scapegoating a single player??

2849~~~
I think we haven't been playing good football for a long long time. Fellaini is just another nail to a strategy which saw quality players being replaced with shite.

I also believe that the fans knows that Fellaini isn't the only bad player in this team. However you can't blame them for booing at one of our weakest players especially since his characteristics are against everything United stand for (quality, talent and a certain conduct of play).

2850~~~
If he supposedly has a good game due to the game plan then it has to be said that game plan is shite, he's is shite and our football is shite. Sack Fellaini sell LVG

2851~~~
I'd rather have Cleverley in the team over him, he's that bad.

2852~~~
Very sad situation for him. Moyes major signing in his first summer. Very few wanted him and many said he wasn't a man utd player from the start. He is a symbol of how shite we are at the moment. It's made worse because he's the center piece of our play when he's on the pitch. Everything is played towards him, looking for a knock down. He's a signpost of what we've become. 
An obvious scapegoat.

2853~~~
Also he is absolutely atrocious with the ball at his feet.

2854~~~
Huh. I don't know what games did you watch, but people can't denied that it was a good football that we played last season in 4141 formation with Carrick, Fellaini and Herrera in midfield even the pundit acknowledged that. Weakest? Stoke City and Arsenal are our best games this season and Fellaini was playing in one of them and played very well. To me you are scapegoating a single player when there are more players also did as bad as Fellaini this season and it clearly is wrong!! And it's not his or players fault that we bought and played Fellaini anyway.

2855~~~
Did we? I have been a gradual decline in our team performance since we last won the 3rd CL. Our performances then nosedived as soon as SAF retired. Its becoming more and more difficult to watch Manchester United without doozing off and I confess that I tend to suffer from insomnia

Also note that when fans boo players they wish not to see them on the pitch again. That mean that they are criticizing not just the player but also the manager that selected him.

2856~~~
It's true that last season we played our best football with Fellaini in the side. This year it's been the reverse.

Our worst form directly coincided with him getting a run of five consecutive starts in December, we drew at home to West Ham and then lost four in a row against Wolfsburg, Bournemouth, Norwich and Stoke. Those results saw us out of the CL and ended any chance of having a good season in the league. He was shambolic in those games.

Conversely our best results and performances came last month when he was injured and Van Gaal was forced into playing our most mobile midfielders.

2857~~~
Unbelievable

2858~~~
Really strange why LVG is playing him, when most of us see he doesn't fit our style of play. Should be sold...

2859~~~
Most our games with Fellaini played or no this season were as worse as the ones you mentioned.

2860~~~
What does Van Gaal see in him? Or what hold does Fellaini have over Van Gaal? 

It's absolutely bizarre that it seems when he's fit, he plays, despite being consistently and depressingly awful. Every other player needs to get "match rhythm" back after an injury - which means a month on the bench, usually - but he gets straight back into the team for our two most important games of the season! What the feck is going on? 

The persistence with Rooney was understandable to an extent: he's the captain, he's been a cornerstone of the team for years, he's been a brilliant player in his day and a very good one throughout his career here. But Fellaini has no reputation, no past glory to fall back on, no seniority, nothing. I genuinely don't get it.

2861~~~
What is unbelievable according to you?

2862~~~
He is. I think he has severely regressed there, because I once rated his technical ability and thought he was often very underrated in that respect. His first touch and control used to be very solid. These days he seems to need to take 5 touches to control the ball, the he stops dead before picking a rubbish pass. He just kills everything.

I can't fault his effort, nor how he's up for any physical battle with any opponent, but he's just not good enough, and we look better without him.

2863~~~
I can see what you're trying to say mate. But what else are they supposed to do?

What would be the point of him being in the side and the rest of the team not trying to play to his strengths?

He can't pass for shit, has no first touch to speak of, has little positional discipline, isn't fast and can't really tackle without fouling. So without his heading and chesting which the rest of the team are trying to utilize what else would he bring to the side.

He doesn't even really warrant a place in the side as it is, but if we aren't even going to at least try to use him as some sort of target man then it would be farcical for him to be in the starting line-up.

2864~~~
No they weren't, look at the facts I posted. Our worst form of the season came with Fellaini's longest run in the team, our best form of the season came when he was injured. If you want to praise Fellaini last season because he played well in our best games that helped us reach top 4 then that's fine, I agree with you. But it's dishonest not to acknowledge that this season it's been the reverse.

2865~~~
you do love players with no talent don't you?

2866~~~
That's a good point. There's not really any other way to deploy him in the starting 11. His game revolves around heading and chesting, which seems to be at odds with our keep-it-low and keep possession style of play.

Have to agree, he doesn't warrant a place in the starting 11. You could maybe argue that he should play as an impact sub when we're desperate for a goal, but even that tends not to work as our go-long efforts bear no fruit.

2867~~~
And thats our problem with Fellaini in a nutshell really mate. We are caught between two stools with him, we don't fully build the side around him like Everton to get the best out of him and the way we currently set-up he disrupts our passing game and kills attacks.

At a side like West-Brom etc. he would be a great asset. They could play him further forward and direct all their play towards him like Everton used to and he would be very effective. But no side that does that is ever winning titles or even coming in the top 4 as he's just not that good a player to warrant a club like United building a team around him.

2868~~~
Since I've seen it a couple of times in this thread, I'll repeat again that Fellaini is not a scapegoat. It's a lazy accusation to make at his detractors which masks his failings.

A scapegoat is someone who is criticised at the expense of other players. But that's not happening with Fellaini, is it? When he was playing alongside Schneiderlin, the vast majority of posters agreed that Schneiderlin was <i>also </i>playing poorly, and irrespective of Fellaini being beside him, he had to up his game.

Then you've got Carrick yesterday. Again, if Fellaini were being used as a scapegoat, we'd have been defending Carrick, saying he's still got a lot to offer, and needs to be beside a better midfielder. But, once again, that's not the case. Carrick has received plenty of criticism - because he hasn't been very good, and is beginning to look a bit past it, as much of a shame as it might be.

Then you've got players like Rooney, who has been slated for most of the season. Or Darmian, who has come under heavy criticism. Lingard is regularly labelled as being average and ineffective by a considerable number of posters. Blind's lack of defensive ability, even if he's done a reasonable job for us in defence, has been heavily criticised recently. I've seen plenty of negative comments about Rojo. Then you've got Depay, who was coming in for heavy criticism until recently. <i>And</i>, most of all, you've got the manager...the one receiving the most criticism of all.

Again, if Fellaini <i>were </i>a scapegoat, then this wouldn't be happening. You'd see posters trying to excuse other players, especially in midfield, at the expense of Fellaini. You'd see people saying the manager doesn't have enough to work with. Or that Fellaini destroys our whole game. We don't, though. Because people don't use Fellaini as a scapegoat. They just think he's shit.

2869~~~
Has he had a single good game this season?

2870~~~
So uefa not taking any retrospective action against Fellaini, they really want us to lose.

2871~~~
He offers nothing. He is tall but not very good in the air. He is slow. He can't pass, he can't beat a man, he doesn't score much, he doesn't assist much, he can't tackle. All he does is "run" around and foul people.

2872~~~
I instinctively thought - "good news".

Won't do any better than the alternatives and far more likely to see you end with 10 men.

2873~~~
LVG constantly praising him is baffling. He really is saying anything to save his own skin.

2874~~~
He wasn't great. Booing your own player is disgraceful.

When he's gone they'll find the next scapegoat just like Nani etc to pick on.

2875~~~
Of course we did. Fellaini had some good matches in some big games tbh but he still had many average/shit performances too with the team playing badly in general.

2876~~~
Only LVG can come to England and embrace the most archaic and worst thing about english football - The launching it to the big man tactic.

2877~~~
Eh?! Just... what?! Please, explain what reflex is, your grasp of language is clearly stronger than mine. I agree, he isn't the only weak link in the team, but he's stand out terrible. 
As for being better with Fellaini as of 16th Jan this season;

Since he's come back from injury, we've lost 2-0 and scraped a draw. 

I wonder how many Caf members would 'try their best'... but their lack of ability might warrant booing too. Trying your best isn't good enough, this is Man Utd we're talking about, you have to be better than everyone. He laboured around that pitch like a headless chicken yesterday, late to every move we put together. Ambling back into defence way behind play & supporting the strikers long after the moment had gone. 
Booing his substitution, for me, was as much remonstrating his languid, lethargic, futile 'performance' as it was the delusional Dutch fool for picking him. It's difficult to show disdain for LVG other than venting through his 'managerial' decisions.

This. 
He's painful to watch & it's clear that 90% of Utd fans have had enough... problem is - aside from a Europa citation for his elbow - defiant LVG will pick him on Thursday, guaranteed. He'll play 90mins, guaranteed. He'll get his name in another referee's book, guaranteed.

2878~~~
The England team does get slaughtered, Rooney complained about boos as he was walking off the pitch. The media are merciless with them. If anything that kind of pressure has made them worse, they look scared and timid. This England analogy just doesn't work, if anything it proves the opposite of what you want.

Fellaini got booed because he's rubbish not because he was lazy. There is no possible way somebody shouting boo will make him a better player come the next game.

2879~~~
That's your opinion. Others are of the opinion that it's disgraceful that Fellaini is a Man Utd player, let alone LVG's favourite ineffective gameplan. Some might think that LVG still being in a job after his horrendous run of results since December is disgraceful. That the Utd board are more interested in lining the Glazers pockets with earnings from Japanese Tractor partnerships than addressing the issues on the field, could be seen as disgraceful. 

Fans pay enough to voice their opinion, positive or negative. Being served up sub-standard performances week-in week-out grinds down even the optimistic among us. If we could see light at the end of this tunnel of footballing sewage, we might be more tolerant, unfortunately for the tall one, he literally stands out like a sore thumb in a wig. 

Of the chants I heard yesterday in the Stretford End, booing Fellaini was one of the least 'disgraceful' things.

2880~~~
The with and without stat makes painful viewing.

Why is he getting played. It's so bizarre.

2881~~~
Fellaini can't even head the ball.

2882~~~
I assure you players in the EPL have no idea what real pressure is. Its not me who is saying that but the likes of Vialli, Di Canio, Gazza and Ravanelli who played in both leagues and had highlighted the difference in both leagues

Also when someone boos a player he's not only booing the player himself but the manager's decision in choosing him. Basically they are saying 'get that piece of shit out of the pitch and do not allow him to return'

2883~~~
Yeah its worked a treat for Italian football. All that European success their clubs have had over the last 15 years.

You seem to be hankering for a very nasty atmosphere.

2884~~~
The serie a had been rocked by a series of scandals and financial problems who are totally unrelated to the supporters. Despite that + the fact they have the weakest national team ever they still manage to dominate England with their hurrykanes, captain chelseas and white peles in every opportunity. Players know that they have to deliver quick or leave.

2885~~~
Using England's struggles to prove it's productive to boo Fellaini.

Sorry just can't get my head around this one.

2886~~~
I am not saying that though isn't it? I am only questioning whether its wise to treat players like some sort of vulnerable people who are one step away from suffering a meltdown especially since those countries who don't treat players like that, tend to be more successful in football than those who do. Proving the fans wrong is a great motivator. Italy won 3 of their last world cups prior to a scandal which rocked football only to falter when they were absolute favourites of winning the god damn thing. A player who was considered too old to even play for Italy went on winning the world cup and the ballon d'or.

2887~~~
Im pretty sure that all of these things have been said in this thread numerous times, and thats just in the last couple of pages.

Honestly the outright delusion of a lot of fans when it comes to Fellaini has gone past the "ludicrous" stage and is now genuinely worrying. I have given up trying to defend him<i> not </i>because I think he is playing particularly badly, but because trying to get people on here to change their opinion on Fellaini is probably something akin to Aristotle trying to persuade folk that the world was round and not flat.

This thread has just become a cesspool of hate, and with most of those defending Fellaini (such as myself) having decided to stop wasting their digital breath, it just means that week-on-week, the rewriting of history, the ridiculous revisionism and outright lies just grow more and more blatant, with nobody really bothering to point out that actually, a lot of you are just talking plain old shit. Case in point <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2015-16-performances.406879/page-70#post-18926243">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2015-16-performances.406879/page-70#post-18926243</a> - I particularly liked this one because <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> produced actual visual evidence that the other poster was talking shit, but of course it just got brushed under the carpet along with those other unnecessary nuisances in the Fellaini thread such as facts and logic.)

2888~~~
I don't think anybody's saying we should treat Fellaini like a vulnerable person, strawman argument.

You're saying the deciding factor in Italy doing better than England is pressure from the fans. So therefore we should apply more pressure to Fellaini.

I've explained why in my opinion that makes no sense.

2889~~~
No, they haven't. Seeing one or two posters doing it is not akin to a majority. The vast majority of posters accept that the likes of Schneiderlin and Carrick just haven't been good enough this season. We've got so many players who have been criticised this season, so the argument that Fellaini is somehow a scapegoat, is utter nonsense.

And again, it's not hatred. If people truly <i>hated</i> him, then they wouldn't be criticising our fans for booing him off yesterday after another turgid display. The vast majority (myself included) agree that it was silly for our fans to boo him, and I don't have anything against him personally because he seems like a decent enough person. He's just not good enough to play for us, regularly produces woeful performances in midfield, and no level of supposed scapegoating or unfounded hatred is going to change that.

For the aforementioned clip from GifLord, you're using it as one particular incident where someone got something wrong with Fellaini, and using it to argue that somehow everyone was brushing it under the carpet. It's utter nonsense.

2890~~~
I was questioning the strategy of cuddling the players/managers too much by refusing to boo at them when they are doing shite. As said before Fellaini may be the symbol of this crappy United but our problems run deeper than simply replacing the useless giant.

2891~~~
Yesterday, in his most recent "woeful" performance, he was no worse than plenty of others; Blind, Rojo, Varela, Herrera, Carrick, Lingard, Rashford, Memphis.

2892~~~
Herrera, Varela and Rashford had decent enough games. But, anyway, I'm not talking about them...I'm talking about Fellaini. Why the need to throw other players under the bus in order to defend Fellaini playing poorly?

2893~~~
Not been in here for a while, is his elbow being looked at by the fa?

2894~~~
Its not a case of throwing anyone under the bus (although now that you mention it, that is certainly a theme in this thread). I will say it bluntly then: he wasnt anything like as bad as is being made out, which is pretty much the norm.

2895~~~
Indeed, just like Rooney was one a problem among many others. As long as there isn't a fundamental change in terms of football, replacing players won't change much in terms of results.

2896~~~
Feel like at this point he's essentially wasted 3 years of his own career. Sure, he's playing for a big club like United, but I feel he could be much more appreciated somewhere else in the Prem. 

He simply doesn't belong here, and that was evident before Moyes even signed him.

2897~~~
We've got two problems

a- lack of quality in the first team
b- a philosophy that simply does not work

we might be able to compensate for the former by sorting the second problem (SAF did the miracle in his last season). However there's only one SAF.

2898~~~
Id rather booing is applied to the manager rather than the player. If the player is naff, hes naff. But its the manager who picks him

2899~~~
Define doing what he is asked, which is professional? Losing possession like no man's business, outrightly playing crap? Isn't this the same argument people used for Rooney. You want to know a player that just does what is asked of him? Jon Obi Mikel. Despite what people think of him, he is very effective at what is asked of him. There is a reason why he has lasted that long and been favoured by most managers at Chelsea.

2900~~~
its not the same argument for Rooney as when he gets played out of position and has a stinker he still gets praise for being selfless and taking one for the team. If Rooney received the shit Fellaini has for some of his performances there would be a national outcry

2901~~~
He was terrible. For someone who's supposed got a lot of physicality, he offered nothing in the way of tackles or interceptions. He lost the ball more than any other United player in the first half. He offered little (perhaps nothing, unless I've forgotten something) in the way of creative, incisive forward moves which helped to create chances. His supposed threat from corners and set-pieces didn't have much of an effect. His discipline, like usual, was terrible. His positioning was, as it always is when he's in midfield, all over the place, since he casually wanders to random places, which results in us getting overrun. It's no coincidence that we improved dramatically once he came off the pitch.

I'm interested, what did he do yesterday that warrants his performance being labelled as decent? Herrera, who you bizarrely mentioned as performing poorly, got a very nice assist. What did Fellaini do of note, apart from failing to do certain things which are required of any passable midfielder?

2902~~~
If anything, he's getting off lightly. But seeing as your eyes are failing you with regards to Fellaini lets look at the stats shall we?

- He had the least touches of anyone bar Lingard and Rashford for us
- He had the worst pass completion rate besides Smalling, Rojo, and Rashford
- He won less defensive arial duels than Daley Blind.
- He made 3 tackles in the entire game and was successful with 2
- He made 0 interceptions
- He made 1 clearance 
- He was dispossessed more times than anyone else on the pitch other than Lazini (4 each)
- He made the least passes of anyone in the back 6
- He competed for 2 offensive arial duels and he had 1 shot

He did virtually nothing. He did not offer us anything defensively, he did not offer us anything in the midfield, and he did not offer us anything in attack. The stats back up absolutely everyones perception other than your own. It's not a case of scapegoating, he was just absolutely brutal.

2903~~~
No attack on the guy himself. He seems like a hard worker etc but I agree, he's simply not fit to play the way we want to play. Prime example was with the simple through ball that was needed on the left wing yesterday which would have set Martial away. He overhit the pass to an alarming extent. It was like a pass to the defender. The only position he can play is up top and it is not what we need.

2904~~~
Hopefully Mourinho will sort out the chief reason that we're lumbered playing him so often, namely aerial ability.

Basically you have Smalling and Fellaini as monsters, and then some "decent" players.

I'm sure Mourinho would come in, instantly get a proper colossus next to Smalling, and probably a couple of other physically strong players too.

A lot of the time, when we play Rooney, Mata, Herrera, 2 skinny winners and shorter fullbacks you do wonder how we'll cope against the Pulis type teams

2905~~~
When are they played out of position? Rooney @ #9/10 is not out of position. Fellaini @ #6/8/10/9 isn't out of position either, or if he has a positio, that is.

2906~~~
Fellaini was no worse than Herrera yesterday?
Is that a serious comment?

I have no idea what game you and Louis van Gaal were watching.

2907~~~
Your comment is as bad as Fellaini's performance!

2908~~~
Rooney was played centre mid and right mid last season. A sack of shit in both and got praised for it.  So you think Fellaini is a natural 6/8/10/9 then

2909~~~
Its Rooney, he gets praised for laying an egg on pitch. He's still gets praised in his absence. Nothing we can do about it. England would flop out of the Euros and Rooney would still get praised.
I don't think Fellaini is a PL footballer for one. Like I stated in an earlier post, he says he's better as a 6, Moyes thinks he's a 10, His Belgian manager thinks he's an 8, LvG said he's a capable 9. Regardless of what position he has been trusted in, he is still rubbish.

2910~~~
But even this is a huge myth. Fellaini is throughly average in the air and again, the stats prove this.

He's 28th in the league for number of ariel duels attempted per 90 minutes and he wins 48% of them.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/nRyPdQk.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/nRyPdQk.png"/>

From that, its already a huge worry that Debuchy - who is 5ft 10 - has a significantly better % rate. More worryingly, someone like Mike Jedinak, who doesn't play a hugely dissimilar role to what we're asking of Fellaini and is only slightly shorter wins 74% of his duels. Even Mikel Arteta attempts and wins a higher proportion of ariel duels than Fellaini (4.19 and 67%).

Now, as a team, we appear to contest ariel duels less than average - Fellaini is our highest rated player in terms of number of attempts per 90 minutes - so you can perhaps discount the number of attempts per 90 minute stat for now. However, as a team, we win 44% of ariel duels. In other words Fellaini is only better than our team average by 4%. The 'ariel ability' he adds to the team is negligible when placed alongside all of the other problems he brings to it.

2911~~~
You can prove anything from stats.
I can see with my own eyes he's very effective defending his own penalty area.

But certainly take the point he doesn't really warrant his place for a team like us

2912~~~
He's fine for defensive headers in his <i>own </i>penalty area, but that's because it generally means all he needs to do is let the ball touch his head and hope it goes in any direction. When it comes to actual aerial duels, or getting a header on target, he's worryingly average. And while he is very capable defensively from corners, it's partly neutered when his midfield wandering and general ineffectiveness/sloppiness will often result in him being one of the reasons opposition sides can form attacks and win corners.

2913~~~
I don't know why anyone is trying to defend his performance yesterday, love him or hate him you should be able to recognise he had a bad game, it has nothing to do with him being a scapegoat. 

He was awful yesterday, he must have given the ball away a dozen times before he won a tackle, other than being useful at defending set pieces he offered absolutely nothing positive and he should have been off at half time, the booing was more frustration that it took so long to take him off rather than anything personal.

2914~~~
it wasn't booing it was celebration he was going off

2915~~~
He won't be getting banned for the elbow/forearm on Emre Can. Bugger.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35803259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35803259</a>

2916~~~
He can feck right off.. Terrible player who doesn't win anything anywhere...  No passing
range no skills no nothing..  We are so much worse with him on the pitch than off it..  The only thing to use him for is when trailing to put him in the box and lump it in there. The booing was just something everybody have been thinking but no one has been doing..  Most of us have had enough of him and LVG they can close the door behind them when they leave..

2917~~~
There was one moment yesterday where Martial was one adequate through ball away from making things very difficult for West Ham's defence, but I just knew Fellaini couldn't pull it off. 

Our joke of a manager is constantly picking this joke of a football in his starting eleven and it boggles the mind.

2918~~~
Not that we have a clue, but what does Giggs think of his inclusion?

2919~~~
That is exactly how you people are scapegoating a single player. Is this some kind of a joke? You are ignoring some games where Fellaini looked much better before injured and some facts. With Fellaini what happen with the one against Liverpool 1-0? What happen with the game when Fellaini play against Southampton and we were 0-0 half time, and then when he was off the Austin scored the winning goal from set pieces? What happen with the game when we won 3-0?
Without Fellaini what happen with the game when we lost against Sunderland and WBA??
You even counted Swansea game when he only played 13th min. You counted Arsenal game when we already lost the game before half time. You count City game when he played only 15 minutes.

Firstly the players need to play more than 45 minutes or be a starter.
Swansea City 2-1 Manchester United (13mins) (Doesn't count)
Manchester United 3-1 Liverpool (90mins) (3 points)
Arsenal 3-0 Manchester United (45mins) (Doesn't count or if you want to count this then count as a 0-0 when Fellaini is on and 3-0 without Fellaini)
Everton 0-3 Manchester United (9mins) (Doesn't count)
Manchester United 0-0 Man City (15mins) (Doesn't count)
Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United (21mins) (Doesn't count or if we count this then count as 0-0 both with and without Fellaini)
Manchester United 0-0 West Ham (90mins) (1 point)
Bournemouth 2-1 Manchester United (74mins) (0 point) (He scored though)
Manchester United 1-2 Norwich City (60mins) (0 point)
Stoke City 2-0 Manchester United (90mins) (0 point)
Newcastle 3-3 Manchester United (90mins) (1 point)
Liverpool 0-1 Manchester United (90mins) (3 points)
Manchester United 0-1 Southampton (45mins) (Since he is starter then count this game but as 0-0, ironic that we lost because Austin scored with header from set pieces which Fellaini could be a better option to mark Austin) (1 point)
Manchester United 3-0 Stoke City (3 points)
Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea (70-80th mins) (remember this game he was on the pitch more than 70th min, the score was 1-0 for us we could have won the game if Fellaini didn't come off for Schneiderlin as Fellaini had a good game and Schneiderlin played poor when he came on and we looked worse when Fellaini was off and then conceded) (1 point but could get 3 points if he stayed)


<b>So total with Fellaini minimum we got 3 won, 4 drew, 3 lost. 1.3 points per game. And maximum we could have got 4 won, 3 drew, 3 lost 1.5 points per game.</b>

<b>And in contrast without Fellaini total 9 won, 5 drew, 6 lost. 1.6 points per game. And if we counted the 1-1 Chelsea game when Fellaini was off and we conceded then 9 won, 6 drew and 6 lost which gave us 1.57 points per game.</b>

I can't see any different if Fellaini played or no. Same results overall and if you watch the game from the beginning of season the style of our play is still the same thing as well.

Manchester United 1-0 Tottenham (3 points)
Aston Villa 0-1 Manchester United (3 points)
Manchester United 0-0 Newcastle United (1 point)
Swansea 2-1 Manchester United (0 point)
Southampton 2-3 Manchester United (3 points)
Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland (3 points)
Arsenal 3-0 Manchester United (0 point)
Everton 0-3 Manchester United (3 points)
Manchester United 0-0 Man City (1 point)
Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United (1 point)
Manchester United 2-0 West Bromwich Albion (3 points)
Watford 1-2 Manchester United (0 point)
Leicester City 1-1 Manchester United (1 point)
Manchester United 0-0 Chelsea (1 point)
Manchester United 2-1 Swansea City (3 points)
Manchester United 0-1 Southampton (45mins) (Since he is starter then count this game but as 0-0, ironic that we lost because Austin scored with header from set pieces which Fellaini could be a better option to mark Austin) (0 point)
Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea (70-80th mins) (remember this game he was on the pitch more than 70th min, the score was 1-0 for us we could have won the game if Fellaini didn't come off for Schneiderlin as Fellaini had a good game and Schneiderlin played poor when he came on and we looked worse when Fellaini was off and then conceded) (1 point and could get 3 points if he stayed)
Sunderland 2-1 Manchester United (0 point)
Manchester United 3-2 Arsenal (3 points)
Manchester United 1-0 Watfrod (3 points)
WBA 0-1 Manchester United (0 point)


It's the same thing with Suarez was being racist to Evra. Is that a reflex to you?? Booing their own player is the thing people who can't think of anything smarter to do because of their obstruction than make a primitive groaning noise. And what makes it even worse is booing one player alone who is still wearing the shirt and tried his best which is the same as disgraceful action from the fans towards their own player.

2920~~~
Some of our best form this season such as FA cup game when Fellaini played, Stoke City 3-0 game and Chelsea 1-1 game which where Fellaini played a very good game. But you know what forget it. it was silly if we are debating which one worst and which one best. They are all the same thing "Bad", even when we won it looks to me they are still boring or poor games. I can only acknowledge Stoke City 3-0 game and Arsenal 3-2 game. But still, doesn't mean it was right to boo our own single player who tired his best.

2921~~~
It means that despite being literally jeered and boo'd by his own fans twice... He still turns out and isn't a spineless coward who hides in the dressing room. He still comes out every game and plays despite it being made obvious (and I am not talking about "oh boo hoo the press wrote some articles", I am talking about literally booed by his own fans here) that the fans don't like him and don't want him in the team.

The manager himself had to basically come out and call the fans a bunch of hysterical bell-ends for giving him that kind of reception. Even if Van Gaal has lost the plot it should tell you everything you need to know about the situation really.
Spot on. He is just a verbal punching bag for over emotional fans thrashing around trying to make sense of why the season has imploded. He may not have been subjected to scapegoating (in the pedantic way Cheesy had to explain it all for us) from the majority of the fans but the over aggressive nature to critique his game as if he was signed from the Forest of Fangorn Football Club is unnecessary. Those users can't be taken seriously.

2922~~~
Bit bizarre how people are saying he's trying his best.

He's bottling out of 50/50s, he's not even arsed tracking his man, he rarely breaks into a sprint and instead slowly jogs around the place, he constantly fouls, he's constantly throwing snide elbows, I can't recall if I've ever seen him make a slide tackle (Don't think I have) he leaves his position countless times and he constantly takes the easy way out...  There was a moment against West Ham where he could have slipped a ball through to Martial, who would have then had an opportunity to create a chance for himself... Fellaini turned around and passed it back to Rojo...

As for celebrating his substitution, it's been 3 years of utter shite from the guy. If he was an Arsenal player, Gooner Claude's head would have exploded after the first 6 months.
Teddy Sheringham got far worse abuse from fans up until that FA cup final in 1999 and let's not forget fans celebrating Giggs' substitution. They were proper disgraces

2923~~~
In some of the games we won you are using to back up your argument he didn't actually play, he has started about three or four league games this season that we have won, whether people like it or not this season we are more likely not win when he plays.

2924~~~
But some of the games we lost, he didn't actually play either. The fact whether he played or no, we did get the same result and performance. Inconsistent, poor results and poor playing style. The point is it's not right to boo your own player.

2925~~~
Wow

2926~~~
Suarez?! Racist?! Wow.... That escalated quickly!

Got it.... Don't boo one player alone who is still wearing the shirt.
From here on I'll reserve booing for racist groups of shirtless players only.
Many thanks

2927~~~
So what's the issue here with Suarez was being racist to Evra?
Fans are booing their own players. Suarez was being racist to Evra. It's the same thing as acting as people who can't think of anything smarter to do because of their obstruction than make a primitive groaning noise. Both are stupid action that come out from mouth which hurting their feeling.

2928~~~
So what exactly should fans do whenever a player is playing cack and not giving his 100%?

2929~~~
So Fellaini is the only one in the team who played cack and not giving 100%???

2930~~~
Its rude to answer a question with another question especially since I've already answered that question

I'll ask again what should fans do whenever a player is playing cack and not giving his 100%? I repeat, this is not about Fellaini but in general.

2931~~~
Just... Wow.

2932~~~
It's called a rhetorical question!! So it's rude when someone used a rethorical question but not rude when fans booing their own single player as a scapegoat? Wow!! 
The answer is already there. So Fellaini is the only one in the team who played cack and not giving 100%??? 
Is it hard to understand? Do I need longer explanation? It's not my fault if you don't understand a rhetorical question!! Fellaini just came back from injury, he's clearly not fit and it's not his fault that the manager started him. But when Fellaini did give his 100% and played well against Liverpool(1-0), Chelsea (1-1), Stoke City (3-0), Derby (FA cup) there is no credit for him but when Schneiderlin, Mata and the rest didn't give 100% and played cack none give them a boo.

2933~~~
Is that the best thing you can answer? Might should just not replying if you can't reply because you know I was right that being racist and booing their own players are both stupid action. If you think they are not then I might should be the one who said "Just... Wow".

2934~~~
Id repeat what should fans do if a player is cack and not giving his 100%? As said before its not about Fellaini but in general. Comeon you can answer to that

2935~~~
From reading this thread you would think he's the guy who got stupidly sent off against West Brom or the guy who gifted Liverpool the goal that finished us off.

2936~~~
Oh in general. Oh Okay let's talk about it in Fellaini thread. Might should just call this as a "general discussion"
I will just gonna answer it to shut you down. Criticised the players. Simple.

2937~~~
You've lost touch with the discussion.... Booing someone for being a terrible footballer, and being racist, are two insanely different things.
I refuse to be dragged into such a bizarre argument.
You think Fellaini is good. You think booing is racist. I disagree with both, let's just leave it at that.

2938~~~
Seems like some of these stats being posted are a bit skewed.

Does anyone have the stats from this season just from the games he started?

I mean i could be wrong but we can't have won more than 3-4 games that he has started from what i can remember.

2939~~~
But how would you criticize the players? Would you just bitch on a forum no player/manager reads? Would you call MUTV a TV station no player/manager (for their own good sake that tv station is poor) probably watches? Please do share your pearls of wisdom with us

2940~~~
Check them out. He started in Stoke City game (3-0), He started in Liverpool (1-0) and (3-1) that's already 3 games. He started in Chelsea game (1-1) which we could have won that game if Fellaini stayed on the pitch who actually had a good game that night while Schneiderlin who replaced him went forward and was jogging to drop back when they launched the counter attack for Chelsea's goal and to be fair he didn't have a good game when he replaced Fellaini. I'm not saying that with Fellaini we will be better, my point is he doesn't deserve to be the only scapegoat.

2941~~~
To be fair mate, isn't booing a form of criticism?

I don't like to see the fans booing our own players, not even the likes Richardson years ago who i didn't like and was also shit as well. But Fellaini has been serving up shit for 3 years now, yes he didn't sign himself and he doesn't pick himself.

But people get frustrated having to watch him every week, it was bound to happen soon rather than later when he keeps getting picked despite it not working or making much sense. I hope Van Gaal takes it on board and gives Fellaini a break as i wouldn't like to see him get booed every week.

2942~~~
Yeah that's what the fans should do. You do realise that media is also involving. The pundit is also criticised players. Booing our own player straight to a single player when there are 11 players on the pitch who also do poor won't make situation better. It makes worse.

2943~~~
Ah so your suggestion is to bitch on a forum no player/manager/admin probably read or call MUTV a  heavily censored TV station no player/manager/admin care about? Smart. .

2944~~~
In a sense of not smart thing to do. Scholes criticised players and manager are what you called it the right way of criticism. Booing players are just people who can't think of anything smarter to do because of their obstruction than make a primitive groaning noise. We did play good football last season in 4141 with Fellaini, Carrick and Herrera in midfield. He did has some good game this season. I'm not saying he's good or United quality but to be fair some of our players also played bad this season and considered to be non United quality but Fellaini is being the only scapegoat.

2945~~~
Scholes can speak on TV. Most fans do not. Their only contact to the players is during the game

2946~~~
Liverpool (h) 3-1
West Ham (h) 0-0
Bournemouth (a) 2-1
Norwich (h) 1-2
Stoke (a) 2-0
Newcastle (a) 3-3
Liverpool (a) 0-1
Southampton (h) 0-1
Stoke (h) 3-0
Chelsea (a) 1-1
3 wins, 3 draws, 4 losses. 

1.2 points per game, significantly worse than when he is not playing, anyone saying otherwise should be a politician.

2947~~~
I already said that's what the fans can if you wanna criticise players. Forum and media are involved by the fans. You also do realise that the players have their own social media account and a lot of people are already criticising players in their social media account. I would be surprise if you think booing a single player in a stadium is a smart thing to do.

2948~~~
Well I guess I was being too much drag the Suarez vs Evra thing. But both of them are not a smart action, that's the point I am trying to make!!
When did I say Fellaini is good? I have been saying this many times already Fellaini has been bad but so does most of our players and our playing style. So Fellaini shouldn't be the only scapegoat.

2949~~~
Cheers

Ok checked them out.

Games where Fellaini started:

P-17
W-6
D-5
L-6

Games where Fellaini did not start:

P-29
W-16
D-7
L-6

Now theres no skewing of stats here including losses for Fellaini where he only came on as a sub or anything. This is simply games that started with or without Fellaini. And just as i thought he is definitely a negative influence and significantly lowers our chances of winning when he starts.

2950~~~
Which forum and which media? 

Also I find criticizing on the player's personal twitter's account is far more abusive than booing them

2951~~~
Oh I thought he was talking about league games. Well I guess it's not my fault, I was just replying his post. It's not like we are expecting to lose without Fellaini against the likes of FC Mitjland, FC Brugge and etc in a capital one cup and FA Cup (you know what teams I am talking about)

2952~~~
He's not the only player having a bad season mate thats true. But he is currently in his 2nd-3rd bad season for us out of 3.

Yes other players are playing bad but it's likely they are just out of form. Is Fellaini out of form?

I don't think that he is out of form this is just how he plays, i don't necessarily think he gets more criticism than other players but if he does it's because he is just so out of place. He just doesn't belong in any side trying to play good football.

The likes of Schneiderlin, Depay etc. are out of form but have the potential to find form and be very good players in a good footballing side. The same cannot be said for Fellaini.

2953~~~
YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and etc. All of these including the pundits well basically all criticism in media, social media, their account and etc would sometime be in the news.
It is madness and abusive. That's why I never do that. But booing a single player is just make it even worse especially after the abuse in media.

2954~~~
Look mate i'm not trying to blame Fellaini for every loss where he started, but those stats i posted are pretty damning are they not?

Theres no real way around it statistically we are a much poorer side when he plays.

And thats before we even get into performances. When he plays we rarely control a game, which is mad because we are supposed to be playing possession football. When we are not even doing that then something in our strategy is going very wrong.

2955~~~
Considering that you believe its madness and abusive then how exactly could fans deliver their message to the club in an appropriate manner? Cause they do have a right to make their voice heard don't they? After all they are the people who are paying these gentlemen's salary.

Please don't tell me the Paddy show

2956~~~
He had a good season last season to be fair. 1st and 3rd season a lot of players are playing bad. To be honest I haven't been impressed with Mata and Fellaini as well in these last three years. 

Schneiderlin should in his prime age now. Potential or no, the point is your performance. Nani has more potential than Park but Park had a better career than Nani. Schneiderlin, Memphis and Fellaini and also the most our players have been poor this season. So Fellaini shouldn't be the only scapegoat.

2957~~~
I don't even read your stats because I'm not the one who start with those stats all I did just back it up as you thought it was incorrect. From the start my point is players have poor this season not just Fellaini so Fellaini shouldn't be the only scapegoat. And booing your own player isn't a smart thing to do. I couldn't care less about stats or whatever. Too much discussion here and I don't wanna involve with something that too stretch from what I have been talking since yesterday.

2958~~~
So basically the fans shouldn't boo Fellaini because that's what Mike09 told them to do. Smart

Are you a season ticket holder by any chance?

2959~~~
Media? Social media? Even now there is a youtube channel called Full Time Devils to help this one out. Didn't we already boo the whole team and manager before this season right? So the fans have been delivered the message to the club in an appropriate manner but all of sudden the fans against WHU yesterday are being unfair for booing a single player only instead of the whole team which most of the players played poor.

2960~~~
If a player underperforms he gets subbed off. That's his "punishment" and that's what happened. If he continues to underperform he'll ultimately be sold. As a fan you have no role in that side of things.

Do you think shouting boo will have an impact on the manager and his decisions?

2961~~~
So basically the fans are there to pay the players, manager's salaries and clap irrespective of the circumstances. A bit like cash cows.  I wonder whether we've got a section called Manchester Youths were kids are forced to wear black shirts and trousers.

2962~~~
I wouldn't boo to just Fellaini. If I was a match going fan Id probably organize a protest. Something like this would be nice for starters since it would basically summarise what I think of the current players, our manager and their performance.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2005/04/juventusfansPA060504_450x310.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2005/04/juventusfansPA060504_450x310.jpg</a>

The fans can increase the pressure by not turning up to the game (imagine an empty OT, that would go well with the sponsors wouldn't they?) or put banners similar to what happens in Italy

There again, I cant be arsed paying a season ticket to watch this crap, so who am I to judge watch match going fans do? Are you a season ticket holder?

2963~~~
I'm not and you did say you sit on comfortable coach well I guess the reason is as what you said you can't be arsed paying a season ticket to watch this crap. But like what I said before the fans have been booing the team and the manager so many times this season it's a reasonable because we have been playing crap and fans don't wanna watch this crap football but all of sudden after booing the whole team and manager what the fans did against West Ham is booing a single player only when the crap football isn't caused by just a single player.

2964~~~
You're a fan. You're there to watch, enjoy, don't enjoy, cheer, shout. You're not part of a trade union with a say in the decision making.

You answered my question with a question but again do you think shouting boo will alter LvG's team selection?

2965~~~
And as said that's something I don't like. However I find it hard to criticize match going fans

a- because they actually spent money and spoiled a day to watch these pampered idiots play
b- because during matches you can observe things that people on tv cant

b may sound patronising but I assure you its not. For example I never really rated Ji Sung Park until I watched 3-4 United matches. The amount of dirty work he did was amazing. He would chase the ball relentlessly throughout the entire game. That demands respect. I also learnt why fans hated Nani so much. The boy was brilliant but Jeez he was lazy. Unless the ball falls perfectly at his feet he wouldn't even bother. These sort of things tend not to be picked up on TV.

2966~~~
I have friends of mine who support teams whose team got busted (1 Nottingham fan, 1 Leeds fan and a couple of Juventus/Parma fans). I assure you that when shit hits fans most of the employees would flee the sinking ship. Players and managers would push for a transfer and the money people will cut the losses. The only people remaining are the fans. They are the ones who will take the abuse and would contribute, sometimes from their own pockets, just to keep the ship floating. So lets treat fans with a bit more respect rather then just expect them to be pathetic drones/cash cows who have to support these mercenaries no questions asked

To answer your question the answer is yes. The fans are the ones who finance the club either directly or indirectly and I've seen fans forcing the club in sacking players and managers. It would be interesting to see Woody convincing the sponsors that we're the biggest club in the world if one day our fans decide not to attend to matches

2967~~~
If you think booing Fellaini will convince LvG to drop him I think you misunderstand managers and in particular LvG. We don't have to guess at this. The fans have done this before with Fellaini and he still gets picked.

2968~~~
But he's not a scapegoat mate plenty of other player are getting flack also, and trust me i know because i hate it when players have been singled out on here in the past.

He is just not good enough nor suited in any way to a team like ours, simple as that.

The comparison to players like Schneiderlin holds no water for reasons stated above. Morgan is a younger player in his first season at the club, he will get better and be able to play in a passing side and not look out of place. The same cannot be said for Fellaini.

2969~~~
Booing is just starters. Id say that its time for United supporters to step up and be counted. They have been accepting this shit for far too long

And Im not referring to just Fellaini. He's just part of a much bigger problem. Its about fecking time that the club stopping talking about being the biggest club in the world and start acting like one

2970~~~
Yea but he was being a scapegoat against WHU. He wasn't the only one played poor at that game.

2971~~~
Hold on mate lets be fair here you yourself posted some stats in Fellaini's favour that were off. You also replied to my post asking about his stats so you can't say you don't care about them once it becomes very clear that statistically we are shit whenever he starts.

If you truly didn't care about stats you wouldn't have entered into discussion with several people about them.

2972~~~
Yeah normally thats true mate but in the case of Fellaini he has been stinking the place up game after game and not being subbed.

Between that and him starting so many games that lead to us being overrun in midfield and rarely winning, it seems the fans have had enough and are letting the manager know their feelings.

Years ago Kieran Richardson kept getting appearances and the fans didn't like it, so they booed him. Ferguson himself has admitted that is the reason he stopped playing him and then sold him. We can all have our own opinions on whether booing your own players is acceptable or not.

But whats not debatable is it is a very effective way for the fans to let the manager know they no longer want to see something that is happening every week when they pay to watch their team play.

2973~~~
But it doesn't matter that he wasn't the only one playing bad. It just doesn't mate, the booing was about more than one game.

The fans are sick of the sight of the guy, no one else in our side is:

A-Completely unsuited to playing the style of football United fans are used to.

B-Detrimental to the teams chances of winning on such a scale as Fellaini. Statistically proven to be as well.

C-Consistently over a 3 year period turning out poor performance after poor performance.

D-Despite playing like absolute dogshit continues to get picked over better actual midfielders and rarely ever gets subbed even when it's clear he offers us nothing. Because we start launching longs balls to him that rarely ever come off and lead to a goal.

Name one player not even in our current squad but in our history over the last 25 years who fits that criteria. Once you think about it you will see why the fans patience finally snapped and they let LVG know their feelings on Fellaini.

2974~~~
Mate!! Why don't you just read everything first before you start making things up here. Firstly, I posted Fellaini's stats because someone was replying my post using league games stats and it was an unfair stats so I was correcting the original poster. Second you are the one who has question or doubt whether the stats is right or no so I answered your doubt and told you to check them out so I don't really care anymore, after that it's your business if you wanna check them out or no, if I care I would have post the whole stats again to you or check the stats that you posted to me but since I don't wanna bother with it again so I didn't read it. And to be honest it shouldn't be called stats, stats should be more specific.

2975~~~
The fans is sick of the guy. Fair enough if fans is sick with a player but what the fans did against WHU  was scapegoating a single player which is unfair. Booing him only because the fans is sick of him but not sick with other players who also have done poor this season including that WHU game.

2976~~~
Eh what did i make up exactly?

Listen mate you posted stats to defend Fellaini i didn't keep track of who started the stats conversation, then you replied to my post about where i was asking for  his stats advising me to check his stats. Which i did.

But once i actually go to the trouble of finding them and posting them, and then those stats without out a shadow of a doubt proving that Fellaini is a negative influence on our performances and detrimental to the tams chance of winning.

After i do that now you don't care about stats, come one mate you can't use stats to defend a player and then say you don't care about them once they don't suit your argument.

2977~~~
Fecking hell mate did you even read my post? 

It's not scapegoating, the booing was about way more than only one match. It's 3 years of frustration boiling over. 

The majority of fans want him out and don't want to see him play anymore. This season is hard enough without having to watch Fellaini lumber about the pitch every week. 

How else do you suggest the fans convey their feelings to the manager?

And please don't say bullshit like Social media or Mutv etc. Van Gaal likely doesn't keep track of either.

2978~~~
You keep missing my point. Fans has been boo the whole team and manager this season and I understand that!! Do I need to say it again? I understand that because I am also sick with almost every single matches that I watched this season. But what I don't understand is in West Ham game how come the fans only boo one single player alone when clearly most of the players played poor and didn't give 100% in that game and if you are making an excuse of fans is sick with Fellaini's performance this season and to be fair some of the players in that West Ham game are also been poor this season.

2979~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Anyone else have to look this up?  Typical frenchy, with your big and fancy words.

2980~~~
I told you before I don't care about your stats!! And I told you before I didn't use a stats to defend Fellaini from the start!! How many times do I need to say this again someone else is using a stats to replied my post not me!!! but I found the stats is wrong and unfair so I correct his stats.
Isn't that's what I have been telling you that I don't read your stats because I don't care of your stat. Correcting his stats is what I wanted and I did it and it should be the ending of it as I don't wanna stretch my discussion here to something that I never wanna talk about because stats was never be my main point of discussion in here, all I did about the stat on this thread was correcting someone else stat and after that it's up to the original poster if he wanted to believe me or no and then you came asked or doubt about it so I told you it was correct and I said if you don't believe me check them out.

2981~~~
At least it reminded me of how sucks my SAT score was.

2982~~~
We're going round in circles here mate. The stats you posted yourself were actually incorrect were they not as another poster pointed out to you?

You use them to defend Fellaini and then say you don't care about them once they show we are actually a much worse team when he starts.

Ok whatever mate.

2983~~~
I think it's entirely debatable. To say it's very effective is a huge overstatement. What proof is there of its effectiveness?

I'd have to see that quote re Richardson. I don't remember him saying that and I just don't see SAF allowing the crowd to decide if a player makes it here or not.

Where do you draw the line though? There's a big group of supporters who've had enough of Rooney, myself included. Should we boo him? What about the group who can't be doing with Memphis, should they boo him? Those who don't rate Valencia, same for them? I could go on. Imagine the atmosphere.

On top of that I thought before his injury he warranted a spot in the side. Not because he was good but because he was marginally less worse than Schneiderlin and Herrera.

2984~~~
Id say we should allow supporters to express their opinion the way they want as long as its legal. Freedom of expression and all

And yeah we do have alot of shit players in the team. No wonder why we're in this sad state. Considering how rich this club is then maybe if we acted more like Real Madrid fans then the loyal cash cows we are then who knows we might have ended up with more Modrices, Bales and Ronaldos and with less Fellainis, Depays and Valencias.

2985~~~
You want to be more like Madrid? A collection of big names with the manager getting sacked every year. That's what fan power gets you.

With regards your first paragraph I think we've already discussed that and it goes without saying. I'm criticising the action but obviously it should be allowed.

2986~~~
Alright If I keep being honest myself saying I don't care this won't stop so I'll make you happy, I'll read it so we stop circle it around and let's make it clear here.

<b><span style="font-family: 'Georgia'"><span style="font-size: 22px">About my stats</span></span></b>
So mind to tell me why the one I posted is incorrect?

<b><span style="font-size: 22px">About who's posting the stats first</span></b>
let me ask you something who was the first one post a stats of with Fellaini and without Fellaini?
Was it me?
No it wasn't me!!
it was someone else use them to defend their opinion because he thinks with Fellaini we played better but I think without Fellaini and with Fellaini we played the same thing as a proof he was ignoring the games after Newcastle United games and including the game where he didn't even start the game and we already lost before he was on so what I did is I am correcting his poster.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>About me defending or not defending Fellaini</b></span>
Did I use them to defend Fellaini?
No! I was correcting his stats.
Did I defend Fellaini on this thread? No I always acknowledge that he's been poor this season but I am also being fair because he's not the only player that poor this season.

<b><span style="font-size: 22px">About your stats</span></b>
Your stats seems to me have more games, while my stats based on league games because the original poster posted only league games so don't ask me why only league games but the original poster.

Your stats has no proof if it is correct or no, while my/his stats I/he gave the detail of the games and the score to show how many win, draw and lose.

2987~~~
Oh please god no. Im actually thrilled of having that big guy with funny hair whose absolutely useless with his feet and head (he's the Leo Messi in terms of chest and elbow play though) and that winger who was moved to RB because he can't dribble or cross anymore. Not to forget the new Duncan Edward, the one who spend most of his career either in the treatment room or headbutting the pitch. No one would want swap these talent with the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Modric, wouldn't they? Hopefully next season we will also get rid of DDG and we replace him with someone more of our standards like lets say Foster or Butland. As a fan, there's nothing better to support the richest franchise in football with its world record number of sponsors than having that money spent on the pitch, to bring in the best managers and players. Who needs Laporte when we can play Mcnair. Who needs Ronaldo when you have Lingard and who needs Modric when you have Failini?

On a serious note, Id like to support a club who back their big phrases (biggest club in the world bla bla bla) on the pitch. We're not the biggest club in the world and haven't been so for quite some time. We're not even CL level FFS. And yes, the way this mighty club has fallen deserve a reaction from the fans. Possibly much worse then booing. If Senile and SAF's love child aren't sacked by next season and some seriously quality players/managers brought in then I honestly question the wisdom behind fans buying a season ticket.

2988~~~
I'd say there's a middle ground between having Fellaini and being like Madrid.

2989~~~
re-read my message

2990~~~
The example i just gave you about Richardson isn't conclusive proof but it gives us an idea that even the top managers will take note of things like a player being booed. I'm not saying that was entirely why he was sold either but after a few weeks when his name was booed at the start of and during games during the 2006-07 season he wasn't played anymore, and then sold. So make of that what you will.

Ferguson when speaking on why richardson was sold said part of the reason was the crowd were getting on his back and booing him and he personally didn't like that. It might have been in his book, i can't remember exactly where i read it.

I'm not even saying i agree with the booing of players in general but with Fellaini something had to be done. He's like a fish out of water out there, i think the boos were more directed at Van Gaal for continually playing him than Fellaini himself.

Neither Rooney being a long term servant or Depay a young kid only a few months into his first season in England are really comparable to Fellaini in my opinion. Both would be unlikely to be booed, but then i've been to OT when Giggs was booed so you never know.

2991~~~
I think that Fellaini is being played because we've got very little choice. Lets face it, this team does sucks

2992~~~
Well to be fair mate i asked you if they were incorrect <b>i</b> never said they were, another poster <a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> pointed out to you that they were incorrect i have no idea if they were right. Seeing as you said you were correcting other peoples stats i just thought i'd offer you the chance to check your own stats. And correct them if they were wrong.

Now that i've had a look at what you posted, to be honest it doesn't make much sense. You seem to discount losses where he came on as a sub. Yet also discount losses where he was subbed off. Am i right?

If he started the game and we lost then he contributed to that loss. Saying a game should be counted as 0-0 or 1-0 because goals were conceded after he was subbed is a bit silly really. 

My stats were solely about the games Fellaini started including cup games which is why there is more games, to be honest it was nothing to do with your conversation with iKeano, i posted asking a general question and you replied to me and you seem to have gotten the impression i had entered your conversation with the other poster. 

As for my stats having no proof, come on mate don't be ridiculous anyone can check them in 5 minutes. Heres a link to all our results this season click on each game for the starting line up.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season2016.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season2016.html</a>

Heres the stats again, please check them if you like. Or don't i don't care anymore if i'm honest.



Games where Fellaini started:

P-17
W-6
D-5
L-6

Games where Fellaini did not start:

P-29
W-16
D-7
L-6

Our win ratio is 55% without Fellaini starting & 35% in games he starts. Which is pretty damning really, had he started all our league games this season we would most likely be in the bottom half of the table.

2993~~~
The squad has it's issues no doubt mate. But he has started games recently where Schweinsteiger, Carrick, Herrera and Schneiderlin have been on the bench at different times. All are superior midfielders.

The fact he keeps getting picked essentially in a position he is unsuited for in a team who plays passing football utterly baffles me. To compound this we are often chasing a game because he has started and yet he is kept on so we can hoof the ball up to him in the hope he can do something which he rarely ever does. It's madness.

2994~~~
Bastian had been injured and is on the wane, Carrick is finished, Herrera and Schneiderlin will need to be rested at one point. LVG's philosophy sucks, there's no doubt about that. However in his circumstances I cant blame him for trying different options. We're really playing pathetically

What I find fascinating is the fact that LVG has yet to play youths there. Surely there must be someone capable of passing the ball straight in the youth academy who would be an upgrade over Failini

2995~~~
The Richardson thing does all seem a bit tenuous. It was one example over 10 years ago, you're not sure if it directly led to him being sold, not sure what the SAF quote was. You can see why I questioned your claim that booing is so effective it's beyond debate.

The problem I think is that you're right about Rooney and Depay but will everybody else see it that way? We disagree on Fellaini, I think he at least competes properly unlike some others so shouldn't be subjected to boos. In the same way I think others will disagree with us about Rooney and Depay. So they'll be getting a chorus of boos as well. 

It'd just be a really cheap, crappy way of going about things. We'd be Madrid.

2996~~~
Jeez at a club like United you do not 'compete properly' but you compete efficiently. Also this obsession with hardwork is lame. Players play in different roles and therefore need different qualities.

2997~~~
Before his latest injury he warranted a spot. 

Schneiderlin started hiding in games(which I think I such worse than anything Fellaini has done) and Herrera's passing was so sloppy that he couldn't complain about being dropped.

Fellaini was at least doing the simple stuff correctly.

Carrick gets away with it for me. Easily the most talented midfielder and at his age I'm not expecting great things. His performances though are so limp. His whole demeanor during the pre KO captaincy stuff is borderline embarrassing.

2998~~~
You do seem to swing between extremes. 

"We're currently poor so let's be more like Madrid."

Now me mentioning hardwork is an "obsession."

It's not an obsession but a universally accepted fact that working hard on a football pitch gives you a big advantage. The great managers of the game have reiterated this throughout the decades. It's also very, very, obvious.

2999~~~
I wouldn't disagree with any of that but even so all three are still better option at CM than Fellaini.

Pereira can play CM i would imagine but LVG doesn't seem to fancy him as a player at all. I'm surprised he hasn't had more minutes with all the injuries we have had.

3000~~~
If not backed by anything else its pretty useless at this level (think of Robbie Savage) and if the player lack pace then it might as well be damaging to the player as he might and probably will resort to other non conventional things (late tackles, shoving players around, elbowing players) to stop the faster players (think of Gary Neville, Fabio Baresi and Rino Gattuso at the end of their career). Does that ring a bell for you?

3001~~~
Yeah it may be a bit tenuous mate i won't deny that, if you choose not to believe it fair enough i don't blame you. I don't know where i read it so i can't post a link to it. I also said i don't know how much it actually influenced him getting sold. He was probably going to get sold anyway.

But it would be naive to think when a player gets booed at United that managers don't take notice. United fans rarely boo their own players.

I didn't like to see Fellaini get booed as i don't hate the guy. But like the majority of the regulars i am sick of having to watch him play if i'm honest. So i'm not going to criticize match goers for how they chose to let Van Gaal know how they feel about Fellaini.

3002~~~
I disagree mate he's been awful all season for me, all four of those players listed are simply better footballers.

And all four should be in the starting line up at <b>CM</b> before Fellaini on the basis that none of them need 3-4 touches to get the ball under control, and they can all pass the ball much better. You say Herrera's passing was sloppy well yeah at times it can be, but even on his worst day it's still better than Fellaini's.

Also all 4 have the added bonus of not being walking red cards waiting to happen.

As i posted earlier this season with Fellaini starting we have won 35% of our games and 55% without him starting. Thats not a coincidence, we are a better side when he doesn't play.

3003~~~
I do agree that he's been awful. I'm in danger here of sounding like a fan.

3004~~~
I'm getting confused here mate, let's make it clear. Did he say mine incorrect? I didn't get any reply from him and told me that it was incorrect. I did say mine is the correct one.


If you read the whole stuff in that post alone, I have already explained the detail and it should answer all your doubt and question why I discount losses when he came on as a sub.
Of course the games against Arsenal 3-0 which he came on in second half, the game has already lost before he came, we were 3-0 down before he came on remember? Games again Swansea and etc which he only came on less than 20 mins I didn't count them because it's to judge if he's getting involve of our losing game if he only played less than 20 mins that's why I only count the game where he played as a starter or more than 45 minutes. And to be fair I don't just discount the losses but also the wins such as 3-0 victory against Everton I exclude Fellaini from the list because he only played less than 20th mins and we already won the game at first half anyway.
And if you look at again the winning, draw and losing ratio that I mentioned, I used 2 scenario where if Fellaini stayed on the pitch against Chelsea we would have secure that 3 points and another scenario which the fact that the game ended 1-1. I showed the evidence and to be fair it was correct and fair.


You didn't post the link to be fair, so it's not my fault if I said your stats has no evidence and proof. And it will take more than 5 minutes to check them mate. And I did say something similar before that a team like us with and without Fellaini are should be expected to win the games with minimum 60% possibility against the likes of FC Midtjyland, FC Bragge, some of our cup and FA cup matches (well you know what teams I am talking about). While the original poster was talking about league games only because it's more for a consistency and all 19 other teams in the league this season could give us 50-50 odd of results. And I did make a proof that when Fellaini is playing or no it didn't make any different in the league.

3005~~~
It could just be the way your stats were presented but it is clear that we don't win much when he plays and results are better without him, it doesn't mean we always win or always play well but there is a clear difference in he doesn't play. And it's nots uprising if you look at this personal stats since he signed they are really poor, he is averaging less than three goals, less than one assist and he doesn't create many chances either.

His stats are bad, his performances are bad and he doesn't improve the team in any way other than defending set pieces, there is no need to boo him but I also think people are making too much of it. Better players than fellaini who gave more to the club have been booed and it's only been a few jeers, ironic cheers and boos on a couple of occasions so I can't imagine he is too bothered.

3006~~~
His form and the negative effect he has on the team is undeniable.

From signing him to how we play him the whole situation has been a mess and most of it's not his fault.

Trying to explain his position under LvG is like trying to explain the Matrix ending. Nobody really knows and anybody who says they can is fibbing to look clever.

3007~~~
Fair enough mate, i just found the way you presented it a bit confusing. That might have been down to me though. The likes of the 3-0 against Arsenal is fine the game was effectively over before he came on. I wasn't referring to the likes of that.

But the likes of the Southampton and Chelsea games where he went off theres no way of knowing that we wouldn't concede those late goals with Fellaini still on the pitch. It's possible we could have conceded more with him on who knows. Plus those were both very low scoring games who's to say him starting and playing most of them didn't cause us to only score one goal on both games, after all we don't often play well when Fellaini starts. Theres just way too many variables to take into account. Which is why i thought it was fair on him to just include the games he started regardless of substitutions.

I didn't post that link originally no sorry, but i didn't think i really needed to. Theres loads of various sites where stats can be checked to make sure they're right. 

To be honest against lesser sides in the cups i would honestly want us to be at the point where we are winning 70-80% of those games like we used to.

I'm going to have to disagree with you on that one mate sorry. Bit of a difference here with and without him, our win ratio in league games where he starts is even lower than in all comps when he starts.

Now for the league games he started it's: P-10, W-3, D-3, L-4. Win ratio 30%

For the league games he didn't start it's: P-19, W-10, D-5, L-4. Win ratio 52%

3008~~~
So what makes you think it's fair to include Southampton game when he didn't play more than 45 minutes because I did say the fair condition should him playing as a starter or more than 45 minutes.
Sure there is no way guarantee we won't concede that's why I used two different scenario, and to be fair our conceded goals against Chelsea was also coming from Schneiderlin (Not blaming a single player only here) who replaced Fellaini at that time. But you can't include the game vs Southampton as he didn't play more 45 minutes. He didn't get enough time to make an impact in that match which is unfair if we include him as one of the reason we lost is because Fellaini started the game.

Back again to yours one I don't think it's fair to put Southampton game in that list. Should be P-9, W-3, D-3, L3 (1.33 points per game with Fellaini) (And I still included 1-1 draw vs Chelsea since he played more than 45 minutes even though we conceded when he was off).
I made a mistake for the won, we won 10x as I forgot Watford game is our victory. Should be P-/20 W-10, D-5, L-5 (1.75 points per game without Fellaini).
I still don't see it as a much different if we have Fellaini or no on the pitch. Either he is still on the pitch or no we would still has the same average of loss and draw but more won average but that's because we played more that twice of games without Fellaini.

3009~~~
Well to be honest mate if you start a match and play half of it. And in that half the team plays shit and doesn't score, then in my book you contributed to that loss just as much as anyone else in the team. So i think it's fair game when adding up Fellaini's stats to include that as a loss. I don't see how we don't include it.

But think about it mate we lost 4 out of 19 without Fellaini 21% loss ratio and lost 4 out of 10 with him in the side 40% loss ratio. So effectively we lose twice as many games when he's in the side.

Thats not how percentages work though. We didn't just win more games because we played more games. It's a percentage of those games, so even if you halved it to 10 games Eg. P-10, W-5, D3, L-2 our win ratio would still be over 50% without him compared to 30% with him in the side.

Do you see where i'm coming from now mate?

3010~~~
This is why I've been saying this before yours can't be called as a stats mate. It's not specific and no detail on it. It's the exact same thing with what those Sky Sport's stats which is what people called them as pointless. People might think how can Smalling is considered as one of the best centre back in the league this season if United have been playing poor and conceded a lot, but they ignore the fact that it's not Smalling's fault for all of those issue. People called Smalling had a poor game against Arsenal 3-0 defeat but fact is he played well and was our best player in that game but people called him poor because of the score and ignoring the contribution he made and the fact of why we conceded.

You can't judge or blame players when he didn't involve on the pitch at all even in a slightest percentage for the caused of conceded goals or our loss, Fellaini was in a 0% involved for the conceded and loss in both Southampton and Chelsea. This is basically about when Fellaini played or when Fellaini didn't play. When Fellaini played did we conceded goal against Chelsea? We were leading 1-0 mate, but when Fellaini was off we conceded! And you are ignoring this thing. Did he play when we conceded? Is it his fault that we lost 3 points in that game?
When Fellaini played against Southampton, we were 0-0 at half time and I am actually surprised he was off but stayed on the pitch against Liverpool (Europa) and WHU (FA). I thought he had a good first half but poor games against Liverpool and WHU. Did he play when we conceded? Is it his fault that we conceded and lost that game?

We lost 3 games when Fellaini was playing and won 3 games and could have won 4 games when he was playing. You are keep blaming the result of Southampton and Chelsea as it was his fault that we conceded when he wasn't even on the pitch, how fair is that?. And it's not like we played better when he was off against Southampton and Chelsea anyway!

3011~~~
Stats are stats are stats mate. They generally don't have detail or include the context. They are statistics. Those stats are factually correct, in simple terms what they tell us is that when Fellaini starts we win less and lose way more. And when he doesn't start we win more game and lose less. 

Everything else you keep talking about and referring to as detail is all subjective. You see it one way but i see it another. But stats are basically facts they are in not really subjective one way or another. They can be skewed yes, but i think i am being fair on Fellaini by only counting games in which he started. I have seen others include games where he only came on as a sub for 10-15 minutes as a loss in Fellaini's stats, now that is unfair.


You are completely missing the point mate. Whether he was on the pitch when goals were actually conceded or not is irrelevant. A match lasts 90 minutes against Chelsea he played 79 of those 90 minutes. We drew 1-1 we only scored one goal while Fellaini was on the pitch, had we scored 2 we would have won but we didn't and Fellaini played his part in that. 

For the Southampton game he played in half of it when we were shit and didn't score, so he also contributed to that loss. By your logic if we had scored 3 goals after he went off would you still count it as a draw in Fellaini's stats?

Honestly mate to argue that you can only judge his performances and whether or not he has a detrimental effect on the team on full 90 minutes appearances is absolutely ridiculous. 

Even without those two games his league stats are still damning, P-8, W-3, D-2, L-3 so the loss ratio only comes down slightly to 37.5% from 40%. It's clear no matter what way you want to try to skew these stats mate that he is a massive negative influence on our teams prospects of winning football games.

3012~~~
Yeah but it's a pointless stats just like Sky Sport one. What's the point showing the result but ignoring the fact what actually happened during the game and what the players do during that game. A good stats should be more detailed and specific so there is no mistake or misunderstood. You are including the list of where he has 0% involved on the pitch when we both lost the game and losing a point. And the point is what's the difference when he was playing or no. Against Chelsea and Southampton when he was playing and not we got two completely different result. 



The thing is you were talking about the stats whether it's true or no, you were against it because I exclude the Southampton game. And now let me tell you the original poster posted the stats by replying my post that said <b>"With Fellaini and without Fellaini we are still playing bad" (Check it out on page 72). </b>So the point is not just the result but we played the same thing (poor) against Southampton when he was playing or wasn't playing but got a different result.
And we played much better when Fellaini was on the pitch against Chelsea and worse when he wasn't playing against Chelsea and we got another different result when he was on and off the pitch. I haven't been missing the point mate, this is about what happened during the game when Fellaini was there or no. Result, performance any change and difference. Nothing different overall this season with or without Fellaini. 'Bad' that's all I can describe them.

3013~~~
Fellaini is a waste in midfield,if you have to play the thug put him up front. He isn't a good at passing, running, winning tackles or dictating play.When we play him in midfield, we may as well be a man down, we are always over run. I don't like to see him get booed off the pitch. With that said, I don't like him elbowing people in nearly every match either. He was never wanted here and is always the Moyes reminder. He was very important in getting top 4 last year, many people forget that. Probably because it seems pointless now. It's best for him and united to part ways at the end of the season. If you want to get angry, you need to direct it at Van Gaal for selecting him. It's not Fellaini's fault he's not been playing to his few strengths(position) and is put in the team. It's that deluded clown of a manager. A part of me dies when I see his name on the team sheet. Then seeing Schneiderlin on the bench beside Herrera and even Schweinsteiger...This season had been beyond a farce.

3014~~~
The issue I have is that the criticism Fellaini gets is over the top. I understand that people don't like him and don't want him in the team, or they just think he isn't a good player. I just don't see how they can want him out of the team so badly as they think his replacements are any better. Herrera, Schneiderlin, Carrick and even Schweinsteiger in patches (but probably less so) have all struggled just as badly this season - in my opinion.

If Fellaini was being picked over a CM who was actually in good form then I could understand the frustration, but he really isn't. Whoever is in there gives a performance that usually ranges from 4-6 on a rating scale.

3015~~~
I am only French when I need to be. 

Also, I think if this thread has taught us anything, it is that using "games won when X is in the side" is a horribly poor metric and explains absolutely sod all. By that kind of silly logic Daley Blind is the worst player to ever play for us and we can blame this entire season of shambolic results on him because he's not missed a game.

3016~~~
Don't worry about the french criticism, it's a cheap jibe used only people disagree with you. We've been there.

3017~~~
Essentially this. I think Fellaini is just theee symbolic space goat. Let me be clear. I'm not a fan of his and also don't want him in the side/don't think he's United quality but the criticism, in comparison to his peers, is a bit OTT.

I think a lot of our fans just see him as a metaphor which sums up our struggles. He's a Moyes signing (who most on here hate I think), which we overpaid for (due to Moyes again), who's not good enough for a title chasing team (unless he played for a Pulis type team who'd ever be challenging up there!) and at his best, he promotes a certain style of play which isn't easy on the eye. To top it all off, he's a freaking nasty/dirty player as well.

Then he still puts in criminally shit performances, albeit, in a position a manager is picking him in which isn't his best. I think I'd probably speak for a good few on here who'd much rather give Pereira & co. (youth) a chance at CM then. Watch them struggle - at least they'd have an excuse. (which wouldn't mean that they'd be immune to negative reviews/some even writing them off - but such is the nature of football fans).

3018~~~
Seriously mate are you on a fecking wind up?

I just included the stats of the games without the Chelsea and Southampton results because you keep using it to defend him. And guess what we are still shit with him in the side. Did you miss that bit?

Here it is again, P-8, W-3, D-2, L-3 so the loss ratio only comes down slightly to 37.5% from 40%.

So what now, we lose 21% of games without him and 37.5% with him excluding matches you insist on being omitted for silly reasons. Even then when skewing the stats to make him look better it's still blatantly obvious the effect he has on our team. He's shit and he makes us even shitter than we already are.


Nah mate you are still missing the point or purposely ignoring it to be honest this is tedious beyond belief now.

You are focusing on two minor details and using it to try to argue that Fellaini isn't that detrimental to the team. News flash he was playing shit in both the Southampton and Chelsea games. He without a doubt hindered our play and as a result we only scored 1 goal over two matches. The score lines when he was taken off were in spite of his presence not because of it. We weren't beating Chelsea because Fellaini was in the team.

Which ever way you want to twist things theres no way around it he has been awful all season. And everytime he plays we are a worse team because of his presence. So you keep banging on about the Southampton loss and the Chelsea draw having nothing to do with him because he was taken off 10 minutes before the end like it even matters to the overall point. Or changes the fact this year Fellaini has been one of the worst players to pull on a United shirt in living memory if that makes you feel better.

3019~~~
No chance mate, none are pulling up trees. But come on all four are infinitely better midfielders and footballers in general than Fellaini. It's not even debatable.

This place is fecking nuts.

3020~~~
One of my favorite players last year, really turned a corner. This year has been woeful, but still grateful to him for scoring grucial goals for us last minute.

Should be moved on though, and he probably will fetch a good price given his heroics last season.

3021~~~
I'm not disputing that most of them aren't better footballers, Schweinsteiger for example is obviously a much better footballer than Fellaini, but I honestly don't see their form as being that different. Carrick can hardly move these days, Schneiderlin has matches where you don't even notice him (not in the good way) and Herrera has games where he constantly gives the ball away. Obviously Fellaini has matches where he makes similar kinds of mistakes. None of them have been overly impressive this season. People moan when Fellaini gets picked but honestly no one else has been any better? 

Of course this is just my view, if you think the others have been noticeably better then that's fine. We just see different things.

3022~~~
You are right on that bit.

3023~~~
I don't know why people are moaning that Fellaini is been slated here for being an awful footballer. United fans have ripped into better players for less. Cleverly, Anderson, John O'Shea, Fletcher, Gibson, Nani et al, despite being better players and contributed to the squad than Fellaini would ever do have been called so many names but I don't recollect many coming to their defence.

3024~~~
Evidently mate. All of them are better footballers. Even on their worst days all four of those players, Carrick and Schweinsteiger especially are still better passers of the ball and have a better first touch than Fellaini on his best day. On that basis alone all four should be picked in Midfield ahead of Fellaini.

I mean we are supposed to be a passing possession based side and we play a guy in CM who can't pass for shit because he's good at headed clearances. It's madness.

3025~~~
Yeah but i would hazard a guess we have different views on why though.

3026~~~
Oh yes <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3027~~~
Who cares if they're better? They've been woeful for us all season. I'd say Fellaini has been better than Carrick and Morgan, and is on par with BFS who's been garbage all season. In fact, I can't even put Herrera in front of him who's been poor for most of this season as well.

All in all, our CM's have under-performed all season, hence why we're 6th in the league.

3028~~~
What does that even mean?

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Jeez, your sarcasm meter down?  You frenchies sure are touchy. <a class="username" data-user="49797, @Rooney in Paris" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49797/">@Rooney in Paris</a>

3029~~~
I do. Fellaini better than Carrick yeah ok.

3030~~~
Carrick has been a spineless coward this season. I'd much rather see Fellaini than Carrick, this season.

3031~~~
As far as I can see, nobody actually said Fellaini was a better player than our other midfielders, but rather that his performances have arguably been better (and certainly no worse) than theirs.

3032~~~
You are joking right?

3033~~~
If Fellaini starts or plays against Liverpool, i have no hope of United getting anything from the game.

3034~~~
No.

3035~~~
In three years he's rarely dominated as he did at Everton and for Belgium. He was never good enough to build a team around for Manchester United. But with the instability he got chances and failed time and again. His time is up and the phasing out should start now.

3036~~~
To even say Fellaini's performances have been better as a central midfielder than other players who can actually fecking pass is for me ridiculous.

He has been much worse in my opinion. And the stats seem to back that up.

3037~~~
Well needless to say i disagree with everything you have said i would rather have any other midfielder from our squad in CM before i would have Fellaini in there, and probably a few other players are aren't even midfielders as well.

He brings very little to the table outside of defensive headers and we are a worse team when he plays. 

You are entitled to your own opinion of course.

3038~~~
Oh mon Dieu, yours seems to be fecked up too.

Damn Google Translate.

3042~~~
Some of Schneiderlin and Herrera's passing has been terrible. I think you're paying attention to reputation more than what's happening on the pitch.

Though I agree in that they're only worse at certain times. If the two happen to be playing a little better I'd always have them in before Fellaini.

3043~~~
That's true mate i'm not trying to say different, at times both have been poor passing wise. But Fellaini's passing is terrible all the time and thats my main problem with him playing in CM, we can't control games offensively when he's in there because his touch and passing are woeful. And because he often goes walkabout and leaves his midfield partner isolated we more often than not get overrun in there like last Thursday.

And trust me my opinion on players is only from what i see on the pitch every week.

3044~~~
When I am flying into France and I pull out my French passport to be checked, that is usually one of the times I need to be French.

3045~~~
Whatever. This discussion will have no end if we keep circle this around. And I even tell you my original post and you still think I am defending Fellaini, and clearly what I have been saying is we are still playing poor when he was playing and not. What I have been doing is blaming all players for not playing well and manager tactic but you are scapegoating Fellaini for those results. This is what happen when someone only rely on % of stats without watching the actual game especially the ones against Southampton and Chelsea. I can't believe you actually blaming and assuming Fellaini started the game is the reason why we lost point in those games.

3046~~~
I think the main problem with him is that whilst he can look as an individual that he is contributing (i.e. in Liverpool game second half where he won the ball a lot) his impact on the rest of the team is too negative imo, he takes too much away. With him purely offering a physical presence in the midfield and no real creativity and mostly only threat from set pieces (which tbh it's not like he gets a lot of goals/assists even from them- though in fairness our deliveries often are poor), coupled with say Schniederlin or even Carrick who's struggled recently and neither of which are particularly creative, there's just not enough happening in the middle. Add to that he's quite tactically indisciplined (I actually think this is something LVG wants him to do but a lot of the times it causes more problems for us I'd say).

Add to that he just does not fit in with what the players around him want to do. Personally I'd say whilst the quality isn't always there the likes of Mata, Martial, Herrera, Depay, Rashford are on similar wavelengths and can compliment each other. Fellaini doesn't. For example he'll play the ball wide out Martial on the left and then get in the box aiming for a cross, that for me isn't Martial's strength. We should be looking to bring him in closer to the box where he can run in and create an opening (personally I think it's crazy that we don't base our game plan on the left on getting Martial in to these positions). He doesn't play the ball quick enough in tight areas where we can work something. Ultimately his aim is to play it wide and get it in the box, similar in many ways to Rooney when he plays deeper. Problem is we don't have any good crossers in those sorts of areas.

Fellaini as he is could work in a system where we have much more reliable attackers who could do things more consistently as individuals. For example whilst I think Fletcher at his best was much more than a destroyer in the middle, back in say 09 when we played him there with again a slower/deeper partner in the middle it didn't matter so much that between him and say Carrick they weren't particularly creative because they would retain possession and use it smart and give to the likes of Ronaldo or prime Rooney who could then do something with it. We're not in that position atm and we can't constantly have a player in the middle who offers very little to team rhythm/build up in open play. If Fellaini could play as the deepest midfielder then it probably would be ok but we don't have the attack in play to have him play in the role he does. This is a bigger problem against teams that sit back on us than against teams who will come at us where he can be effective there as more space opens up on the counter.

It really is odd how much LVG seems to rate him, as the stats show he does seem to have on the whole a considerably negative impact on the team. I mean I think he can be effective in certain situations and he has proved that but LVG has elevated him to a level of importance that I personally find bizarre. None of the teams around us/internationally need a player like him and certainly don't start one as often.

3047~~~
Good post, agree with all of it. 

Signing him was frustrating, playing him so often more so. The way we use him though is the biggest failing.

Against us I always remember him receiving the ball in the penalty area(or on the edge) with his back to goal. From there he's difficult to knock off the ball and would use his angular awkwardness to roll defenders or lay it off.

We've stopped him doing that and moved him 20 yards further back. From which distance the games becomes more complicated for him.

You should always get footballers to do what they're good at.

3048~~~
Cheers. Yeah he either needs to be used as a number 10 which personally I don't want as we shouldn't need to play that way and also no one else bar him suits that approach in the team or be used more as an impact player. As I said he can be a useful squad player for us but it's crazy that he's almost a cert to start when he's fit.

3049~~~
Will start tonight. No doubt about it.

3050~~~
Yeah he always seems to start when fit.

Sadly if he does I can't see us winning.

3051~~~
Back about a month ago, I think it was two games again Liverpool and Southampton. In the first one we had Fellaini playing, had the lead, took him off after about 80 minutes and Southampton scored a late equaliser from a header from a set piece (possibly a corner): the sort of thing Fellaini has been comfortably defending all season.

The following game (again I think it was a Liverpool game but not sure) Fellaini didn't play and we conceded another two goals from set pieces.

After that, I suspect LVG sees Fellaini as almost one of the first names on the team sheet, especially if we play Blind at CB who is not particularly physical or good in the air.

Fellaini is an average passer, gets up and down the pitch well to contribute at both ends. He adds some steel and physicality to the midfield which in my opinion is something needed. Frankly I think Fellaini is something of a leader on the pitch - he isn't a coward, he always gives it 100% and doesn't give up when the chips are down - these are all qualities which his detractors laugh off and label as unimportant, but I have seen games without Fellaini where our team looks utterly void of any aggression, passion or leadership, and basically look like a bunch of cowards.

What I like about Fellaini in our current system is that he is able to play a more box to box role in a 2-man midfield, when compared to the likes of Carrick, Schneiderlin and Herrera. The trouble with a 4-2-3-1 when we play with two pure holding midfielders is that it leaves the attack a bit undermanned. It has been a cause of endless frustration at times this season that even against teams that we should have been comfortably beating, we play such a defensive lineup and it stifles our attack. Fellaini supports the attack, presses defenders when appropriate, but still gets back and does a good amount of defensive work in our own half. 
Of course, when his detractors see this, they just say that he has no positional discipline and pass it off as a bad thing, but I would prefer seeing Fellaini getting up and down the pitch than another infuriating Carrick/Schneiderlin game where neither is prepared to get forward or leave the halfway line.*

I have always said I would prefer us to playa proper 3-man midfield like we did last season, and that he entire team would benefit from it. But as long as we are playing 4-2-3-1 I prefer to see a box to box player who can support the attack, than two dedicated holding mids.

*regarding Herrera, it is difficult to classify him, but I think LVG sees using him in a 2 man midfield as a bit unbalanced to use against decent opposition, though this is just my view of course.

3052~~~
Let's hope he's on the bench tonight.

3053~~~
I find this bit exaggerated

3054~~~
If he starts tonight, we go out. Simple.


Edit: Man I'd love to have egg on my face with this statement.

3055~~~
We never had the lead against Southampton. They scored in the last minute and we lost 0-1. Fellaini came off at half time because he was awful. Really awful.

The following game was Stoke, we beat them 3-0. We played Liverpool the game before Southampton and beat them 1-0.

3056~~~
He is incredibly average as a cm so if he starts there for us it doesn't bode well.

3057~~~
We lost to Southampton 1-0 and beat Liverpool 1-0 a week before that. Fellaini was taken off at half time in that Soton game, not after 80 minutes. No wonder you see his performances differently to the majority here, you don't actually remember them! 

I agree that LVG sees Fellaini as one of the first names on the team sheet. I just do not believe this is a reasonable and good thing. And if he did indeed base it on one game, then why not the Newcastle game at St. James' Park, where we conceded three and were aerially dominated throughout despite having Fellaini?

3058~~~
The problem with him playing is that everyone, especially the defenders and keeper, start hoofing it to him. It's a bloody eyesore. 

If we were to actually cut out that tactic, I'm certain that he'd actually be far more useful.

3059~~~
If Van Gaal had bought a reliable CB to partner Smalling then he wouldn't need to have Fellaini starting as much for his defensive ability on setpieces.

3060~~~
A friend of mine asked me why he has big hair like he does because it can actually affect his panoramic view. Does he have a point ? I have no idea tbh.

3061~~~
You'd think it would affect him wouldn't you. Either in reducing vision, or being bloody heavy.

But as he's had it like that for so long, and seemingly no club has told him to sort it out, perhaps not.

3062~~~
In terms of him starting tonight, there's no real need, as Liverpool aren't stacked with tall goons.

Therefore, I'm hoping for a more dynamic mid and attack

3063~~~
Why?!!
Starting again, no words...

3064~~~
Is anyone really surprised though.

I really hope he proves me wrong tonight. Somehow.

3065~~~
I just put on a hoodie to sort of replicate his hair and honestly it has to affect him somehow.I felt limited and restricted. It's a bit stupid that a pro footballer who is poor enough already, would handicap himself <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3066~~~
Maybe someday when he really needs to play his best, he will cut his hair (like someone who trains with weighted clothing/body weights) and he will be amazing.
Unfortunately today doesn't look like that day.

3067~~~
He's gonna run the show tonight. Dominate physically and drive us to victory with slick passing and a deft touch. Come on Fellstar

3068~~~
You get guys with dreadlocks and stuff playing footy that also can't help. But for some the hair is part of their identity.

I'm sure someone like Pat Rafter, was getting whiplash from his long hair so had to trim it. That's the only time I've heard of hair affecting performance.

3069~~~
I hope the next manager free transfers him

3070~~~
After apparently getting away with smashing someone last game, it should be textbook that he has a big impact on the game.
Bit like Payet diving and should have seen red, then scoring that goal.

3071~~~
This is made me spit my pint out. Well done lad.

3072~~~
fecks sake.

3073~~~
Elbows are out. Red tonight I reckon.

3074~~~
What is his problem?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Like...has a manager never taken him aside, and just told him to just stop doing it?

3075~~~
Some of them are genuine but I dont think all of them are, many players do it but because of his height it looks far more dangerous/un purpose. Still should get booked and get red when it's obvious.

And is playing better than Mata.

3076~~~
He's fab.

3077~~~
He is in fact having a decent game.

3078~~~
Not playing too bad, looks like he has a brain today. Depay and him just have those sometimes.

3079~~~
Probably our best player that half.

3080~~~
He's been class tonight if only he could be like this more consistently.

3081~~~
He is doing great.. When the defence is pressed, the defenders  are passing to his head.. and he is releasing Martail/Rashford..

3082~~~
No, he's not, our midfield is non existant defensively, and he is offering very little in attack too. Not the worst one, but he is still a problem. When is he going to be an attacking threat if he is already pushing so high?

3083~~~
He gets a lot of stick and he shouldn't be playing for Manchester United, the sad thing is he is a much better player than a lot of the ones getting games for us at the moment.

3084~~~
He had a good first half I thought. Work his shocks off. Keep it up in second half.

3085~~~
Agreed. The late runners have been there all half for Liverpool to cause us havoc. Carrick has been there to try and fight it, Fellaini has not. For that, despite some good fleeting moments, he cannot be rated as having a good game overall. I don't understand what people are watching to suggest otherwise on the whole.

3086~~~
I agree with this. Liverpool have had way too easy running at the defense because they have an entire highway in midfield with zero protection whatsoever. The expectations have been set so low with him that a nice touch here and there turns into a "great match".

3087~~~
Our best midfielder out there today. Make of that what you want.

3088~~~
I think even their counterattack for the goal came because he pushed high and left the midfield wide open when Marttial tried to play him. Or was that before the goal?

3089~~~
At the end of the day no full back should get skinned like that off a player of Coutinho's stature, it was a simple drag past Varela, shocking defending.

3090~~~
Yeah, I'm still not seeing the idea that he's had a particularly good performance, unless not completely fecking everything up is now enough to qualify. He's not really offered anything creatively, certainly. He isn't consistently creating dangerous chances. He isn't taking players on, or taking efforts himself. He isn't knocking dangerous long balls to Rashford which would unsettle the Liverpool defence. He's hardly controlling/dictating the game. That'd be fine if we were getting his physical presence...but we're not. He hasn't really done much in the box from set pieces, for example.

He's also a massive liability postionally. I noticed at some point in the game we looked very suspect and open whenever Liverpool progressed forward...and it's probably in some part due to the midfield. Fellaini's box to box sometimes, but in a really inconvenient way. Like...he kind of just wanders around wherever he feels like. In particular, he enjoys occupying the position of a central midfield full-back, somewhere between our midfield and left-back. He wanders back at an incredibly leisurely pace, and isn't offering any danger in an attacking sense.

He did have a really nice moment when he kept the ball in after a long ball to create a chance that was then missed, but again, not much apart from that. Not as bad as Sunday though.

3091~~~
Very good so far and comfortably one of our best players.

3092~~~
Yep, he and Carrick are smooth today.

3093~~~
He didn't do much work when Henderson got into the best chance of the game.

3094~~~
I think the two make use defensively frail at the back without offering too much up front. They're too slow to deal with the Liverpool players and don't manage to close the space in midfield well enough which has left us open too much.

3095~~~
Carrick is lucky he gets excused everytime.

In fact, its great to see any midfielder that partners him never has any blame. All Fellainis fault. Its not Fellainis fault Carrick is not faster than a snail and lets everyone walk past him. 

Fellaini has done his job brilliantly. Hes been a great outlet and linked midfield to attack really well. Carrick on the other hand has let everyone waltz past him. Were playing one DM and its Carricks job to protect our defense, but hes failed time and time again.

3096~~~
Carrick has been decent tonight IMO. Passing has been progressive and he has looked after the ball. Fellani, a mixed bag as usual.

3097~~~
This is daft, though. Players like Carrick and Schneiderlin have been getting criticised regularly for their poor performances. Just look at how many people are saying Carrick is done.

3098~~~
This is the Fellaini thread so no reason to mention Carrick('s poor performance) in here. Fellaini has been poor IMHO. I must be watching another match really.

3099~~~
That could have been a red. Tit.

3100~~~
He elbows at least one player every game, it's ridiculous.

3101~~~
He's an idiot.

3102~~~
WHY IS HE STILL PLAYING!??!

Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Herrera...

NO, LETS PLAY FELLAINI

feck Van Gaal if Herrera leaves...

3103~~~
"Lovren is the latest player to be elbowed by Fellaini".

At least the text to the game has a sense of humour

3104~~~
He has been okay, the problem is today we needed something much better than "okay".

3105~~~
The Leo Messi of elbowing

3106~~~
Name one.

3107~~~
Can't pass, can't tackle, can't shoot, can't dribble. Can elbow. First name on the team sheet. Louis van Gaal's United.

3108~~~
His positioning is one of the most enigmatic things I've seen in football. I will call characterise him as "false winger" from now on.

3109~~~
you mean false football player

3110~~~
Better than the weekend at least, should have been sent off though, use of his elbows is disgusting and cowardly though.

3111~~~
Just embodies the lack of quality in the team at the minute 

He's tried but he's just too limited as a footballer 

There's 5 or 6 at least in the team tonight who are simply not good enough

3112~~~
One of his best games for us so far. Still a 1/10 for a manchester united player. He was even worse than a dead 35 years old. Useless player. Always late for our attacks always late for our defence.

3113~~~
Hardly. Ive seen this excuse used many a time.

3114~~~
Agreed. 

He isnt good enough. 

Our players have performed so well today but the bar is low. Too many average players out there.

3115~~~
Decent first half, reverted to type in the second. 

Could honestly get sent off every game he plays. Not a United quality player.

3116~~~
No more!!!

3117~~~
Rojo, Varela and Lingard are three that played tonight.

3118~~~
Played reasonably well overall, but his constant elbows are never going to go away. He could have been sent off twice tonight and another two times last week.

He's strong enough to win battles without having to attack the other player.

3119~~~
One of the most frustrating aspects of his game. He's often absent in sustained attacks by the opposition where we're barely holding them off and could do with an extra man. But he's also often absent from attacking moves, where he should ideally be lurking on the edge of the area to pick up any spoils, unless he's got a decent opportunity to make his header. Except, sometimes he'll just decide to plonk himself inside the box, like when he was next to Rashford, basically occupying Rashford's space which he was already in himself. It's extremely worrying when one of your players has no basic concept of how to position himself on a football field.

3120~~~
He did what he does to a passable standard. The issue is that he has no diacernible talent whatsoever, and therefore his presence at the heart of a Manchester United team is farcical.

3121~~~
Constantly gives the ball away because he's slow on the ball, having said that he's far from our worst player.

3122~~~
Would be happy if he never wears the shirt again tbh.

He offers literally nothing. The only small in advantage he has in the air he negates by elbowing people's heads off and getting fouls. Even in the air half the time his headers are too weak too trouble the keeper anyway!.

He can't shoot, can't dribble, his passing is average at best. I really don't see what LVG likes about him. His record for us recently says it all too. 

No team Starting fellaini in midfield will win a title or trophy, it's that simple.

3123~~~
It's a proper sad that he actually outperforms majority of players on our team and is just not up to the standard. At least he tries.

3124~~~
Had quite a good game in general. Linked up well with the others and drove us forward a number of times. Unfortunately when it comes time to make the final ball he just lacked that quality needed.

3125~~~
He was ok in the first half, not good like some are saying but ok, however we were pushing our fullbacks on and he never tucked in to help them when Liverpool broke, that is what a DM does, watch Kante for Leicester show how the role is played properly. I know he can't help not getting over there because he's so immobile, but that goes back to our stupid manager playing him as a CM in a 2 man midfield. In the second half he mostly just lumbered around and threw a couple of elbows.

3126~~~
I'm starting to feel bad for Fellaini, he's become a laughing stock; he just hasn't got enough in his locker to play at the level we aspire to. Perhaps one day LVG will realize that his "strengths" are heading the ball and fouling the opposition. Injuries aside, the fact he's played the 90 demonstrates how poor we've been in the transfer market.

3127~~~
You call this is a good game from him?He literally offered nothing substantial in the second half and bottled a good chance created by Rashford.Can the UEFA ban him for elbowing?

3128~~~
His game was like a sine curve. Had good moments and elbow moments, decent passes and poor positioning, a bit comfort on the ball and poor finishing

3129~~~
Pretty much. Even his first-half performance, which is being praised, saw him offer nothing of note. I saw people praising him, and tried to rack my brains for what he'd done well, but I was struggling. He wasn't controlling the game, or creating chances, or offering an attacking threat, so what was he actually doing well? Has it gotten to the stage where he gets a pat on the back for not being completely awful?

3130~~~
Stupid yellow, ok game.

3131~~~
This. Even the shit he does 'well' is no where near good enough for Manchester United. For fecks sakes, I hate this he had a good game shite.

3132~~~
I'm physically and psychologically tired of watching him play for us. A virtually pointless player, he isn't a playmaker, he isn't a striker, he isn't a CM ... I cannot honestly believe that many fans think he's played well.

3133~~~
Tells you how little we expect from him if this counts as a decent/good game. Pointless footballer.

3134~~~
He didnt have a good game. Absolutely not. Pwerfully rubbish, just hide in the reserves till you can find a new club.

3135~~~
He can't pass or shoot and isn't defensively minded either. Literally all he can do is throw elbows and head balls.

3136~~~
Hes not a player for any top 4 team, but cant be faulted he doesnt pick himself, and today he was one of our better players, won almost every header, held the ball well, even passed forward and tried to drive us forward a good bit today

3137~~~
Had a real 10 minute purple patch in the first half but then reverted to type in the second half. He just isn't the sort of footballer you associate with any team aspiring to be amongst footballs elite.

3138~~~
Hope he elbows someone on Sunday, with all this attention any further elbows will result in a 3 game ban.

3139~~~
I wish some of the other players tried like he does. He's not good enough, but technically skilled players that go missing are worse.

3140~~~
I wouldn't even say he is good at heading

3141~~~
If we have to play him why don't we just stick him at CB? Presumably that's the only reason he plays - because Blind is a midget.

3142~~~
He was one of our best in the first-half, then poorer in the second. Overall I'd say a decent/below average performance. Nothing spectacular (good or bad).

3143~~~
If he played CB he would give a penalty away every game

3144~~~
He's cack, that's not his fault, it's the utter bellend that keeps selecting him. I can't stand Fellaini, he should be nowhere near our club, but the blame lies elsewhere. Also, he's bound to look good at times as every single ball is lumped up to him.

3145~~~
He had an OK first half but was back to Fellaini in the second. We can't continue with this guy. Needs to be moved on, today!

3146~~~
Should have loaned him to Milan and took anything around £9m in the summer. £27m feck me.


One of the worst signings in PL history imo.

3147~~~
I hope he has his finances in control, cause this has been a very bad PR for him. Will take some time to build up his image again somewhere else.

3148~~~
What is wrong with his image?

3149~~~
he had a good first half I thought. 

But if theres any player that sums up United post-fergie its him.

3150~~~
A typical Fellaini performance really. Did something which might have been a red card, won a few headers, chested a few balls, was safe with his passing, wasn't good enough with his defensive duties (Except at set plays where I think he was really good), wasted a good chance. I understood why he was played in the first leg, but I think he shouldn't have played this one.

3151~~~
He was absolutely awful...Let's not make any excuses

That's all

3152~~~
And by being relatively poor in the air. It makes little sense that when you have this physical advantage, you don't have the skills to use it. Andy Carroll is one example among others of tall players who use their aerial ability much better than Fellaini.

3153~~~
Had a really good game. Still have no idea what his actual position is supposed to be, mind. For Van Gaal who is a rigid stickler for positional discipline I have no idea why Fellaini doesn't trigger him severely. Similarly with Blind. Also have to commend his passion for the fight, have to say that I think the entire squad has switched off and look to be going through the motions. What stuck out is that Fellaini didn't seem to care, still got stuck in the entire game. May not have had everything go his way but with absolutely nothing left to play for in your entire MUFC career bar the pride of the shirt, my hat is tipped to him.

Hope he has a decent game on Sunday at the Etihad.

3154~~~
What? He's comfortably a mid table footballer and will mint money easy.

3155~~~
I find those quotes hilarious. It is like some people don't understand what 100k/week means!

3156~~~
I don't understand how someone of his size needs to constantly use his elbows and resort to pushing to win aerial duels. 

Every time i watch us play, i don't understand how he plays 90 minutes, then it hits me that he wasn't even close to our worst player and thats saying a lot.

3157~~~
Literally only in the team to stop us conceding from every set piece or corner we come up against like we were when he was out of team a while back.

Lvg is so reactive...instead of teaching a potentially better team to defend....or buying a player who has more to his game than just defending corners...we have to basically play with  a player less.

3158~~~
You'd think Woodward would get an official wig partner or something for this clown. Make it useful

3159~~~
Wouldn't hold your breath on that happening on Sunday it's been about a year since he had a good game.

He tried last night but he was poor and ineffective as usual and it was incredible he wasn't sent off, no idea how he has only got a yellow card for a deliberate elbow.

3160~~~
At the very least his last good game was against Bournemouth. Last night he wasn't as good as that day but good enough to warrant commendation.

3161~~~
He was ok at Bournemouth but that was about it and he definitely doesn't deserve any commendation last night for his performance, effort is only thing he deserves some credit for. Your bias is clear as you conveniently ignore his most memorable moment in the game which was a deliberate elbow.

3162~~~
We clearly differ in opinion and I guess you can't let it go so good luck to you. For the record, I care not about Fellaini nor his elbows. He can elbow whoever he likes as far as I am concerned and if it is some scouse shithouse or Zabaletta or the Queen Mathilde herself. Could not give less of a toss.

Just calling it as I see it, a bit of fight in the shirt warrants commendation from last night and the last few games that is all I have said. His game against Bournemouth was just a good game of football which deserves praise which answers your question.

3163~~~
Well like I said not had a good game for a year and most memorable thing he did last night was elbow someone in the face, maybe if he had correctly been sent off you would care. If running around a lot without doing much is good enough for you then fair enough but you clearly have low standards.

3164~~~
The Bournemouth game was in December. I think you mean last year.

3165~~~
When judging Fellaini, it's important to understand the kind of player he is.

One thing that he has definitely and conclusively proven in his near-three years at Manchester United, is that he is not a defensive/central midfielder. He isn't going to screen your back four, he isn't going to pass it out of trouble and into space when pressed, he isn't going to win the midfield battle in your own half/at the half way line, and he isn't going to set the tempo. He sometimes plays there but usually ends up fairly further forward and not truly contributing as a CM/DM needs to.

So then what kind of player is he? The the most common answer is that he is a "different option". Alright, so many squads are improved by having a unique option to bring on to unsettle the other team. A player that brings odd attributes to the table that aim to disrupt first and then dominate from thereon. So how does Fellaini? I suppose it's his ability to hold the ball up and bring it out of the air under control. It is a useful option, however,  I would question how often Fellaini has played for us, and how often he has used this "unsettling skillset" of his successfully. For me, it has worked very very rarely, and only against a few of the better teams. That's it. So I question how much this option works, at the outset.

Now, leaving the "surprise" element of Fellaini which works in very are cases aside, if he's not a CM/DM (as mentined earlier) then he is either an AM or a SS or a mix of the two. So let's judge him on the basis of that, and the answer is that he obviously is nowhere near good enough as a starter. He barely ever scores, he's as likely to play a creative through pass as De Gea, he has no pace and he can't dribble either. Squad option as a 10, then? That leaves our squad options as Herrera, Mata, Fellaini and Rooney. I'd argue that this is a poor set of #10s and that we need to trim down and ensure we have true quality and not 4 different but ineffective options.

I'd personally sell.

3166~~~

3167~~~
That was a ridiculous moment.

Thought he played well overall though. The only one to really put himself about.

3168~~~
Sometimes I do feel a bit sorry for the guy. Amid a sea of inconsistent or poor performances, Fellaini often stands out merely because he looks so Fellaini-ish, persisting with that daft hair that makes him look like something created by Sesame Street. Just draws further attention to his ungainly and spotty contributions. He'd be a really central contributor to a team fighting to stay up, but he's not going to ever help the rhythm of a top team, which we certainly aren't yet anyway.

3169~~~
Put himself about, you mean elbowing players ?

3170~~~
Well besides that.

He wasn't great, but better than most of the others out there.

3171~~~
I honestly don't understand why he plays in midfield...

He spent five years at Everton and was highly successful playing much further forward but we've had two clowns who think he's a central midfielder. Clueless.

3172~~~
Against weaker teams I prefer Fellaini in midfield than a pair of holding mids who daren't venture past the halfway line. Against good teams he is one of the only players who shows any sort of passion, fight, aggression etc and isn't just a shrinking violet on the pitch.

3173~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's not an excuse, this has been his level for quite some time.

3174~~~
He never should have been bought and is just another example why we need a DOF.

3175~~~
He really needs to leave, there is just too much animosity towards him now, since he's a real symbol for both Moyes' & LVG's reign.

Even when he has a decent game, people (me included) only see the negatives, it's just not good for any party.

3176~~~
Err... one of those clowns was his manager at Everton.

3177~~~
hopefully he'll be one of the first out of the door when whoever gets to take over comes in.

what i don't understand is that Louie's all been for possession football.  we have better players in our squad than fellaini who can pass a ball but as soon as fellaini is fit LVG seems to abandon his philosophy and get the thug in and whack it up to him

3178~~~
The problem with Fellaini though is that he never ventures past the midfield at the right moment. I noticed it a lot last night. There were times where we'd be mounting an attack, with our four main attackers all in and around the penalty area. Despite presumably being the more advanced of the two midfield options, however, Fellaini was often nowhere to be seen. Instead of lurking on the edge of the area for a stray pass to allow him to get a shot away, he wasn't, well, doing anything. He'd sometimes venture into the picture by the time the ball was out, and the play was dead.

Then, on other times, he'd be standing in someone's else's space in the box at the moment random and unwanted moments. Like, when on particular ball was knocked to Rashford, and Fellaini was essentially obstructing him.

He doesn't really show that much fight or passion, unless passion constitutes elbowing players on the face and nearly getting sent off a lot for it. He works hard...when it suits him. There are so many occasions where he needs to be getting forward or back, but he's just strolling around in midfield, not doing much. A player with fight and aggression would be working hard to link our midfield between attack and defence, while constantly looking to make good challenges/interceptions, and create chances. Fellaini doesn't do that. Can anyone name a series of excellent chances that came about because of him? He certainly wasn't bossing the midfield, or imposing himself upon it either. He just would occasionally receive the ball, and look to shift it off to a better passer beside him.

3179~~~
Can't pass, can't shoot, can't win balls in the air, can't defend. Elbows people. Make of that what you will.

3180~~~
fecking hate when he elbows people. it's like jumping up and elbowing someone is one action for him

3181~~~
Not his fault but he's not good enough for United. Should be sold this summer.

3182~~~
It is a difficult one at times. One thing I noticed was that when we were looking to launch a counterattack and Fellaini was high up the pitch, he would often just allow our attackers to overtake him with the ball and hang back. It is hard to know how much of his positioning/movement is down to instruction from LVG and how much is due to the player.
For my money, I think he is told by LVG to get up the pitch at times to give our defenders/GK a target if they need to make a clearance or play it long. I also think that he knows he isnt the quickest player over 50m so if a fast paced counterattack is on then he deliberately hangs back to allow the faster players to break forward.

This is classic "Fellaini critic" logic, to try to take any sort of strength or quality that Fellaini has and pass it off, twist it or belittle it. You cant really quantify "fight" or "passion" statistically so all I can say is that you must be watching a different game to me if you dont think that Fellaini imposes himself on the midfield and doesnt inject some aggression, physicality, grit and determination into our team - qualities which I feel are sorely lacking in the majority of the squad.

3183~~~
No he wasn't! Remember Tim Cahill, the smaller yet technically superior, better at heading and making things happen? That was the successful one. Fellaini's time at Everton is way too overrated.

3184~~~
Mate, I think you are the classic example of a Fellaini "overrater" in context of your comment. I want to take you to the early years of Darren Fletcher and Darron Gibson before the former became the Fletcher we have come to adore. At that time, they weren't even as technically deficient as Fellaini currently but one thing they could not be accused of was not been hard workers on the pitch. When those two went off the pitch you know they left something behind. I agree that our whole team lacks that passion, aggression, physicality, grit and determination but to say that Fellaini shows it is just laughable with all due respect. I'd rather have Gibson or Fletcher instead of the lump that is Fellaini is we are talking about aggression and determination.

3185~~~
Again though, I'm failing to see this passion/fight. He usually lumbers around the pitch for most of a game, occasionally with a burst of energy when he feels like it. He's not a leader who drives us forward. He isn't constantly coming in with crucial tackles or interceptions at the most unexpected moment. He isn't bursting a gut to get from end to end. So, apart from being big and strong, <i>how </i>does he impose himself upon the game? I'm just not seeing it. Hell, the stats from against West Ham demonstrate my point...Fellaini was generally on the ball less than most players, gave it away a lot, and wasn't making interceptions or tackles. So, where is this fight? Phrases like "grit" and "determination" feel like buzzwords, because I'm not seeing them at all. I don't see any more determination in him than I do in players like Carrick or Schweinsteiger.

3186~~~
Problem is, it's not ice hockey Utd play. We don't need an 'enforcer' that can only elbow. We need someone with grit, but can also play football.
He's not hard, he's cynical. Never goes in hard for 50/50 tackles, would rather elbow someone on the sly. 

He's far from the only problem Utd have, but he's a stand out symbol of how bad we've become. If anyone thinks he's good enough for Utd, just ask yourself if he would make it into any elite European team? As for this 'do a job' ideology about him... That doesn't wash, this is Man Utd. Being tall shouldn't be a qualification for playing for Utd, but that Dutch fool with the notepad seems to think so.

Really hope both their tenures at Utd are coming to an end.

3187~~~
The twisted thing is he plays the small-ish and lightweight Blind as a CB for his passing - and then plays Fellaini in midfield for his height. Most managers would play, y'know, an actual CB in defence and people who can play football in midfield.

3188~~~
Should pursue another sport like basketball or just McDonald's birthday party mascott.

He had full three years to prove something and he doesn't even have a one stable role on the pitch. Seriously like what the flying f*ck... He's 28 years old and managers still don't have a clue how to properly use him on the pitch.

What's the point of keeping someone like that in the club which got way more bigger ambitions than endlessly accommodating an experienced player on a same wages level as Michael Carrick ? Somebody needs to clean up that mess or just sell him to another club that will have plenty of new problems to deal with.

3189~~~
Even I as one of Fellaini's most outspoken supporters on here dont thing he <i>should</i> be first choice for United in an ideal world. I have written extensively on the topic that we should have signed at least one other midfielder in the summer that we got Fellaini (and that this is <i>part</i> of the reason why the supporters inherently dislike him).

As things stand in the here and now and with the players that we have though, he is pretty much the only one of our midfielders who can provide the qualities you mentioned for the team. Furthermore, the fact that we have Blind at CB who is by no means physically imposing, I think that LVG feels that he needs Fellaini in the team to counterbalance that (and I dont disagree with him on that tbf) - the set piece goals we have conceded when Fellaini hasn't been on the pitch likely only reinforce LVGs stance in that regard.

As I said before, passion/fight/call it what you want isnt really something that anyone can statistically measure. Passion is in the eye of the beholder, so to speak. What I do think is beyond doubt is that Fellaini has proven himself to have a certain mental fortitude, if based upon nothing other than his form last season after a) nearly being sold and b) being boo'd in pre-season by our own fans. He has always been someone who will keep their chin up when the chips are down - you could even argue that his current situation with supporters cheering him being substituted etc is further evidence that he doesnt simply curl up into a shell when the going gets tough.

I know this post will be met with a response of "but is that enough to merit a place in the United starting XI?" and the answer is obviously no, but I feel that you need to have at least some players in the team who dont back down from a fight, especially in some of the more heated games in the PL. Additionally there is the simple difference in opinion on Fellaini's technical abilities, which I think are constantly underrated on here (which isnt to say that he is some sort of midfield maestro, but simply that he isnt anything like as bad as people make out).

The notion that all Fellaini does is wander around the pitch elbowing people is not one that I agree with, but I doubt anything I say will change your mind about that so I wont bother.

3190~~~
This is my contention as with many other fans. You say he can but he doesn't at all. 3 years at United and I don't a Fellaini that has this so called attributes. The guy is big and limp. For a player that has 8 years PL experience at 28 years old, the guy is a sham. Have we not conceeded goals when he as been on the pitch. This is the same that hardly wins headers. That is just a myth friend.

3191~~~
Well then we appear to have reached an impasse.

3192~~~
He offers a different way to get the ball up the pitch and he is good at it. We are not good at playing out of the back so having the option of passing Fellaini high up the pitch Means we can move the ball out faster.
Also his presence alone give us something which none of Herrera/Carrick/Schneiderlin provides. He is a good player to have in your squad imo, but it seems he will always be Associated with our decline as long as he stays here.

3193~~~
Sadly, I'm sure there are other things that we may agree upon <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3194~~~
Still don't look at him as a United player and never will.

Consider our central midfielders for the last 20 years and then look at this guy.  Djemba-Djemba was fecking Roy Keane compared to this guy.

Awful, awful player.

3195~~~
Eh... Ok then.

Wins 48% of aerial duels. Currently ranked 42nd in the list of premier footballers winning headers. Staggering.

3196~~~
You are right, it is intangible and it will be a subjective view for each fan of United. There will be many who just think he is a clown and will never see it. I still think the fact that despite being booed and jeered by his own fans and then on numerous occasions afterwards giving a solid shift for nothing more than the shirt is something to be commended. Even if he is a bit of a crap footballer and struggling to show his worth to the team. He has looked at times this season like he is the only one that gives a shit about what is happening and isn't in 'im rich biach' cruise control mode.

Honestly, you're just waffling a bunch of words here. None of this even makes a lick of sense. Definitive "he can't provide anything cause' he is shite" proclamations when he's had good games for us before, "I don't a Fellaini that has this so called attributes" you aren't even stringing proper sentences together. "A sham" and "big and limp" honestly if you're going to debate something at least speak a bit of substance on the matter.

3197~~~
The good thing with him is he could be very useful in the right set up so could potentially fetch £15m+.

I guess the most relevant question maybe will Mourinho see a use for him?

3198~~~
What do you want? A gold star on your English report?

3199~~~
We've got three very much box to box midfielders in their own right and a manager who prefers positional discipline and ball recycling over movement. I personally think that his position in the squad is untenable now that the fans have piped up and I think it would be best for all parties if he move on. But if he stays since he's under contract I could see another manager getting something out of him providing we set up to allow box to box midfielders to operate either in a three with a defensive midfielder at the base or as a hybrid #10/#8.

3200~~~
He did have his best run of form for us in the diamond I think you are describing, last season when we beat spurs/liverpool/city. He seemed to get found out pretty quickly though.

His best position is definitely number 10 but it encourages a brand of football we shouldn't really be aspiring to.

3201~~~
Retire you cnut!

3202~~~
No club will pay that much for him after the last three seasons. 

Even we shouldn't have paid that much, mind you. Let alone 27M. Too late now of course.

3203~~~
He's getting paid for it, too. It's his job, you know.

3204~~~
If reports are to be believed, didn't the club turn down anything less than £24m in January? Then again it's the new United!

3205~~~
A club like Sunderland may well shell out £10 million or so. He'd do well for them and it's about his level.

3206~~~
Odd inclusion for a feature on Football focus today. Clearly his PR people arranged it.

Must have said "I'm not dirty I just protect myself" about 20 times.
Bizarre

3207~~~
Never read anything on here until today, it really does emphasize how far United have fallen when people consistently seem to think Fellaini is playing ok/decent/good in CM.

Expectations have just sunk so low and in general our whole squad almost to a man are so average that people aren't able to see how bad he is actually playing right now.

Of course a lot of it is down to Van Gaal continually playing him in there when he isn't really a proper midfielder.

3208~~~
Sums up how i feel also. Soul destroying to see him in the starting line-up as we rarely win when he plays.

3209~~~
Fellaini is a constant reminder of how far United have fallen after Fergie. I'd have thought a manager with LVG's experience would see through his mediocrity and get rid.

3210~~~
The 4-3-3 when Herrera was playing as an #8 and Fellaini was playing as a sort of #810ish player. At the end of the day there is about 6 players in our squad where you can say "he needs the freedom and to have the system allow him freedom for it to work" and you can roll the dice and pick one. Mata, Rooney, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger. There really isn't a proper combination in the lot of midfield and attacking midfield options we possess.

I think that 4-3-3 when we were forced to had Carrick at the base and it allowed Fellaini and Herrera the freedom. Schweinsteiger is not mobile enough and Schneiderlin is not a good enough passer of the ball. The whole thing is a bit of a soupy mess of players who don't really work with each other as a 2DM imo. Even Herrera-Schneiderlin was a bit up and down.

These types of comments keep popping up and they just mean absolutely sod all. You could say that about plenty of players for is. "Rooney just epitomizes how far we've fallen after Fergie", "Getting rid of 5 young Mancs before they got a shot and then literally having no players to play epitomizes how far we've fallen after Fergie", "Daley Blind starting 45 games at CB for a top club epitomizes how far we've fallen after Fergie", "Signing Schweinsteiger and expecting him to be more than a bit part experience player guiding the squad epitomizes how far we've fallen after Fergie".

It's just silly waffle that adds nothing to the discussion.

3211~~~
I don't really think his form last season showed <i>that </i>great a mental fortitude, though. He went from being awful to quite decent, with an admittedly excellent spell which came at a time when we were playing some of our best football since Fergie left.

Like...it was good and that, but I don't think it was anything spectacular. Any criticism he received was comparatively minor to the worst abuses a footballer can receive (seriously, a few boos is <i>nothing </i>compared to what can happen to some players), and he was still playing for a massive club with what I'm going to guess is a very comfortable wage. I mean, yeah...it was decent and all, but I don't think it was anything remarkable. I don't think it was any better than Smalling stepping up after years of doubt and becoming our main defender. And it's certainly not as massive as Rashford being thrown into the team and scoring two braces, or Martial essentially being our main attacking outlet despite still being an inexperienced teenager.

His mental fortitude, or whatever we'll call it, is...well, fine. But I don't think having a good season after a really poor one shows magnificent character. It's decent, yeah. But nothing brilliant, that isn't done on a regular basis.

And, again, on the pitch, I don't see any of this supposed fashion. He lumbers about, with occasional bursts of energy when he feels like it at either end of the pitch. I genuinely just don't see the argument for him being this passion-filled, resilient character. He's not. Or, if he is, he's no more so than other players in our team. It just feels like an excuse for him being a bit rubbish for us when it comes to actually playing football, used because he's big and physical...the type of players who are often stereotypically tagged as being full of <i>fight </i>or <i>passion</i>.

3212~~~
His best game in a while today. Should just keep doing the same thing.

3213~~~
Finally, LVG finds Fellaini's best position.

3214~~~
We start the game without Fellaini and win i like it.

3215~~~
I thought he was awesome today 10/10

3216~~~
We are a better team without him, simple as that.

3217~~~
motm for me.

3218~~~
Exactly. He may put in a decent individual performance at times but he brings others around him down.

3219~~~
Did you hear the crowd when he got up to come on. The City fans cheered him loudly then Darmian went down and they booed, the gaff got out into the technical area then sat him down and the crowd booed again really loud. Lol, poor guy getting dogs abuse from all angles. Glad he didn't play today, probably best to wait for the animosity to die down a bit and I prefer Schneiderlin in midfield myself anyway.

3220~~~
Yeah definitely I think he is difficult to play with and doesn't fit in with the other players, all our other midfielders look worse playing with him. He was better at Everton because they were set up to play to his strengths, it's no coincidence our results are worse when he plays.

3221~~~
And I think thats because when hes on the pitch, its all played to his strengths to make him look good (more longer balls, etc) but it just doesnt suit anybody else around him. We play much better without him. We have a better record without him. We went on a nice little run without him and as soon as he was fit, he was put back in and we went to poo again.

3222~~~
He has naked pictures of LVG.

3223~~~
Yep everyone but LVG notices that it seems.

3224~~~
– United’s record (all competitions) this season when Fellaini starts: P18, W6, D6, L6.
– United’s record (all competitions) this season when Fellaini doesn’t start: P29, W16, D7, L6.

3225~~~
Feck me.  I know win/loss records when certain players play can be misleading, but that's pretty damning.  We're clearly a better team without.

3226~~~
Wow!
LVG is just a terrible terrible coach for continually starting him, and always in the cm position no less.

3227~~~
Was fantastic today. More of the same please

3228~~~
Felliani is UTTER shit though. Those other players you mentioned are not

3229~~~
Give the man a break - we was massive for us at times last season after taking a lot of heat under Moyes. He earned at least a warm farewell from us.

3230~~~
I'll be elated when he leaves and i'll try my best to refrain from being too harsh.

3231~~~
UTTER.

It is clearly coincidental. For example in the league, with Blind and De Gea in the team we've P30, W14, D8 and L8. Those are horrible numbers, completely coincidental with the fact that they've played pretty much every game.

3232~~~
No & no. He was less crap for us a few times last year. He's earned nothing from us except the millions Utd have been paying him to be less-than-competent. I genuinely think we could have got a tall non-league player who would have been more effective over the past 3 seasons. He's the worst player in my living memory to wear a Utd jersey.

3233~~~
It's not his fault that he was recruited for a job he couldn't do. Moyes should've  know that Fellaini was always going to be a square peg in a round hole.

3234~~~
He did score some very crucial goals for us coming on as a sub, and was very handy against Arsenal.

3235~~~
Irrespective of whether or not it's his "fault".... He is a terrible footballer.

3236~~~
He scored a few goals... And you cite one game in 3 years when he was handy.

A broken clock is correct twice a day.

3237~~~
So you're saying that we shouldn't criticize bad players at all?

3238~~~
Moyes is incredible. Sign a player every man and his dog knew we shouldn't have signed then refuse to play him in his best position because of what people might say.

3239~~~
I would hope that's it now for Fellaini in a Utd shirt. 

We just play better without him. He might be the first Utd signing I remember where everyone knew he would be shite, said he would be shite and then he was shite.  The fans knew better than the club.

3240~~~
More like a digital clock with a frozen screen, then it's correct once a day <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3241~~~
can they afford his salary?

3242~~~
Well we just aren't that good a side right now and as you say they have played every game so you can't really glean anything from the sides w/d/l ratio that would indicate whether those two are a positive/negative to the side

But our stats with and without Fellaini starting shows a stark contrast in the teams fortunes whenever he plays. To argue otherwise is silly.

3243~~~
attack is the best form of defense

3244~~~
I just don't <i>get</i> Fellaini.

3245~~~
So half the games we have won when starting Fellaini have been against teams in either the championship or league one?

3246~~~
Correct Ipswich, Sheffield United and Derby. The other 3 being 2x against Liverpool and 1x vs Stoke.

Here's a breakdown of our stats in all comps with and without Fello starting.

Without Felllaini:---------------------With Fellaini:
P - 30--------------------------------P - 18
W - 17 = 56.6%---------------------W - 06 = 33.3%
D -  07 = 23.3%---------------------D - 06 = 33.3%
L -  06 = 20.0%----------------------L - 06 = 33.3%

Our record in the games where he starts is the very definition of bang average, if he started every game we would probably be 12-13th going off those numbers.

3247~~~
And the worry? he does not really praise morgan, but when fellaini was playing VG could not wait to praise how well he played, one of many reasons why VG is the wrong man for the job. We will see next game if VG cannot help himself, and shoehorn this clumsey idiot again in our starting 11

3248~~~
Fellaini does have a purpose, which i admit is easy to forget at times. 

He's a bit like a bog brush, in the sense that he's shit and that he's only good at one thing. If you try using a bog brush to wash the kitchen sink, you're in for a nightmare, if you try using it as a walking stick, you'll struggle, if you try using it as a deodorant, you're in for a treat. It's only good for one thing, and when there is no need for that spesific task it's easy to forget that it even exists. Until you use it, and you think "there really should be a better way of doing this". Which coincidentally is how the majority feels when they watch Fellaini play, "There really should be a better way"

Fellaini reckons he's a defensive midfielder, which is pretty much a bog brush in denial thinking it's a beautiful rose. He's not a defensive midfielder. It's far more likely that he doesn't understand what defensive means, and that if you ask him, he'll elbow you in the throat.

3249~~~
Harsh on Sunderland that....

3250~~~
When we went on a good run with him in the team last year, he was played in a target role further up the pitch. He was able to get the ball down in tight spots in the final third and move the ball on.

This year for some strange reason, LvG is starting him in a CM role where he is expected to pick the ball up off the defense and link the midfield to attack. Clearly he doesn't have the ability to do this and he makes whoever his unlucky CM partner for the day is look terrible too.

I'm not defending him, but he is being asked to play a role he doesn't have the ability to play. It's clear for the fans to see, but stubborn LvG continues to persist, even though the evidence points towards it being a massive mistake.

Hopefully we move him on in the summer.

3251~~~
Fellaini's good run is being glorified like it was the holy grail of good runs, it's slightly bizarre.

Was he good, yes. Was he superb, no. It was just a surprise that he went from utter shit to good.

The other teams had no plan for him, a bit like the infamous match against us which he is still remembered for, when we allowed him to roam between midfield and defence and unchallenged he kept chesting the ball down and caused us huge problems. 

We then played Chelsea, who nullified him with ease, and he then went off to be complete shite for the rest of the season, with the added bonus of an insanely daft red card.

3252~~~
The fabled "good run" is brought up far more by the critics than the supporters of Fellaini at this point. It is the latest flavour-of-the-month much like "<i>he isnt actually that good in the air</i>" was last month.

3253~~~
No. I am saying the criticism should take the players ability into account.

3254~~~
Who would have thought two years after Moyes' departure that Fellaini will still be one of the most discussed players on the forum...

3255~~~
He was consistently decent over the course of the season to be fair, although his excellent run did happen to come at a time when we were playing our best football in a while as a team. It was a bit like Cleverley and Anderson's early 2011/2012 runs of form. Excellent for a while, but soon faded away.

Well, he's <i>not </i>that good in the air, in all fairness. He doesn't score/create chances anywhere near often enough, loses a surprising number of aerial duels, and is only consistently good at defensive set-pieces because he's taller than other players, meaning it's easier for him to make contact with the ball. His technique/aim from headers is average.

3256~~~
To try and extrapolate some form of conclusion out of those stats is equally silly. They mean nothing.

3257~~~
Using the stats on their own perhaps not i would be inclined to agree, but all these stats are providing is statistical evidence to confirm what the majority of United fans already think  from watching United's performances this season when Fellaini starts in CM. Which he has done for the majority of his games this season.

Whenever he starts in there we are a worse side, we can all see it even if we don't all want to admit it yet. He offers little if anything in attack, slows down play and abandons his midfield partner and leaves our midfield wide open to be overran.

In that context when you then look at these stats, well they paint a picture.

Without Felllaini:---------------------With Fellaini:
P - 30--------------------------------P - 18
W - 17 = 56.6%---------------------W - 06 = 33.3%
D - 07 = 23.3%---------------------D - 06 = 33.3%
L - 06 = 20.0%----------------------L - 06 = 33.3%

For whats its worth last season whenever he played in the side further up the pitch in his more natural position (which he did for the most part) i thought we were a better side with him than without and i'd bet the same sort of stats would back that up.

Edit: Heres the same stats from last season.

With Fellaini:-------------------------Without Fellaini:
P - 23--------------------------------P - 21 
W - 14 = 60%-----------------------W - 09 = 42%
D - 03 = 13%------------------------D - 08 = 38%

Are you Lord Byron? Great post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3259~~~
Louis van Gaal is not using “very good” Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini correctly, according to Belgium coach Marc Wilmots.

Fellaini’s performances have come under heavy criticism from United supporters this season, but Wilmots believes he has been hamstrung by Louis van Gaal’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation.

Fellaini himself has previously said he sees himself as a defensive midfielder, but Wilmots says the 28-year-old is better without a partner in the deep role. Wilmots believes the former Everton man’s best position, however, is as a box-to-box midfielder.


“I know him by heart,” Wilmots told The Times. “In my eyes, he is a box-to-box [midfielder]. He could also play as No. 6 by himself, but not with a partner.

“He has the ability to play on the offensive too, as Everton used him. He is the best goal scorer I have. He is a very good player with a unique profile, but he is a player who must be used taking his qualities into account.”

3260~~~
Fellaini says #6
Wilmots says #8
Moyes says #10
LvG says #9

I say Left Back, left back on the bench!

3261~~~
The position Van Gaal played him at the back end of last season is the position i'd play him. He was excellent and unplayable at the time.

3262~~~
Whenever (and wherever) he played for Everton he was an absolute menace to play against.

I don't know exactly what that position was, but I feel we can get more out of him and utilise him better.

One thing I do know, is that he's clearly not suited to play in a central midfield pairing. 

In an age where footballers have to be flexible (in terms of positions they can play and styles), he is very one dimensional, but he does have some useful qualities.

3263~~~
It was a very short time

3264~~~
Not really.

He was a menace against us for one match.

3265~~~
I wonder if we will talk about it next season too.

3266~~~
Except that after maybe 3 games of him playing well in that position Mourinho realised that all you have to do is stick a mediocre centre back on him and not only does he become useless, but the entire tactics that playing him is based around become useless to.

3267~~~
Sorry, but that's simply not true.

3268~~~
I remember him doing big damage against us in that 4-4 game and when we lost 0-1 to Everton in the first game of the following season. So much, that Fergie put Jones to man mark him when we beat Everton 2-0 later on.

3269~~~
You must feel sorry for Belgium.

3270~~~
The only thing he's bringing us right now is defensive headers. With Blind injured (FFS) perhaps we'll have 2 centre backs in there that can do their jobs, and not need a dedicated corner clearer in central midfield. 

He's awful at CM, we play awful with him at CM and it really is that simple. 

He should be a last 25 minutes optino when we're losing, should stick at the edge of the area and create havoc. That's all he's good for, and he's good at that. LVG's misuse of him is astonishing.

3271~~~
I honestly believe if he starts any game between now and the end of the season, it puts a huge dent in our ambitions to finish top 4.

3272~~~
He must have dirt on Wilmots too.

3273~~~
I feel sorry for Lukaku and Benteke

3274~~~
Correct. Along with Herrera and Schniederlin who are both predominantly box to box players who operate in the space rather than in the position.

Correct. I've seen him play well as a anchor style #6 under Martinez before his transfer to United and for Moyes for a consistent spell. But he never played as part of a midfield two, more as the base of a three (or the a central role dropping off if ever in a two). After those two seasons under Moyes he played that Tim Cahill style withdrawn forward role in which he scored a healthy but not extortionate amount of goals and showed some goal scoring worth.

I think if we had have stayed playing 4-3-3 we might have got some more worth out of him post-injury at the start of the season. But then Young or Memphis would have been bumped out of the side and he certainly wasn't worth the first choice or system change going into the season coming off an injury. He's had a handful of decent to admirable performances in the variety of roles we have used him in this season but playing him as a forward was definitely awful. He's not a striker and can't hold the ball up when it is humped at him, he's better off in the space or free with an all-round role.

3275~~~
Ehh No. He was a menace a lot of times against many teams. He was Everton's key player

3276~~~
wat

3277~~~
Lukaku -   12 goals in 47 appearances. <b>25.5%</b>. 1 goal every 202 minutes. 
Benteke -  9 goals in 31 appearances. <b>29%</b>. 1 goal every 228 minutes. 
Fellaini -   15 goals in 67 appearances. <b>22.4%</b>. 1 goal every 343 minutes. 

Clearly Wilmots has been dabbling in Van Gaal's hazy dutch stash.

3278~~~
He is correct I think. Fellaini with 15 international goals and good amount in the qualifiers is the top scorer in the entire team

3279~~~
Moot point. Rooney is England's top scorer of all time... but he isn't even the best striker in the team.

3280~~~
Against us ? Yes, it is...

3281~~~
As the RDevil says above, iirc he was their top scorer in the qualifiers or in 2015.

3282~~~
Which part about "against us" did you fail to understand ?

3283~~~
On the contrary Fellaini did those goals recently in qualifiers I believe. I am not saying Fellaini is their best chance at scoring, but their coach's words are not entirely wrong

3284~~~
I never said just against us. 

Even if I did say that though, it's still not true.

3285~~~
I said against us.

And yes, it's true.

3286~~~
Again, I never said only against us, so I'm not sure why you're trying to argue that point when it wasn't my point in the first place.

Also, you're wrong, but I'm not going to go out of my way to prove it to you.

Fellaini at Everton was a menace for many teams in the league, that's not even up for debate.

3287~~~
It's not really complicated. 


. Unless you have absolutely no concept of "whenever and wherever", it's a valid reply that he's only had one match against us where he was a menace, so your point about whenever and wherever is clearly incorrect.

3288~~~
You're something else.

Do you have to take the post so literally? Of course I'm not saying he was excellent in every game he's ever played in his life, but I thought that was obvious, clearly not.

My point is that Fellaini was more often than not an absolute handful to play against whilst at Everton, not just against us, but many teams in the league.

Are you disagreeing with that point? or were you just being anal about the 'whenever (and wherever)' part?

3289~~~
So now your issue is that your comment was taken seriously.

What about this comment of yours, is this supposed to be taken seriously, or not literally at all

3290~~~
Nah he was only ever a handful to play against when Everton moved him further forward and basically built the team around him.

He was ok in midfield for them at times but his best spells for them were when he was deployed in basically a free target man role in between the midfield and striker. It's basically the only position he's any real use in. He doesn't have the positional sense or the passing range to play anywhere else in midfield to a high level in a good side.

3291~~~
If only Belgium could draw on your knowledge

3292~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3293~~~
I remember at least 2. The 4-4 draw towards the end of 11/12, and the 1-0 away defeat on the opening day of 12/13. He was toying with us in both games.

3294~~~
He gave us problems in the 1-0 win against a makeshift defence. Carrick couldn't handle him in the air simples.

3295~~~
And that was basically the box to box that Wilmots talks about - #8 or #10 in a 4-3-3 with one DM

Even against Liverpool the other day he was one of our best players in the first half playing the more advanced midfield role - Klopp obviously realised it and put 2 players on him in the second half to completely nullify his threat.
He's not so good playing in a midfield two though, but neither is he as bad as some make out.

3296~~~
Will never shake off being the first Moyes signing for starters, and then being criminally limited for a club at the level we're looking to compete at.

The biggest question of Moyes, is that he knew exactly what Fellaini was about, but didn't play him where he'd best used him for Everton.
Not to mention all that fuss about how the first signing had to be a key one, ending with just Fellaini to show for a summer of almost championship manager who can be buy fantasy!

3297~~~
Rio and Evans didn't handle him any better in the 4-4 draw, worse infact, so a full strength defence wouldn't have really made a difference. He dominated both centre backs at their place, Vidic included. The majority of times he had the beating of Carrick was when the ball was on the ground.

He was much more than a battering ram that day anyway. He kept drifting wide left like he did for us last season, and he was causing problems for anyone who came near him. Him and Pienaar were running circles around Valencia, Cleverley and Nani down our right.



He's been predominantly awful this season, but that now seems to have rewritten history and that he has always been awful. It's just not true.

3298~~~
Lolz.. It was not about knowledge. Fellaini had one of his best years for the NT last year. Hence the coach's comment makes a bit of sense.
Anyways with Hazard looking suddenly gone the likes of Fellaini scoring along with Lukaku maybe is their best chance at going somewhere in the Euros.

3299~~~
So the point you were making was that the 2-3 times we faced Everton with Fellaini he was only once unplayable? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Again with the rewriting of history. I don't see what people get out of this. Fellaini when on form is unplayable at what he does. Just because he's been playing crap right now wont change that. 

During that run of his he was brilliant. Not just "good". If you think that, you have an agenda against him.

3300~~~
I am not sure what your definition of "to a high level in a good side is". If you mean a side like Manchester United, then you might be right but if you are talking about a side like Everton, Fellaini had pretty good days in Midfield (I recall him starting there against Arsenal and did pretty well). I personally don't recall him being absolutely destructive in midfield so I guess his best position is a bit further forward.

3301~~~
He was a very good player for Everton. I had him in my fantasy team in 12/13 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>. 

Schneiderlin was a very good player for Southampton. 
Ashley Young was a very good player for Villa (when they were top 8 quality)

You get the drift. Players from lower down the table can still be one of the best performers over the league season but there are factors that have to be taken into consideration. For instance with Fellaini, that Everton team had peak Baines and Coleman down the flanks with Mirallas and Pienaar drifting inwards. Everyone dovetailed beautifully and Fellaini with his skill-set benefited most. Put him in a team where he simply isn't good enough to be given a roaming role regularly then you see his limitations come through. It works from time to time but there are better players than him who should be given the opportunity to grow into the role because they've got more quality.

3302~~~
Can you honestly say that he's generally done well since his move? Considering what he cost and what he's brought to the team he's been a colossal flop

3303~~~
No, I don't think he has, bar a handful of games last season, where he was very effective. Other than perhaps 7 or 8 games, he's not been good.

That wasn't what my post was about though, or what the discussion over the last couple of pages was about. His tragic form this season seems to have deleted all trace of him ever being a good player, according to many here. 

He was a very good, very effective player at Everton. He was a tough customer in a lot of big games for them before we signed him. He gave us a few very difficult games. One of them single-handedly ripped the title off out of our hands. His unpopularity here currently is rewriting history.

3304~~~
All of his best games for us were last season and for a while he actually was looking an important player for us, which at the time was hilarious...

Wilmots is right though, it was when he was given a more free role on the midfield that he showed his best

This season for whatever reason, maybe He has also been "van Galled" it just hasn't happened 

It will be very interesting to see what Jose thinks of him. Will he be first out the door or will he see something he likes in him?

3305~~~
Jose won't keep him as a starter, but I can see him keeping him to do a similar job to what Mikel did under him. Come on and be a physical presence to try and close out narrow leads.

3306~~~
He's nowhere near good enough for that. Mikel isn't the best player to grace the Premiership, but he's the perfect destroyer and has a habit of getting away with plenty of fouls.

Fellaini on the other hand has almost zero defensive positional awareness, is completely conspicuous with his fouls, tends to make more brutish tackles rather than the cynical ones that Mikel makes and probably is even worse on the ball.

3307~~~
Yeah for a run of the mill defensive mid table side like Everton were he can sit in there and push his weight around and use his physicality he can be alright in midfield. I don't remember him having any particularly outstanding games in there for them. All his best games that i can remember were further forward.

He for me is one of those niche players that doesn't really have an actual position, he does need a free role with no midfield responsibilities to get the best out of him. Problem for United is to get the best out of Fellaini we have to basically change the way we play. And it's just not worth it for what he brings to the table.

3308~~~
not any good. sell him

3309~~~
Another awesome, card free, elbow free performance from him today. Keep it going Fellaini!

3310~~~
Yeah another master class from him today, I think the position he played today and against City is where we get the best out of him.

3311~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Watch him start against Spurs now.

3312~~~
ffs, don't go putting ideas into LVG's head.

3313~~~
I don't see the problem.

Either he's extremely rarely on form or he's not really unplayable at what he does (whatever that is). And no, he wasn't brilliant. Either you have a very special definition of brilliance that only counts for Fellaini, or you surely have a hard on for him if you reckon that was a string of brilliant performances by the human bog brush. It's not really rewriting history. Unless you happened to grow up in chernobyl in the late 80's, Fellainis amount of great matches can be counted on one hand. We went on a run which, considering the opposition, was a surprise. We dominated Tottenham, won against Liverpool, dominated Villa and managed an impressive comeback against City where we won 4-2 and Fellaini was yet again impressive. 

Then Mourinho stuck Zouma on him to prevent Fellaini from roaming freely, and he was completely nullified. We then went on to get battered by Everton, in a match where Fellaini was so fecking useless he got subbed off at half time. Back in the starting lineup to be useless against WBA, scored a crucial goal against Palace, useless against Arsenal, sent off against Hull after 18 mins on the pitch.

Some reckons he's a hard man, but somehow he managed to look utter clueless against Arsenal, the biggest fannies out there. Kudos.

3314~~~
In fairness, he had a good run earlier in that season too, including games against, ironically, Chelsea and WBA among others. I certainly wouldn't say he's brilliant though. Maybe he'll score a few goals against Ireland or someone at the Euros and get a confidence boost like after the World Cup.

3315~~~
Unsurprising, the usual suspects. Nothing to see here.

3316~~~
But this never happened in history!!!

3317~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3318~~~
Yesterday was one of Fellaini's best performances. I hope he continues playing in that role

3319~~~
I agree. In that role, Fellaini won't need to be the main defensive outlet in midfield (he lacks the positioning, discipline and pace to do that role) and he wouldn't be the main creative outlet either (he lacks football brain, technique and passing skills to do that). He will be free to run around, elbow the occasional player and head the ball to his heart consent.

However we should be asking whether its wise to play a player as box to box midfielder because of his weaknesses rather then his strengths? Why should we stick to Fellaini when we can get Gundogan whose perfectly suited for the role and would be an asset to the team? In my opinion we've got two players who are more suited for the box to box midfielder's role than Fellaini (Bastian and Blind).

3320~~~
Heavy involved in that goal with the build up and finish. Good performance today in general. Fair play to him.

3321~~~
In the team for his aerial presence and decided to use his foot to clear a high ball from a corner. Fecking genius, son.

3322~~~
Because he could have got his head to that?

3323~~~
I thought he had a solid game in terms of his overall play and grabbed a vital goal, we should get a decent price in the summer.

3324~~~
Thought he had a pretty good game, fair play. Still should be sold this summer.

3325~~~
I think Mourinho would like to have him in the squad.

3326~~~
Man of the match for me

3327~~~
So Fellaini starts and we win the game, in arguably our biggest game of the season, where he was arguably our best player. You go Fellaini! <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3328~~~
Love how silent this thread is now. And then people say they don't have an agenda, they're just telling it how it is. So why aren't the same amount of people telling it how it is today?

3329~~~
This

3330~~~
he was fresh and battled well, loved the little run through the middle in the first half, west ham players be like "oh this is fellaini, no need to press him he will pass it or stumbles anyway". Yeah and he scored his classic scrappy goal but after initial nice work... Can only say well done to him and the manager, looked like a good decision to play him... I just dont like the games when he's off his mind and always gets to the ball second, after games like this I always feel he might still be usefull in the future

3331~~~
Was pretty good today. Fair play to Fellaini. Had a few nice surging runs from deep too.

3332~~~
One match doesn't change judgement based on 3 years in United.

Call it agenda, I don't give a f*ck. I can always call you paranoid.

3333~~~
Good game from Marouane, credit where it's due.

3334~~~
Oh dear

3335~~~
Care to elaborate?

3336~~~
That really depends on whether the match in question is a good or bad one, in here.

3337~~~
Even the sun shines on a dogs are some days.

3338~~~
he played like he cared. Which is more than what carrick and herrera did frankly. He could have easily not cared and screwed up but still seems to want to show that he can be good. I respect him for that.

3339~~~
Played pretty well today. Got the bit of luck for the goal that he deserved for getting into the right position. Fair play to ya Fellaini.

3340~~~
Three seasons is enough for me.

Still a very good game from him today. Let's be honest, LvG owes him a car.

3341~~~
He does tend to have decent games when he plays, but the problem normally is the rest of the team doesnt and United dont tend to have good games.

What has helped him however is it seemed like we played 433 today rather than 4231 (which has seen the best of him last season).

3342~~~
Good game tonight. Got in some good positions and actually moved us forward quickly on occasion when we won the ball.

3343~~~
Played well, but really annoys me how he doesn't even look at the target when he gets a shot on goal. It's something that the coaching team should have sorted out ages ago.

3344~~~
Was a good performance from him as mentioned, made some good runs.

3345~~~
That was the type of performance he was putting in during last season's run-in. The system and shape of the team certainly helped him.

3346~~~
Played well tonight and got the winner fair play to him.

He is much more effective in the sort of free role he had tonight rather than in a midfield two alongside Carrick or Schneiderlin.

3347~~~
Did well.

3348~~~
Have to agree with the general census, he was very good tonight. He sprinted back nearly 40 yards at one stage trying to win the ball back, it was refreshing to see.

3349~~~
Thought he was awful. Worst player on the pitch

<span style="color: #ffffff">Didn't see the game. Go on Shamans, bite!  :-)</span>

3350~~~
The 4-3-3 system suits him better. It probably suits most of our midfielders actually, no idea why we don't play it more often.

3351~~~
He's rubbish, sell him <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3352~~~
Chuffed for him, sounded like he had a blinder. Got himself a very neat goal with a good tap-in. No idea why we insist on playing two DM's and a 10 when we have 4 B2B players at the club. (Herrera, Fellaini, Schniederlin and Bastian). Seems pretty stupid to come to terms with, 50 odd games into a shocker of a season.

3353~~~
he actually dribbled forward with the ball from central midfield and put himself about! Forgotten what that's like watching Schneiderlin and Carrick so much. Happy that he can play a role for us, would still sell though!

3354~~~
One of our better players yesterday.

When will LVG realise that for him to be effective he has to be played further up-field?

Instead he persists with him at defensive midfield, when every man and his dog can see he does not have the skill set to fulfil that role.

When Herrera stepped back and Fellaini moved forward, that is when we were at our most dangerous. He can win balls in the final third and provide opportunities for Rashford and Martial to run on to. That's how he was such a huge success at Everton.

3355~~~
He wasn't all that in the first half, but much better in the second half. 

The 4-3-3 suits him a lot better than any role in the 4-2-3-1

3356~~~
Just for this game, he did OK. Still needs to be off!!!!

3357~~~

May be worthwhile keeping him for games against teams like WHU.

3359~~~
Played well and was vital in a good battle.  
Stop using your forearm!

3360~~~
Why? We shouldn't be re-active to other sides, we should be pro-active regardless of opposition.

3361~~~
Great lamp post. We wouldn't have scored the second goal if the ball didn't hit him

3362~~~
He's useful but limited and detracts from the team most days. I don't see why people have issue with him staying as a squad player. Unless he hampers a youth product coming through I don't.

3363~~~
Good game. One of our better players on the night. Should start most away games. Not so much hatred in the stands away from OT.

3364~~~
For how tough and rugged West Ham are said to be, they let this guy get away with murder, don't they?  Anyhow, this was probably his best game this season.  I think it's dumb playing him in a holding role when he should be nowhere but in front of goal, but he made use of a tough situation and won the game for us.

3365~~~
He's still not good enough. If we can recoup even 30% of his transfer fee I'll call that good business. One game doesn't change that

3366~~~
I see him like the midfield equivalent of Chicharito. Not good enough to start for the top teams because of a limited skillset, albeit it's something he is very good at. Ideally, he'd only be used when needed and not as a main option. He HAS come through in some big matches and rarely goes missing like some of his more talented teammates so I think for that at least he deserves credit. Plus he's the closest thing we have to a hardman at the moment.

3367~~~
Every time I see his name on the team sheet I die a little bit inside. Yes, he can be effective and yes, there is a begrudging flicker of respect for him rising above the constant criticism but he is just not good enough to be a United player. Nowhere near good enough.

3368~~~
Fvcking this

3369~~~
There are plenty of players in the squad who isn't quite good enough to be a United player. Fellaini is just one of them but disliked much more than others who get comparatively an easier ride.

3370~~~
Fellaini was very good vs West Ham it is a shame even after he plays well he will still get abuse for starting. I think Carrick has been far worse than him this season.

3371~~~
hasn't played wingback yet has he

3372~~~
Sir Alex won several titles by being re-active to other sides.

3373~~~
Good for him, he's the best manager the game has ever had.

You can name Bayern, Barca etc starting 11 every week assuming everyone is fit. 

Even Leicester don't panic about other sides players.

3374~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ej0w" width="560"></iframe>
Fair play to him, it was actually a very very astute finish. Until I saw it, the radio and everyone I spoke to made it out like it was a total fluker. The ghost inside and position he took up was very intelligent and the stab with his knee, I think it is a very intelligent finish.

edit: Have we stopped with the threadmarks?

3375~~~
Doesn't half get stuck in, does he? Good half from Fellaini.

3376~~~
Good performance from him so far, winning a lot of tackles and defensive headers.

3377~~~
He's a nuisance if you like that sort of thing.

3378~~~
A decent performance against a championship side.

3379~~~
Was better against West Ham - a team pushing for top four.

3380~~~
He's not good enough. Fact.

3381~~~
Fact, is it? Good enough for what? Anyway, not going into the that. What is fact is that he had a good game against West Ham, yet you only decide to add your snidey comment today.

3382~~~
Thought he was shit in the second half and his passing is abysmal.

3383~~~
best game in ages- nobody got elbowed today.

3384~~~
Was better than Schneiderlin. Passing was a bit poor, ruined a decent opportunity to break but was okay overall. It's not like we have worldbeater options at midfield.

3385~~~
Dont try to argue with the fachts.

3386~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3387~~~
I'm not going to argue with you. In my view Fellaini is a poor player and not good enough to play for a team that is challenging for top 4, the fact that you're disagreeing with me is amazing/worrying. 

My comment isn't "snidey", you're reading too much into it. It was a decent performance against a Championship side.

3388~~~
Why does he never make a pass further than 10 yards? It kills me to see opening after opening wasted because of his lack of creativity

3389~~~
It is snidney. You called Aston Villa as a championship side which is true but did you give him a proper credit against WHU? When he was talking about WHU performance you decided to ignore it and mentioned that he's not good enough for the club but the fact is 70% of our current players are not good enough.

3390~~~
Feckin jump man. So frustrating how he has this height advantage, but doesnt jump like 90% of the time.

3391~~~
What <a class="username" data-user="100978, @Mike09" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/100978/">@Mike09</a> said.

3392~~~
BTW, the only reason I quoted you and singled you out was because I remembered you criticizing him very harshly. You weren't the only one. This whole forum was (and to great extent still is) on his back but just remembered your name.

3393~~~
Ha don't worry about it. But, I did praise him when he done well last season tbf

3394~~~
He was good against the Hammers. A very average performance last evening. Overall, want him sold this summer.

3395~~~
Ok, if it makes you both feel any better. He had a decent game against West Ham. My original point still stands.

The reason i spoke of him and not the other 70% of our squad as you rightly say aren't good enough for the club, is because this is the Fellaini thread.

3396~~~
He's the very symbol of our decline in quality post-Fergie.

The fact that some fans think it's acceptable to play him on a regular basis for Manchester United just shows how far standards have dropped.

3397~~~
I'd actually have Rooney as that poster boy, he's the very essence of our decline in quality and standards. At least when Fellaini gets injured he doesn't come back overweight. 

Whoscored - Fellaini 7.1 - Rooney - 6.8.

3398~~~
That is a load of yesterdays garbage really. He's been at times this season and last season like the only one who actually gives a shit about playing for the club. Besides, there are hundreds of reasons with management alone before it even comes to the playing group.

People can keep going around talking this kind of rubbish and agreeing with each other and it won't make it any more true.

3399~~~
Would he get anywhere near our side during Fergie's reign? No he wouldn't. Why? Because he isn't a particularly good footballer at this level.

Just because he at times looks like he give a damn (and by God, he sure has looked disinterested for a large portion of his matches here as well) doesn't mean he's any good. 

I didn't say he's the reason for our decline, but he's the symbol of it: Moyes's first signing, severely lacking in quality, and playing regularly for a team that's miles off being what we should be. It's not coincidence that he's getting into our side, it just shows how far we've fallen.

3400~~~
There is no correlation to one single player and the league position of the club, stature of the club, general fictional target benchmark of the club. It was an empty and pointless claim and you're trying to continue to peddle it. It means absolutely nothing what sides he could or might play for in the future.

He's here, he's being selected and he's playing well when in form. Nothing more to be said really.

3401~~~
Yep. He would never be a starter for Fergie team, even the last one when Cleverley was regular for us. In fact, he couldn't get in a side ahead of Cleverley even in Moyes' season.

3402~~~
He really hasn't had a good season so far - and it's almost over. According to whoscored he's been our 15th best player overall. Not good enough. A hell of a lot better than that wimp Carrick though.

3403~~~
What does "when in form" mean? He played well against West Ham, and was poor yesterday. Form would dictate he follows on from his WH game and does well yesterday. But he didnt. Hes just that type of player.

Its no coincidence weve done better when hes not in the team compared to when he is.
Even our football has been better when he hasnt been in the team compared to when he has.

Sometimes its not his fault given our players laziness of just hitting hopeless balls to him, but sometimes it is cos of his lack of ability.

3404~~~
So? The point is your comment was snidey. Why don't you say the same thing to Rashford, Rooney, Smalling, Blind and De Gea "decent performance against Championship side". Why do you need to mention championship side to give a praise on player? 
What about WHU game? WHU isn't a championship side and you didn't give him a proper credit but you changed the topic to him being not good enough and the fact is not only him that is not good enough for United in our current squad. Even now your comment is still snidey. " if it makes you both feel any better".

3405~~~
My comment isn't "snidey", he did have a good game against a championship level side and in my view that's his level hence why I used that point in my original post. 

You're hammering the point about him also playing well against WHU which I have agreed with you on.

I maintain he isn't good enough to play for us, I can't work out or whether you're disagreeing with me on this or not.

You're reading too much into my comment and splitting hairs.

3406~~~
First you called it decent and now it's good. You need to make up your mind mate!!
Like I said before do you need to add " Championship" to praise someone? Why didn't you do the same thing to other players as well in their thread?

Nope, I'm just saying you are changing the topic right away when <a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a>  mentioned the WHU game. You didn't give him a proper credit when he talked about his performance vs WHU and instead you changed the topic to being not good enough.
Yeah true I am reading too much snidey comments of yours.

3407~~~
Let's just leave it at that. This discussion is dull and you're just repeating the same thing whilst splitting more and more hairs in the process.

3408~~~
For all his deficiencies at least he has a pair of bollocks unlike the vast majority of the spineless feckers.

3409~~~
I am repeating them because you just don't get with the fact how snidey your comments are.

3410~~~
Are you having trouble reading my posts?

Fellaini isn't the reason for our decline, but the fact that he's anywhere close to a United XI is simply quite symptomatic to our current position. It's not hard to comprehend what I'm writing, is it? Because you're arguing against no-one.

And Fellaini's been largely shit, bar a decent spell in Van Gaal's second season. It's not his fault, but he should really not be anywhere near a side of our ambitions (winning titles regularly).

3411~~~
I think Belgium (ranked 2nd team in the world) want him in their team don't they? I think you're being silly.

3412~~~
Answer me this: Will a side playing Marouane Fellaini in midfield consistently ever get close to winning a league title in a big league?

We both know the answer to that.

3413~~~
I sure hope so. We'll see.

3414~~~
Correct.

3415~~~
I disagree... He has a "pair of bollocks" when its cynical and snide. He'll snekily elbow a player off guard, but when the chips are down and other players need back up in a fracas - which has happened a few times this season - he's nowhere to be seen... Just like the rest of the senior players.

3416~~~
I am having trouble comprehending since you seem to be all over the place and you've not really got a clue what you're arguing about anymore. We get it, you don't think he's good enough but there isn't much moaning relentlessly is going to do come match-day. If the gaff picks the team and Fellaini is in it for whatever reason then there is not much you can do to stop that.

Continually coming up with half baked theories to do with players stature and worth to the team and trying to relate that to overall league position and hypothetical benchmarks for a league winning season is a pointless exercise. As is continuing to waste your breath talking about it as though it is some sage wisdom that you need to inform everyone of.

3417~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3418~~~
Take that, Everton fans who booed him for no reason.

3419~~~
All is forgiven!

3420~~~
Well done fro man.

3421~~~
That was great movement tbf to him. Excellently done.

3422~~~
Love when Fellaini shows up those slagging him off pregame.

3423~~~
Good goal. Been very good this game. Much more suited further up the pitch.

3424~~~
Good movement, scuffed finished. He's so much better the further up the pitch he is.

3425~~~
He's been fantastic. Always looks better when further forward and not in a midfield of two but today there isn't any of his usual sloppiness on the ball.

3426~~~
In FM language he is two stars out of five 'useful player'.

3427~~~
Definitely think he's a more useful player than Schneiderlin in a midfield three with another attacking midfielder (Rooney/Herrera).

3428~~~
Every time people are on his back he gets a goal or puts in a killer performance.

3429~~~
They should absolutely love him. Its rare to get 30m for a Championship level player

3430~~~
Continue to silence your critics, Fellaz. Good half from him.

3431~~~
Fairly good player.

3432~~~
Has been excellent on the ball so far. Far better than Rooney. Nothing much said about that though.

3433~~~
Hes been brilliant. Great fecking block.

3434~~~
MOTM by far.

3435~~~
Hilarious... how has he just come off??? van Gaal is an absolute clown.

3436~~~
Haven't always been his biggest fan, but gotta give credit where it's due.  Great performance from Fellaini today.  No doubt about it.

3437~~~
MOTM for me. He was everywhere today.

3438~~~
Excellent performance./

3439~~~
He was great today. One of his best games.

3440~~~
Monster of a game, really.

3441~~~
Absolutely immense today. Should have had two goals. Incredible block to stop Lukaku. Well played Fellaini. Well fecking played.

3442~~~
Played well today but I found the commentators talking up his 'giant contribution' with the block absolutely hilarious. If he hadn't made a completely moronic mistake in the first place none of it would have been necessary. Overall he had a very good game though so fair play.

3443~~~
I think that was kind of the point.

He mad a mistake, like all players do but he ran back all the way to fix that.

3444~~~
MOTM. I'm converted. Handy squad player going forward.

3445~~~
Played very well today overall. A few mistakes but made some equally positive contributions. Our third best player I felt, behind De Gea and Martial

3446~~~
True it was a great recovery.

3447~~~
Aye, it's a really simple point.

Overall, great game by Fellaini.

3448~~~
Very good today, I hope he can continue

3449~~~
He was very good today. He's criticized far too much on here imo

3450~~~
Played well. Liked his runs with the ball when he nicked the ball off someone. He won loads of balls in the air. A shame we are complete tosh at corners.

3451~~~
Another goal, and another very good performance from Fellaini. Played like a true box to box midfielder today. Great stuff.

3452~~~
Hopefully LVG will see he brings much more to the table than as a poor man's Andy Carroll. His strength in carrying the ball forwards is what we need more from midfield.

3453~~~
has been playing fairly well last few matches. happy for him with the goal.

3454~~~
It wasn't the point made by the commentators though, they didn't acknowledge once that it was a recovery from his own mistake. That's what made it funny, Murphy being completely oblivious as usual. Not having a dig at Fellaini, more the commentary. He was arguably motm today.

3455~~~
Got a goal and made a big block, overall a solid performance with some of his standard statue moments when we break.

3456~~~
Still don't want him here next season BUT he had a decent first and a lesser second. Credit where it's due.

3457~~~
He's definitely upped his game the last few weeks. I reckon he'll be here next year, whether it's Mourinho or Van Gaal.

3458~~~
Scored, made the block played well all round fair play to him.

Hes so much better operating further forward than he is in a midfield 2.

Still think we should have better but if he is on it should be where he was playing today.

3459~~~
I am not a big fan of Fellaini, especially the type of player he is, but he played well today. Was absolutely pumped up, decisive and gave a feck, not like his midfield partner.

3460~~~
He gave it all today. Very happy with his performance.

3461~~~
I won't deny that he did a lot of good things today, was a good performance.  In fact it would have been an excellent performance, were it not for the fact that even today he still managed to make more annoying, stupid, clumsy mistakes than just about any other player.  I recall yelling at the TV as he either stopped one of our attacks by passing it backwards 40 yards, or gave the ball away with a crap touch about 6 or 8 times.  To be fair, on about the worst of these occasions (that late one), he did leg it all the way back and put in an amazing saving tackle to makes amends for his mistake.

3462~~~
He keeps flipping my stance on whether to get rid or not. Right now I think he'll be a good bench option to have, but a few weeks back I'd have wanted him out of the club as soon as possible.

Very good game from him today, especially against his former team. I don't think he's had any particularly good games against Everton.

3463~~~
Good game from him.

3464~~~
Wonder how those 80% will defend decision if he stays and becomes JM`s cnut player.

3465~~~
He was very good in the first half. He faded badly in the second half, along with Rooney, which gave Everton a big incentive to take the game to us.

But even when he was less effective, he remained influential on the game. He should have had a goal or at least been awarded a penalty, and he made a crucial recovery block to make amends for his won carelessness on the ball high up the pitch. 

Rashford could have scored what would have been a fine goal from his beautifully cushioned knock down header.

I'd give him a 7.5/10 overall. He's far from perfect but is a threat, and that showed again. He's played a pivotal role in this cup run.

3466~~~
Surprised how Man Utd's twitter account didn't even nominate him for MOTM, because he was the MOTM IMO

3467~~~
The big fella strikes again! 

Fair play to him, he was great today.

3468~~~
I think I'm starting to as well. 

A solid player to have in the squad, and clearly doesn't let his critics get to him.

3469~~~
If he's played in the right position he's more than solid.

3470~~~
He's always a great option. You used to hear, that he slows down our play it's a team game. Some people will never give him any credit. Maybe that isn't such a bad thing. Maybe that negativity, made him track back when he made that 'error' - because  a lot of players wouldn't have sensed the growing danger. He can play and be a part of very good United performances. He's unconventional but that don't have to be a minus. He has goals him in and he's strong in both boxes. He went through a rotten spell earlier in the season - when United struggled in December. When chances fell his way and they just wouldn't go in. He's kept at it and did well today. Some will be happy but some will be bitter. He seems a popular member of the squad. Martial rates him as a friend in the dressing room. If we think back, Ruud wasn't happen when we sold Becks. I think we've a great dynamic here so I wouldn't sell him. It's a myth we can't see great football with him in the side.

3471~~~
Not surprising that when we reverted back to the 4-3-3 of old (and despite the pundits etc claiming otherwise, for me that is definitely how we were set up today) Fellaini looked so much better (amongst others). Its not a case of simply playing him higher up the pitch, it is about giving him the freedom to operate in a box to box capacity. Fellaini (and Rooney FWIW) are at their best when they are given a bit of license to roam, to get stuck in at both ends of the pitch and play their natural games without worrying too much about positional discipline etc - as they had Carrick behind in a holding capacity.

I had De Gea as MOTM though.

3472~~~
Gave the ball away & lucky to get back to block well, cos Lukaku was slow to get his shot off. Decent goal, decent performance level today.

This is how he or someone else should be playing in that position.  Saying 'great' & 'best performance/ tells you all you need to know.

Still naysaying I'm afraid.  He ain't never gonna be genuinely good enough on a consistent basis.

3473~~~
You have to give credit to the player for willing to drop all the way back from half pitch to our penalty box area. To me it wasn't lucky. He sensed the danger and he dropped back and block the shot at the right timing.

Overall it was a very good game from him. Won the ball so many time from opposition. Showed a few nice a bit of skills as well during the game and deserve that 2nd goal.

3474~~~
Your argument gives you a bias to look at things negatively. So in your mind, Lukaku was slow...but Fellaini still has to run back and make the block. You know? Defenders should be in that position, but they were no where. - they would have been closer to making a challenge so ultimately it was a good decision. But people have a bias.

We have to think about the group dymanic too. Would you sell one of Martials best mates? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> In turn, that might disappoint the dressing room. We've a good team spirit at the moment - despite everything. You can't have a team full of Martials. Fellaini isn't the reason we've flopped this season or any of the seasons. If we win the FA Cup it will bring tremendous confidence to the team.

3475~~~
Yes, that is one of those double edged events.  Good desire to want to get back & help the team, could have stood there sulking.

3476~~~
Well he's certainly part of it in the sense that we could have undoubtedly spent the money much better elsewhere. One of the reasons we've been failing is poor recruitment and surely no one can make a reasonable case that Fellaini at £27 million isn't included in that. But he's far from alone in that regard of course.

3477~~~
There are many of our players this season have been lazy to drop back. You look at Schneiderlin and Memphis vs Chelsea is one from many example of what happen when players don't drop back quickly, Through ball from Fabregas and Costa scored.

3478~~~
He gets abused for no reason tbf. He clearly that gives it his all every game he plays which is more than some of the other players that we have. Sure he isn't a silva or mata level in terms of talent but that doesn't make him useless. I'd rather have him in the squad than someone who could care less about the club like di Maria.

3479~~~
No DDG and martial were better

3480~~~
You're right, I mean it's not as if his assists were instrumental for 4th place last season and our creative spark nosedived this season. Give me elbowing and chest control  over anything that can be done with feet. That's what football is all about

3481~~~
While I've not really formed a great love for him, I have watched him for a long time. Even at Liege he was more than just a one-dimensional player. One thing that has stood out under LVG is that he is up for it in every game. It doesn't matter which game he is always up for it. His own fans don't like him and think he's a clown yet the timecard gets punched and he rolls his sleeves up and gets into his shift. 

I think that is a very MUFC aspect to his game that will prove useful in the next few years. If he's sold off then we'll thank him for his services but I think he has shown a lot of character in the last two seasons coming back from being viciously abused by fans who had their fingers burnt by Moyes.

Proud of him today, he did MUFC proud.

3482~~~
TBH, maybe one of his best (if not the best) games in a United shirt. And TBH, hes more suited to a 3 man midfield. Hes not a 2 man midfielder type of guy. Hes better when hes utilised in the opponents box (and it was the case last season when we had that purple patch).

I was quite surprised when he was subbed though, unless he was spent or injured.

3483~~~
Showed great heart today. Made some mistakes but every player makes mistakes, he really was up for it. Was surprised he wad taken off.

3484~~~
Good game today won plenty of headers, bagged a goal and made a key tackle on lukaku. Was right up there for MOTM for me just losing out to Martial and DDG.

3485~~~
Wish he could perform like that all the time

3486~~~
Another good performance and obviously looks more comfortable as an attacking option than deep midfielder.

3487~~~
He was good but I don't like how we constantly go to him when he plays.

3488~~~
Can't stand him and think he demonstrates brain-dead stupidity pretty much every game but credit where it's due - think he was good today, albeit mostly in a half against a team pretty easy to play against. I want him gone but can do a job in the 'easier' games if surrounded by players of better quality.

3489~~~
He is a very good option to have. We need his strength a bit against certain teams. Whether we like it or not, plan B with him is required. Also, he is one to perform and raise his level when needed generally. He has the right mentality too.

What I find it funny with people though is that they complain all the time that we don't have 'hard men or dirty men' on the pitch anymore. Or how we can't handle strengths or how there is no aerial threat from us. Then, this guy comes and performs decently most of the time yet they all want him gone.

Not saying he is a top player but he is useful.

3490~~~
Only managed to catch the first half but he looked very good, and of course got his goal.

3491~~~
VG's comments on Fellaini were very pertinent. "He is a player who wants to perform, what we have agreed. And that I like in him, but he is also good with his head for the set plays. Not only ours but also against us." Says a lot about his attitude and character with his former comments.

3492~~~
I think you hit the nail on the head. Van Gaal likes Fellaini, and starts him, not because he's a world class talent, but because he complies with Van Gaal's "philosophy". He's does what he's told, more or less. 

I'm not the biggest Fellaini fan. I generally view him as a rather limited player, and would like to see us upgrade. That said, there's no denying he has certain attributes and can be useful. He's been good lately, and deserves more praise than he gets. That said, I don't think there's really any more we're going to see from him. He's as good as he's ever going to be. I can't picture ever winning a Champions League final with a player like Fellaini in our starting 11.  We should aspire to a higher level than Fellaini can offer.

3493~~~
Seeing him in the lineup never fills me with confidence...but I have an unbelieveable amount of respect for this guy.
He is most likely to move on but think he'll be remembered fondly. The fact no fan rates him and yet he keeps giving it a right go for the team. 
Btw he is seemed to be running into some sort of form like the rest of the team.

3494~~~
The box-to-box role is his best position. Should only play in a 4-3-3 or not at all. 

The fact that he's started as #10 at Manchester United, when other clubs have De Bruyne, Ozil, Eriksen, Isco is a damning indictment of this club, the managers we have hired and the players we have bought.

3495~~~
Really ? I thought he would be exactly the sort of player that could win you a CL Final. I mean imagine him being up against Pique, Mascherano and Busquets. I think he would do really well.

He had an excellent game yesterday. I mean he dribbled with the ball, brought others into play, was defensively excellent. Like others, I was surprised he was subbed for Herrera, but van Gaal I guess wanted Herrera to find those pockets of space in those last minutes or in ET to feed our forward players. Very impressed with him.

3496~~~
Has to be his best game for Utd.

I've given him a lot of stick but have to be fair, he was very good yesterday. Even his big mistake he made up for with a brilliant last second block.

3497~~~
lol, whenever Fellaini has a great game they call them best game for United. To be honest myself some of his games last season were better performance than today.

3498~~~
I'm happy for him and his contribution yesterday. I really want him to do well, as he seems to be a professional in the true sense of the word and is well liked in every team he plays. With that being said he's such a painfully limited player. There's absolutely no range to his passing, which was extremely evident with Carrick just not being able to do it as he used to. Numerous times Fellaini could have opened up our play to a different side. We used him well yesterday and he has a habit of being in the right place at the right time offensively, but IMO he makes it difficult for us defensively whenever he plays. Rooney had to help out a lot because of that.

3499~~~
His best game for us probably. A hustle and bustle box to box role suits him better, his skill set isn't right for a more creative role.

3500~~~
Fair fecks to Marouane. Great game. My MOTM. 

He has a unique skillset which he didn't put to use enough this season. I'd still sell him as he's had three years and still not really justified his place but if he played like that more regularly you see the player we hoped we bought. Most of our best performances under LvG have featured him in the line up. He's got balls. Hope he has a good Euros and find a good club where he can fire from the off next season.

3501~~~
Just watched his goal again. His movement leading up to it was excellent. Pulled defender away then darted forward. Super play and good finish.

3502~~~
Not a fan of his, but an excellent game from him. Best I've seen him play for us.

3503~~~
Against teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, I think the game would pass him by. I completely agree that he played well against Everton, but their midfield doesn't come within a country mile of Champions League winning caliber. Against smart, quick and technically proficient midfielders he's been much less successful. He's always going to be a nuisance in the opposing team's box, but he's just too limited a player for my liking.

3504~~~
Deserves to start in midfield in the final, although I'd like to see Schneiderlin and Herrera in.

3505~~~
I suspect that Mourinho won't be in as much of a rush to sell him as perhaps some on here would like.

3506~~~
Well, that's the point I was alluding to. I agree with you that games of that level are very likely to pass him by. But if you throw him in with 20 odd minutes remaining and us reverting to a very direct style of football, his nuisance will be very handy in searching for an equalizer or a winner. That is ofcourse if these European referees choose to be a bit more sensible with their decision making. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3507~~~
I don't think we disagree then. I have no problem with Fellaini as a squad player / option off the bench. If we're aspiring to compete with the best clubs in the world, though, he's simply not good enough to be a consistent starter in my opinion.

3508~~~
What's wrong with going to him? You think we're Barcelona? Some of you are funny. He's in the XI, if going to win will get required result, then why not?

3509~~~
Very poor on the ball but to his credit, he is scoring some very important goals.

3510~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It doesn't even make sense does it? They're passing to a player too much? He doesn't even get it played to him more than others anyway and how the hell can you utilize a player too much? Madness.

3511~~~
Are you talking in general or on the basis of yesterday's performance? Because if it is the latter I strongly disagree. He was rampaging and setting the tempo unusually. Wish he played like this more often and my view is his time is coming to an end but he showed his quality yesterday and against West Ham.

3512~~~
Question: why can't we just say "he had a good/great game yesterday" without "but he is this he is that, don't want him next season" and all of that talk? How about giving him a slack for one week? I mean, we're 4 weeks before the end of the season with two targets left for us, and if he contributes as he did yesterday that will be great. Over the summer, we will have plenty of time to discuss whether or not he will/should stay next season. 

Same for other players who divide opinions.

3513~~~
I spotted Fellaini on a flight from Manchester to Rome today. He had a funny hat on but it was him alright. 

Any rumours of him to Italy?  Or just a short break?

3514~~~
First Sahko, now Fellaini. Those "fat burners" must really work!

3515~~~
He's clearly better in the 4-3-3 (as most of our players are). Yet again he stands up for us in a big game too. A lot of his good performances/moments have come in high pressure situations. Gets way too much criticism on here, comments like 'he's the worst United player I have ever seen' are just so far from the mark. He's never going to be Zidane or Scholes but he battles. Considering all the shit he cops his mentality to continue to stand up when we need him is admirable.

3516~~~
one of his better performance for sure. he was everywhere!

3517~~~
Someone will find a way to start the rumour. but it's definitely just a break.

3518~~~
another big goal.

scored against Palace to seal 4th last season.

scored against Brugge to get us a 2 goal cushion that basically killed the tie. 

a goal in the quarters and now the semis of the cup. Wouldn't get against him getting the winner at Wembley.

I love how he brushes of the critism and doesn't let it affect him. Many a player would have struggled to bounce back from that horrendous first season,but he is mentally very strong. He's a fighter, I love players like that.

3519~~~
Funny you should say that as last season most of his best perfomances came against the top sides like City and Chelsea...

3520~~~
He is a plan B and should be viewed as such.

3521~~~
I just love how his triumph's annoys people.

3522~~~
Turns up when required, have to admire him tbh

3523~~~
Me too.

3524~~~
Is this a joke? He got out-jumped by Joe Allen a few weeks back. 

That's just his hair. Hopefully he's house-hunting over there.

3525~~~
I meant it in context, as a sub against a tiring opposition. And who cares if he got out jumped by Allen. On his day, he's a bloody nuisance in the box and can easily compete against top tier defenders.

3526~~~
We'll have to agree to differ on this one. For me, to genuinely contend against the top teams and 'top tier defenders', you need players who out-perform their opponents every day, not just 'compete'... 'on their day'.

3527~~~

3528~~~
True, I won't dispute that, but if you take Fellaini's strength's into consideration and pit it against the likes of Pique, Mascherano and Busquets, I think there's a good chance he will do well. The only player of the three who I mentioned whose heading I rate is Pique. But yeah, if he's going to start a game, then the likes of Iniesta, Rakitic will run him ragged.

3529~~~
I like the new way of using him to defend corners. Everybody thinks he's just going to take out their no.1 threat, but now he's attacking the ball from the middle of the box and that has been very effective so far. Rojo, Smalling are man-marking and thus giving him the space to get to the ball first.. Just another great defensive play from the management.

3530~~~
To be fair don't see many posts in here by people in recent weeks expressing annoyance. Have you seen any?

The vast majority of people have said he played well in the last 2-3 games, and i'm sure we're all glad he scored a goal to help us get to a cup final.

3531~~~
I see annoyance in a lot of posts my friend. Begrudged acknowledgements   are a dime a dozen in this thread. They lie in wait for an opportunity to criticise.

3532~~~
Be gutted if he were to leave. Guess most people will think I'm mad (couldn't give a feck), but he's one of my favourite players at the club. It's mad, though, because I hated him at Everton.

3533~~~
Please please please go to Roma

3534~~~
That's 3 years of criticsm now. Can you see a logical pattern here ?

Perhaps he really failed the expectations if you care to look at totality of his time in United.

3535~~~
So what you are essentially saying is people praise him when he plays well and criticize him when he doesn't.

Great observation mate.

3536~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3537~~~
Fellaini suffers a different kind of criticism for me, its like people want him to fail. I couldn't help sense some sarcasm on your part with that comment, not cool man.

3538~~~
I didn't say anything about 3 years. Has he been a failure at meeting expectations, not for me.

3539~~~
I think you got it spot on.

3540~~~
Looks like you had terribly low expectations.

3541~~~
If even that was the case.

3542~~~
Let's say "different".

3543~~~
Look sorry for being sarcastic mate honestly, but all i've seen for the most part in here is people even those like myself who are harsh on him when he's shit. Coming in after he's played well and praising him for it.

I doubt any United fan with half a brain actually wants Fellaini to fail or is annoyed when he plays well. Because his fortunes and United's are linked.

Sorry mate i don't understand your post.

3544~~~
The way he won defensive headers in the Everton game is what I'd expect of him regularly, being able to shield the ball in midfield and popping up in the box are bonus advantages. Its frustrating when he isn't able to dominate aerially, especially on set piece duties.

3545~~~
Fair enough hey.

3546~~~
Think it'd be a bad move for him, his size makes him more suited to a fast league like England.

3547~~~
He's done alright in one or two games lately. Still want him gone but wouldn't be too bothered if he stayed as a squad player.

3548~~~
This doesnt make any sense to me. One of the main criticisms aimed at him in this thread is that he lacks mobility etc. So how can a fast league suit a player who lacks mobility?

3549~~~
Im sorry but this doesn't make sense. I actually think it would suit him. Fellaini is not very quick on his feet and he tends to dilly dally on the ball if he doesn't have a quick pass option to a teammate within feet of him because his range of passing is limited. The chess game in Italy would suit him perfectly

3550~~~
huh?

3551~~~
My bad i quoted wrong post <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3552~~~
Pretty much this.  Fellaini has real value as a squad man for United.  Against the physical clubs that comprise about half the premier league, his brutish play is an effective foil.  Against silkier clubs we expect to play next season in Europe and the top 4-5 clubs in England he's less effective, but still a decent player to have come off the bench even against top clubs.

Still, I'd like to see Fellaini be more consistent in winning headers.  For a big man he's way too soft in challenging for winnable balls.  And he's got to be more disciplined in his use of elbows.

3553~~~
I feel exactly the way you do. Call me silly but I feel like Fellaini has even more to offer than this. Somehow, in a team full of stars he'd be very good squad addition helping us get through some of the messier fixtures/cup games etc.

I also disliked him at Everton which is why I love him at United. I love the fact that one of our players can be annoying to the opponent. 

Lastly, as a squad an important aspect of him is his commitments. You can tell he just gives it his all which is very important. Take for example Di maria -- abundance of talent and obviously considered a higher caliber player than Fellaini but which one is more useful in a squad? The Di Maria of the last half of last season or a Fellaini as a squad member in form.

3554~~~
As for most of the other team members, I will wait to see him under a new manager and consistently in a more attacking role as he did at Everton, rather than midfield one day, striker the other.
But still he would be Plan B, unless he has a Young (last season) like make over

3555~~~
Nainngolan is goin to chelsea and fellaini might be his replacement is whats foing the rounds on twitter.

3556~~~
I think it is because, despite having all manner of shit thrown at him this season he still gives a shift for the shirt alone. It is in the blood if you are a United supporter to support this type of player.

It is quite possible, re the article above. He is very good friends with Radja and has been for a long time, it is his birthday next week and they went out for dinner to celebrate while he was in Rome. This could just be press guessing, I doubt a player would go to another country ahead of a move without hearing about agent talks first, unless there is a press blackout of epic proportion. In my opinion.

3557~~~
He would almost certainly be on his way if Mourinho comes. We can't be buying new players like Griezmann and others if the likes of Mata and Fellaini are still lingering about.

3558~~~
No worries mate

3559~~~
Never the player he was at Everton . Good luck to him



Marouane Fellaini’s agent has said that a move to Italian side Roma “is a possibility to consider”.

Hairy Belgian elbow man Fellaini has failed to win over Manchester United supporters since joining the club as David Moyes’ only signing in the summer of 2013 at Old Trafford.

The midfielder has enjoyed some promising games in a United shirt, including as a lone striker in the 3-1 win over Liverpool in September, and as a goalscorer in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Everton recently, but he has also been not great at the best of times.

Fellaini, 28, was seen watching Roma play Napoli in Italy on Monday, a game in which compatriot Radja Nainggolan scored the goal which crowned Juventus Serie A champions for a fifth consecutive season.

Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport then reported that Roma were interested in signing Fellaini, and his agent, Luciano D’Onofrio discussed his client’s future with Tuttomercatoweb.

“He was probably there on holiday,”  D’Onofrio said. “For the moment I have no other news. So far I’ve had no contact with Roma for him.

“Would that move be welcomed? Yes, Roma is a possibility to consider.”

3560~~~
Has he left yet?

3561~~~
Sorry to get your hopes up .But he's as good as this coming window.

3562~~~
I can't wait for this season to end.

3563~~~
How much will we get for him? Is £15m too optimistic

3564~~~
Add me to this crazy bunch.

3565~~~
Was watching the Leicester Swansea game today,and that Wes Morgan is rather dirty to be honest 

I'd play Fellaini to match that threat. He can take it as well as dish it out.

3566~~~
One thing I like about him is his mental strength, I think he has a winning mentality and that is important.

3567~~~
This is the best I've seen him play so far. Early days in this game, but he's playing excellently.

3568~~~
Good game again. Not sure why he was in the wall for their free kick?

3569~~~
Stupid elbow. Decent otherwise.

3570~~~
He has been very effective, but the fecking idiot will surely and deservedly pick up a 3 game ban

3571~~~
Huth was also out of order pulling his hair.

3572~~~
He's playing well again. Shame his season is over after that silly elbow.

3573~~~
It's absolutely incredible that Sky are just completely denying that Huth had any part in that whatsoever. 

Retrospective bans for the pair of them.

3574~~~
Very good first half but...

3575~~~
Shouldn't have retaliated of course, although Hugh clearly pulling his hair etc should be a mitigating factor in my opinion.

3576~~~
He will be back for the cup final

3577~~~
Great work, Fellaini, ruling yourself out of the FA Cup final. Clown.

Edit. Or maybe not.

3578~~~
In this day and age, there was very few people who wouldnt react to such a situation. Its brilliant hearing Alan Smith and the entirr Sky crew ignore that Huth turned into a fanny and resorted hair fecking pulling.

3579~~~
I don't think you should ban someone for hair pulling. It's just annoying but not dangerous. An elbow to the face, on the other hand...

3580~~~
He just reacted for Huth's pathetic hair-pulling.. Good first half, needs to get some quicker passes going..

3581~~~
There would always be a but with him innit?

3582~~~
Needs to hit Huth harder.

3583~~~
Fellaini should probably get a retrospective ban for the elbow. But let's remember Leicester/Huth got away with these two this season:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/00b4" width="560"></iframe>

3584~~~
His last game with us? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3585~~~
Not sure there exists a measuring system good enough to describe just how much of a shite cnut Fellaini is.

3586~~~
No. He will be here next season, and deservedly so.

3587~~~
I think regardless of whether it was coming to Huth for his role in the tussle, I'm convinced that elbow/s from Fellaini might have knocked him clean out if it/they had landed properly. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Looked so damn vicious.

3588~~~
Replay is quite clear that Fellaini is starting the movement to elbow Huth before he pulls his fannyhair.

3589~~~
Hopefully not. This is football not chest/elbow play. It's time to remove the rubbish from this squad. We are many United not bolton

3590~~~
I'm sorry, but this is harsh. In the past 3 weeks he scored two goals for us in the FA cup. In fact, Fellaini, Martial and Rashford scored almost goals for us recently.

3591~~~
He's been here for 3 years not 3 weeks. He's not good enough and if we want to return to the top then the likes of him should leave. I'm sure a team like stoke will be glad having him

3592~~~
He's f*ckin shit.

3593~~~
FA cup final and deservedly so <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3594~~~
I never said but with him. But this time I have to say it. The elbow

3595~~~
Hopefully the fa will catch him doing a fellaini to Huth on video and make an example out of him

3596~~~
Should be his last game for the club.

3597~~~
Hopefully <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3598~~~
I bet he starts the next game

3599~~~
Yes please!

3600~~~
Got a feeling Fellaini will get away with it because Huth was pulling his hair.

3601~~~
His problem like too many in our squad is even if he spends 20 minutes or so in a game playing well and doing good things, he'll spend another 20 minutes looking like a complete shit-bag.

3602~~~
he's a terrible human being

3603~~~
Did alright today but his discipline is atrocious.

3604~~~
He's Diouf with a wig.

3605~~~
Possibly last game for us if Mourinho sells him in the summer as he should get a 3 game ban after the elbow

3606~~~
I thought he had some decent moments on the ball today and almost got an assists, that elbow and swipe at Huth is gonna cost him 3 games though.

3607~~~
He'll be available for the cup final.

3608~~~
Mourinho will become an instant fan favourite if he boots Fellaini out the door.

3609~~~
Don't think Mourinho cares much for being a fan favourite after the way he dealt with Mata. Cause he's Mourinho, the fans will eat up every action he takes until results turn to shite.

3610~~~
TBH, if somebody pulled my hair, id be tempted to do more than an elbow, whether its the right or wrong thing to do.

But what annoys me is he doesnt fecking jump. JUst jump man, and you will have the huge advantage over people in set pieces. A few times he was caught underneath the ball cos he waited for it rather than attacking it like he did a few times at Everton.

3611~~~
We play better with him. 

Him and Smalling are the only people that can win a header. No wonder we're crap at set pieces.

3612~~~
Fight of the century: Huth vs Fellaini. <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> We need a gif of those two fighting each other. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Huth rips Fellainis hair why Fellaini used his elbow to uppercut the cnut. Lmfao.

3613~~~
The movement to elbow Huth starts before he has his hair pulled.

3614~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a91mrDs6dSE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
I'm with Afroman on this one

3615~~~
Yes, and his hair is pulled before Fellaini's elbow reaches Huth's jaw, your point?

He also has his hand on his head beforehand, what the feck are we trying to discuss here?

3616~~~
The point being that Fellaini elbowing Huth had little to do with the hair pull.

3617~~~
You cannot defend shite with shite but if Fellaini deserves a ban then so does Huth!

3618~~~
No, it actually did as he's had his hair pulled before he elbowed Huth. I know that you love crying about him here so I don't expect you to agree with me but you're talking shit.

Fellaini will get a ban though and I expect him to be back for the FA final.

3619~~~
Thought he did alright today, wish he was more consistent game to game, not half as useless as some make him out to be.

3620~~~
Replay is quite clear, elbow is already on it's way in when his hair gets pulled, so don't be daft.

3621~~~
I really am not the daft one in here.

3622~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/kmn7" width="560"></iframe>

3623~~~
feck, you're right <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3624~~~
Whatever makes you feel better.
Replay doesn't agree with you though.

3625~~~
Huth's hair pull was stupid, Fellaini's elbow was stupid, reckless and aggressive!

3626~~~
What's he saying?

3627~~~
to score the winner... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3628~~~
Cannot stand the man, our other CMs weren't great today but having him anywhere near our starting 11 is depressing.

3629~~~
or to get a red in the first minute of the first half, which is more likely!

3630~~~
He elbowed him because he's a cock, not because he had his hair pulled. He's a stupid cnut

3631~~~
Such poor discipline.

3632~~~
Hope he has played his last game with us. Wishful thinking I know.
We play bad enough without him but with him we just try to get the ball to him which is so boring, predictable and easy to defend against. This, or he will committ a foul anyway even if we manage to get into a half decent goal scoring position. The rare occasions he actually manages to score are just not worth at all having him here as far as I am concerned.

3633~~~
Another good performance from Fellaz. Was pretty quiet in the second half, though. I guess everyone was, but for some reason we stopped doing what got us joy in the first half. Getting the ball wide and standing it up to Fellaini at the back post, where he often used his aerial threat to knock it down.

Huth shouldn't have pulled his hair, but two wrong don't make a right, and Fellaini was wrong to elbow him. Hopefully he'll not get banned because he'll be an important player for us, going into our last few games.

3634~~~
He'll definitely get a ban for the elbow and rightly so.

3635~~~
Had a good game, but he'll be rightfully suspended for the elbows.

3636~~~
Had an alright game but a massive liability. He should go. These elbows are just disgusting.

3637~~~
I actually hope he is banned.

3638~~~
Has to go!

3639~~~
Think you guys are being a bit harsh on him. 

He reacted to Huth being all over him. What else was he supposed to do? Let it continue on?

3640~~~
He's lucky Huth just jumped, otherwise he'd break his nose for certain and this would have been an even bigger deal.

Now, he just elbowed him in the throat <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3641~~~
Agree with this, if Fellaini gets banned, Huth also deserves one.

3642~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="87382, @harms" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87382/">@harms</a>. Can't stop laughing of Huth's faceexpressions after Fellaini landed that elbow on him really. I dunno what's worse really, Fellainis elbow or Huths hair pulling. What kind of men does hair pulling though?...But I think most of us know how it feels to get our hair pulled, and that's not a nice feeling so I understand why Fellaini reacted that way. But unfortunatly Fellaini are using those elbows just a bit too much.

3643~~~
I agree when somebody is touching your shirt a bit too much it's best to throw elbows. The guy is a total moron

3644~~~
Under LVG who's been better than Fellaini for us?

3645~~~
Huth may have provoked him but how many times has Fellaini thrown an elbow? It's not just today. He's an idiot.

3646~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

De Gea
Fosu-Mensah
Shaw
Varela
Smalling
Blind
Borthwick-Jackson
Schweinsteiger 
Herrera
Young
Mata
Schneiderlin
Lingard
Carrick
Valencia
Martial
Rashford

3647~~~
You should be ashamed that this cnut wears your shirt.

3648~~~
De Gea and Smalling aside. I largely disagree. People don't like his playing style which is fair enough but he's played a lot more than some of those players and been more effective than a fair few too.

3649~~~
He's only really been effective in short bursts. He had a good 2014/15 season overall, but he's done very little this season as his stats suggest. He doesn't score or assist anywhere near as often as a midfielder with his height/stature should, especially when he's often been lauded for it. And anyway, his positives are often outweighed by the way in which he hinders the team.

3650~~~
Would love to see how the FA ban Fellaini without giving Huth similar treatment

3651~~~
Pretty easily I'd have thought given elbowing someone in the face/throat is obviously more violent.

3652~~~
Violent conduct is violent conduct, it'll be a dangerous precedent to set to give one a harsher ban than the other

3653~~~
It was a clear provocation from Huth and Fellaini did just what he was hoping for, but the ref didn't see it.

3654~~~
Are you really saying that Fellaini has been our second best outfield player this season? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Even for this thread, which is full of extreme opinions, this has to be one of the craziest ones.

You even left Martial out <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3655~~~
Sorry but he has been here for 3 years, has almost 10 years experience as EPL player, 3rd most experienced EPL in our squad and yet all we have is less than a handful of quality games. For all the stick that Mata gets, he has had a  lot of good games and despite being shifted about he still is among the goals and assists every season. Fellaini is not a good player just an average player that has the odd 2 game purple patch sporadically.

3656~~~
Is this a serious question?

Jesus he's been better in recent weeks and scored some important goals when playing further forward and fair play to him for it.

But for the majority of the season he was dogshit further back in central midfield.

3657~~~
The cheers when he gets subbed are embarrassing. No one would do that if it was Rooney and he offers less than Fellaini.

3658~~~
I am sorry, but Mata does not have a lot of good games. He is a tidy player no doubt but most of the time he does nothing, and only adds to whatever's already happened. He will only play well if others start playing well before him. He gets a decent amount of goals and assists only at the benefit of the play of players around him (90% of the time). Fellaini, for all his faults, will always give it his all. Mata is mainly a coward on the pitch. I'd argue Fellaini has had a great impact at his time here than Mata.

3659~~~
I was ashamed by Fellaini today. 

He should have broken Huth's fecking nose the second he began pulling his hair like a hormonal harpy.

3660~~~
He had much more good games than Fellaini, but they are not highlighted as much because it's not surprising to see a player of Mata's talent to do well.
And here it is again, Fellaini "giving his all" sentiment. Well, maybe his all is so close to zero that this opinion can be justified, but Fellaini's workrate is awful, he just walks around the pitch (because he literally can't or won't run) and fouls the people that got in his way (0,8 tackles per 1 foul). I don't think that "giving your all" mean constant fouling.

3661~~~
Mata has contributed far more than Fellaini. His work rate since coming here has also generally been excellent, so unless by "give his all" you mean be willing to foul people for no particular reason...

3662~~~
By giving it all, I mean that when United are looking for a goal he will be up there in the box fighting for the ball, not like Mata who will just pass it sideways and cower on the wing. For someone so supposedly creative he really doesn't try many through balls.

3663~~~
More like standing there and waiting for the second coming while he (a midfielder) is needed deeper in building-up the attacks. How much of the aerial duels does he actually win btw? Around 40%? And how many goals came directly from him standing near the back post, "giving his all"?

Mata and his creativity is another issue. I agree with you. When I looked at the Chelsea highlights he looked like a player of David Silva's mode, but he is much more limited, sadly, and is not a playmaker

3664~~~
I said over the two years (so not really including this seasons signings, or youngsters that have had a few games here or there). Martial has clearly been better than him, but only this season. Consider our signings this season, aside from Martial. Memphis, Darmian, Morgan, Basti and Romero. Injuries/manager selections have hampered them, but they've hardly been better than Fellaini.

Not saying he's necessarily been our second best outfield player over the past two years, but considering the level our outfield players have performed at over the past two seasons, I don't consider this high praise by any stretch.

3665~~~
He's shite...He's awful...He has no technical ability....No first touch....No eye for a killer pass....Takes the safe option....He's not brave.....He can't tackle....He can't pass....He bottles out of a lot of challenges.....He can't even hit someone properly....Ronnie Corbett and Warwick Davis were/are more of a threat in the air than this clown ffs 

Yet....I'm giving him credit because he tries to do something........

Manchester United 2016

3666~~~
Not really, the hairpull would have been a yellow card and the elbow a red. And not all violent conduct is treated the same, e.g. Suarez biting, Ben Thatcher's elbow

3667~~~
Funniest thing that if it was just about anybody else playing, probably bar Rooney and Lingard, who pulled the trigger on Huth yesterday there would be no discussion after that hair pulling. Of course, it's not groundless as he's done that before, sure, but it's still looking silly. Hair pulling, while not as dangerous as smacking somebody with your elbow, is as shite practice as trying to penetrate somebody's anus with your finger Jara style or biting somebody (I'm not referring to Suarez now). I don't think that in this particular moment his reaction was much off but he will get banned for it no doubt unless the ref mentions that he's seen the incident in the after-match report.

Huth pretty much knew what he was doing too, he got smacked by Fellaini and he didn't roll down like a puss or run to the referee with the thing.

3668~~~
That is exactly why there is a discussion. When you do something like elbow people in face the criticism is going to get worse and worse each time. Huth knew he could get Fellaini to react that way because he's a moron who reacts like that all the time, it doesn't normally even take a hairpull to get him to do it.

3669~~~
Looks like Huth is checking if Fellaini's Afro is real or a wig!

3670~~~
Thing is that you'll see some idiots here trying to pretend that hair pulling is alright just for the sake of blaming him. I really can't blame him for this particular elbow.

3671~~~
Am I missing a particular video clip in which Huth actually pulled his hair? Or are certain people unfolding events with their own eyes and saying he's not at fault?

3672~~~
Like you or what? Are you really discussing if he pulled his hair?

3673~~~
Pulling his hair isn't right but if the ref saw the elbow and sent him off he would have only himself to blame. Silly.

3674~~~
I'm a self-admitted Fellaini fan as most who follow this thread will know, but I think he started to swing the elbow <i>before </i>the hair pull. Huth's action shouldn't be forgotten though, was stupid and they both should be banned IMO. Silly from Fellaini because it gives Schneiderlin and Herrera a good opportunity to get his spot for the F.A Cup final. That being said there is no way I would be picking either of those two ahead of him.

3675~~~
In a somewhat predictable manner, the pseudo-outrage over the elbow is so cringeworthy.

He had an excellent first half, I only got to watch the first half live. I'll probably watch the game again tonight. Good to see his form peaking a little before the cup final. Deserves a ban for the elbow but anyone who pulls somebody's hair can't complain about being twatted one, good on him.

- Manchester United fans 2016.

3676~~~
It was surprising that Micheal Oliver of all the people missed it. Yesterday he was blowing the whistle the moment our players jumped into a tackle, as if he knew he had to give the foul against us instantly.
Fellaini is probably gone for the season. Hope Huth gets punished too.

3677~~~
Like the awkward over-sized uncoordinated kid at school. You don't really want him in your team but it's 'orrible playing against him.

3678~~~
Even over two years Martial has been better than him.

The only players that hasn't been better than Fellaini since his arrival (and played more than a few games) are Rojo and maybe McNair/Januzaj. Struggle to think about anyone else, which saying something, as basically all of our players underperformed.

3679~~~
Jones, Darmian, Herrera, Carrick, Basti, Morgan, Lingard, Memphis, Rojo. Imo been as good if not better than these guys over the past two seasons.

Could throw in others like Mata where I don't think there's been a great difference in terms of effectiveness.

I just disagree with the notion that he's been awful under LVG. Pretty much no one likes his playing style (me included) and long term wise, I struggle to see him being a United player should we progress to the next level. But as we are now, he's been better than most I think.

The guy wasn't wanted from when we first signed him and since day 1 it's pretty clear many fans don't like him. Just look at any match day thread and the level of criticims Fellaini would get compared to someone else. He does something good and little praise compared to someone else.

3680~~~
He hasnt been that good either.

3681~~~
Should of been 2 reds if the ref saw it so not all that pissed off about this elbow.

Another lacklustre performance though. He epitomises LVGs tenure in a way, has a good game or two then cements his place in the side and plays rubbish. He can't tackle and is average on the ball so the only reason he's in there is to win headers and he's not doing enough for me.

3682~~~
I've not said he's been that good. Just he's been more effective than a big chunk of our squad over the two years.

3683~~~
Yeah go on, I wouldn't massively argue that MF has performed at a level approximately average & middle-ish when compared to a selection of other signings (as was nicley outlined above).  Some have definitely been worse & contributed less.

So that's good then, innit?  Speaks right well of our recruitment achievements.

3684~~~
Yes. Unless he pulled his hair in some other clip way before the elbowing then I don't understand. Unless you believe he reacted at the exact same time as Huth touched his hair as if he was Floyd Mayweather. Judging by his general movement I would suggest he is not Mr Mayweather

3685~~~
Obviously not; but people are always quick to get onto Fellaini when we have guys doing less.

On our recruitments, I think LVG has been a big factor in why so many have under performed. Only Blind and Martial have played week in week out.

3686~~~
If this team wants to return to its former best then players like Fellaini (and there's quite a list of player who qualify in this position) must leave. They are simply not good enough for a title contending team

3687~~~
Forgot about Memphis - on him I agree. The rest of the list - no, absolutely no. Anyone who played a full game over those two years and showed an average ball-retention and defensive skills are already better than Fellaini.

3688~~~
He is a terrible player and it just shows in what state our club is in when people defend him here.. He is a terrible header of the ball, can´t pass, can´t shoot,No positional sense and a terrible tackler.. All that makes him useless.. I give him that he has been ok in couple of games. But that some here see him as an ok player just tells me how far we have fallen..

3689~~~
And this sums up exactly what I mean. I don't even rate Fellaini highly but over the top criticism time and time again.

This guy must be the most hated/abused player we've had and it's been since day 1.

3690~~~
Honestly, best to just ignore it lad. They will drop the excessive hyperbole rants regardless. It doesn't matter what happens people will still say he doesn't know how to play football. It will never change.

3691~~~
He was very good against Everton and reverted to poor form yesterday. I think the midfield we played yesterday showed zero creativity and we definitely needed someone like Ander over Fellaini since Leicester were going to sit back.

3692~~~
It's easy to see why people are critical regardless of his level of performance. He's constantly doing stupid things and his style is awful to watch. Best for everyone if he's moved on.

3693~~~
It's like your mum buying you some bad threads when you were young that you had to wear. Never wanted it, embarrassed by it, hated every second of it, can't wait til it's destined for the bin.

3694~~~
I don't know how people come up with stuff like Mata is a coward. Admittedly Mata lacks the physical presence that the average PL footballer has and that has stood against him time and time again. His lack is physicality is mostly down to genetics and what not but he has done well in that he has done well to develop himself technically above the most players. Fellaini on the other hand is only surviving on his physicality which he probably didn't have to work much on. To call a player a coward becasue what stands against him is something that he cannot change is a lazy comment.

3695~~~
I see people mention Mata and Fellaini. For me they are both in the same bag, they don't suit us, they don't give us something special, they are not integral to our game, they both stick out like sore thumbs in our roster. Because they are not fundamentally bad they will have good games from time to time but at the end of the day they are both a waste of money and space.

3696~~~
Can you please tell me what I said there that is abusive? That´s just my opinion and he hasn´t shown anything to prove me wrong..

3697~~~
This confuses me. He is a <i>huge </i>part of us defending set-pieces. That alone makes him better defensively that Herrera, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Young, Depay, Mata etc

3698~~~
I wasn't referring directly to you.

3699~~~
Not as huge as you think friend. Set pieces make up the smallest portion of defensive contributions in a 90 minute game. From the above you have mentioned, Herrera, Schneiderlin and quite possibly Young make more defensive contributions than Fellaini. Just because the ones they make do not happen in areas that could directly lead to a goal, it's doesn't make it any less of a defensive contributions. I'm not saying that Fellaini makes the fewest defensive contributions but from I would expect from him, he is far too unsuccessful or makes too few, making him very disappointing for me.

3700~~~
This

3701~~~
But come one mate he tries, he's a real trier. While loads of other players around him are only trying to try he steps and actually tries to do something. It rarely comes off but he tries. 

He's been better recently (which wouldn't be hard considering how bad he was until a month ago). But this ''he really tries'' and ''gives his all'' nonsense is cringe worthy. 

Trying is the bare minimum 99% of players do every game, it's hardly something he should be lauded for.

3702~~~
People on the caf always seem so narrow minded when speaking about Fellaini and I can't understand why. When you look at the way we played yesterday and the position he occupied to me I don't see how he can be slated as much as he is. 
Fellainis best attributes are his strength, workrate and heading abilities. 
Yet yesterday he was deployed seemingly as the playmaker for the team which I just think is ridiculous. There was times when we had players waiting up the pitch trying to find space and Fellaini was the one who was expected to thread the ball through which is blatant mis-management. If Fellaini is going to play then he needs to almost he used as a second striker, getting in the box whenever possible trying to disrupt the defence and have balls put into him. 
Now, it's obvious that this isn't the way we should ever be hoping to play, we're not a Tony Pulis side, thankfully. But it is a shame when people slate him for expecting him to be something he simply isn't. 
Fellaini should probably be replaced in the summer, and I'm sure one of the teams in mid table would actually pay a fair amount for him. But as for this season Fellaini is yet another damning example of unforgivable mis-management by Van Gaal.

3703~~~
The only problem with Fellaini is when he is played as a #6 or a #8 where ideally you want someone to pass the ball. If he is played further forward then he is a handful but would prefer someone better suited to our style of play up there at the same time.

3704~~~
'Unfortunately' the defending set-pieces point is a very good one, and I don't think we should understate the value of defending at set pieces - you won't win many games if you aren't doing it relatively well.  We've got Daley Blind playing at CB, remember.

In terms of 'balance' of the team & for the doing of this 'nasty stuff'  Fellaini is a (terrible pun follows) a big asset.

3705~~~
My old man is a United supporter. Been there from the Babes, all the way through to the present day. He despises Fellaini.

But yeah, glory hunting cnut of 2016 is what he is <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> As is anyone else who doesn't like him

3706~~~
Those two posters just expose their own lack of understanding of the game. With the way modern football is discussed, three is such a tendency for people to have a binary thought process about it. Players are either "quality" or pure trash.

3707~~~
His season is over.

3708~~~
Well at least they charged Huth too.

3709~~~
Aye, wondering if it will be 3 games for both or not really. Deserved nonetheless.

3710~~~
Not that bothered to be honest, he deserved it for the elbow, glad that Huth has also been charged , season over for both players.

3711~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Fellaini will be starting the final mate.

3712~~~
PL season I meant.

3713~~~
Depends how long his ban will be

3714~~~
The standard. 3 games.

3715~~~
thats a point , if he gets 3 matches , does that include the Final ?

3716~~~
We have three games left before the FA CUP ... He will play.

3717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> for some reason I thought we only had 2 games left this season.

3718~~~
No surprises. He needs to try and grasp the very basic concept that elbowing opposition players isn't allowed.

3719~~~
Hope we have seen the back of him. Isn't this the second time in two seasons that he has got himself sent off stupidly towards the end of the season? Such a burden

3720~~~
3 match ban, on the bench for the final, and then a parting of ways I think.

He's done exceptionally well to last 3 years here, but it's the end of the road now.

3721~~~
Mourinho will try and ship both. Pretty certain on that. Both have had best part of 3 years here, and neither have ever really hit the heights, although Mata did have a decent goal return for a while.

But with Rooney most likely to stay, we can't have such crippling lack of pace in there with him

3722~~~
I hope we make a frivolous appeal and he gets an extra game ban.

3723~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3724~~~
I hope the next manager would expect that all his players would know how to play football

3725~~~
We should loan him out to a mid table team. He'd likely take points off our rivals, with the bonus of us not having to face his elbows.

3726~~~
Why would you start him on the bench?

3727~~~
I'd want him on to mark Wickham at set pieces.

3728~~~
If you can't see him pulling his hair, why are you bothering to post on this thread?

Both deserve a 3 match ban for violent conduct. But as usual all eyes are on Fellaini.

3729~~~
The clue is in my post. I have only seen a clip where he pulls his hair at pretty much the exact time as the elbow. I was asking if there is something else I am missing which shows it was a clear retaliation. It's hardly as if Fellaini usually needs any kind of provocation to do something silly. If that is the hair pulling people are talking about, I am impressed with his lighting quick reactions, although annoyed that he has saved his first signs of speed for this moment.

3730~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3731~~~
Don't be silly, we have the aerial force that is Marcos Rojo to put on our oppositions big aerial threat...

3732~~~
To be honest and i can't believe i'm saying this but i would probably start him also (because palace are a big side).

But having said that after getting himself a stupid ban and missing the 3 games leading up to the final should he start the final?

3733~~~
Why does he deserve to start the biggest game of the season?

Generally. Let alone after this disgraceful behaviour?

3734~~~
Because he played a massive part in us getting to the final?

3735~~~
We have to field 11 players and 2/3 midfielders. Hard to come up with enough that fill that criteria.

He probably did more than any of our other midfielders to get us to that game.

3736~~~
I just think it's dodgy ground to let someone who has disgraced himself, stroll back in like he's Cantona or someone.
Most fans still think he's sh!t, and he could well be on his way in the summer.

3737~~~
I personally couldnt care less what most fans think. A lot of them are in denial, finding it hard to praise Fellaini when he has a good game because apparently he's not a United player - whatever one of those are. 

Fact is, as I said before, Fellaini has been vital to us getting to the final. If he's available, then he should play, in my opinion.

3738~~~
I get that perspective but I think winning a trophy is more important. I mean, he elbowed someone who pulled his hair, it wasn't like an unprovoked attack or anything. So while it was bad I would bring him in because I want to win. Palace will be a threat on set-pieces so he will help there and despite what many think he hasn't been any worse (better, if anything) than Herrera/Schneiderlin. He also seems to play quite well in 'big' games too.

3739~~~
Good on him.

3740~~~
Have we sold him yet?

3741~~~
Yes.

3742~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3577673/Manchester-United-s-Marouane-Fellaini-serial-offender-elbows-hope-never-plays-Premier-League-again.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ws-hope-never-plays-Premier-League-again.html</a>

Carragher <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. One of the most biased opinions I've read. Funny how he never said he would be happy to see Suarez never play in the Premier League again. To say that about Fellaini is a disgrace. I'd be happy to see him sold but to say Huth has been harshly treated is quite amusing. It would never have happened if he hadn't have grabbed a handful of Fellaini's hair.

3743~~~
I  actually agree with Carragher for the most part.

Fellaini's elbowing is disgraceful and he's going to do some serious damage to someone eventually, it's cowardly. He's also correct about Fellaini not being Utd standard, I know it's Carragher so most will automatically disagree with him but he's got it pretty spot on.

Apart from the Huth thing, just because he's part of the "fairytale" doesn't mean he should avoid punishment. Pulling hair is a cnuty thing to do anyway.

3744~~~
Jesus thank feck he's not playing so we can witness all of this fluent neat football.

3745~~~
Rather have him than Herrera any day. At least you know you'll get maximum effort at a minimum from him. 

Herrera can't run a game to save his life, so you're better of with Fellaini making tackles and winning the ball back to get us in a game.

3746~~~
Best game so far. This position suits him greatly

3747~~~
Man we look poor without him in the side. WTF?

He'll score the winner against palace!

3748~~~
Yep, we've definitely missed him more than Martial and Rashford. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3749~~~
I would be interested to see the stats for how many goals we concede from headers and set pieces with/without Fellaini in the team.

3750~~~
That's why I imagine he started in midfield last time against West Ham. Still you expect your defenders to be able to defend and not rely on an oaf to be in midfield.

3751~~~
Bad sign if we're that dependent on one rather average footballer to stop stupid goals like the ones we've conceded today. Then again, this has been a season of bad signs, so...

3752~~~
Perhaps, but amidst the current caf trend of "Fellaini is actually shit in the air" it is easy to forget that DEFENSIVELY he clears a hell of a lot of corners and FKs.

In an ideal world of course we would have two strong CBs for this, but with Blind as first choice this season I think that has definitely been a factor when considering Fellaini in midfield.

3753~~~
Oh he's definitely not shit in the air defensively. I think his strength is a huge asset there. I've always had doubts about Blind but he's done well in some games, but he's been massively exposed tonight. Hopefully he won't be at the back next season.

3754~~~
We just gift goals from set pieces. Until this is sorted he has to stay. We've been done so many times this season from headers it's unreal. We have no one to cross a ball to, or bother taking a corner kick for except him.

We're not Barcelona. We can't get away with it.

3755~~~
And to think I got slated by quite a few for defending Fellaini. He's more effective than many of those guys who played tonight.

3756~~~
Maybe if he wasn't dumb and ready to use his elbows all the time he might have had his use tonight!

3757~~~
This week's fan favorite, it seems. Enjoy it while it lasts Felli.

3758~~~
You'd fecking complain about him like you always do in here anyway.

3759~~~
LOL back to oh feck fellaini could have done better.

You could have barca team and they would still need some players who are beast in the air to defend against team like Westham in epl. 

But, yeah the dude is an idiot for missing the games out when we need everyone the most. Same shit with last season's ending.

3760~~~
West Ham wouldn't cause Barcelona any threat whatsoever. They wouldn't get corners and free kicks in daft positions we gave them.

Fellaini would of been sent off in a game like tonight's.

3761~~~
I said it in the matchday thread today, we missed him big time for tonight's match. There aren't many teams that Fellaini is good to use against but West Ham are certainly one of the teams that he's very useful against. His presence and ability to defend setpieces alone would have been a huge asset tonight. Not to mention he would have replaced Herrera in the lineup who had a complete nightmare performance.

3762~~~
Brainlessly got banned when for one of the first times ever in his United career we could have done with him starting.

It's quite incredibe how dumb we are as a team. I can imagine collectively we have one of the lowest IQs in the league.

3763~~~
Well they can dive and still will get some free kicks. It is not like Barca never gives any free kicks.

3764~~~
It really is, like the giving away free kicks tonight, Herrera and Valencia the main culprits. You know Mike Dean is going to be ready to blow for fouls, stay on your feet and don't dive in, yet they proceeded to do that every single time.

3765~~~
Just want to put it out there that Fellaini isn't just in the team because of defending set pieces. Yes, that's one of his attributes, but his aggression, ability to get from box to box, taking up of positions to help us beat the press are all attributes that are underrated, and we see the difference when he doesn't play.

3766~~~
I agree, but the only reason I bumped this thread (given he didnt play tonight) was to highlight that - not for the first time this season - we have looked incredibly vulnerable on set pieces and aerial balls into our box without Fellaini there.

3767~~~
Oh yeah, I agree. Post wasn't for you, it was just to point out to people that there's more to him than just his aerial presence. Of course that is a major attribute, though, and had he played tonight, I have no doubt he would have cut out a lot of those crosses. I just feel some people under-appreciate his other attributes, which has been key to us playing so well in recent weeks, in my opinion.

3768~~~
They drastically underrate them. For all the shit he cops he consistently delivers the same, if not better, performances than Herrera and Schneiderlin. Also, a lot of talk about the character of the players after the performance and the video on the bus, well Fellaini is one of the few members of the squad who actually has some character.

3769~~~
Yep. Noble was out there all fecking game going in hard on our players, and we just watched.

3770~~~
He certainly wouldnt have cowered away from the aggressive side especially with WH going into us really early. He was banned from this game cos of his own doing though.

3771~~~
No we didn't. We kept kicking them back in stupid areas. It's where 2 goals and a host of other near misses came from. 

This happened earlier in the season in a game Fellaini missed and we conceded from a set piece. And people said we need Fellaini so much for these set pieces, despite him conceding the most fouls in the squad and causing these set pieces. It's like a merry go round of total shitness with this team

3772~~~
Noble's tackles were hard and fair. Ours were soft and pointless.

3773~~~
He most likely would have got sent off in that game yesterday but atleast he would have shown some heart and fight in that midfield battle yesterday.

3774~~~
He doesn't really pick up that many yellows - and very few reds.

3775~~~
Is his ban carried over into the FA Cup final now? If the Bournemouth game isn't rearranged before then?

3776~~~
Good question! I'd imagine so.

3777~~~
The game should be rearranged before the F.A. Cup.

3778~~~
Really? I would've thought the rearranged game would have to be after the FA Cup final?

3779~~~
Fuming if this isn't sorted. Bullshit he can't play in the final.

3780~~~
You'd imagine we could get dispensation for him to play in the final if the rearranged match isn't scheduled until after. I'd be incredibly harsh for him to miss a cup final because of this. That said, I'm certain the game will be replayed this week anyway.

3781~~~
Am I the only one who doesnt give a toss if he plays in the final or not?

3782~~~
I don't want to see him in the final but I take solace in the fact that it will probably be his last game for United. Let the good times roll!

3783~~~
And suddenly the many knock on factors come into play!

Yes he'd be out if w don't get this game arranged. He'll be fretting. I think there'd be an outrage amongst other fans if he was "let off" and suspended for the other game. It's 3 matches in a row. If anything like today happens, that's hard luck surely is the rule.

3784~~~
You won't be the only one, no, but considering he was arguably our best player in the quarter and semi final, then I fail to see your reasoning behind not giving 'a toss' if he doesn't play.

3785~~~
No. Especially after the idiot got himself banned for the West Ham game, a rare game where we actually needed him! Now I hope he never plays for us again.

3786~~~
He was arguably not the best player. Stop it!

3787~~~
I didn't expect you to agree.

3788~~~
Not a United player for me but has more heart in him than some of the so called darlings in our team! Won't be gutted to see him on our bench next year rather than sold. There a few before him needing replaced first.

3789~~~
How some dont want him in the final is beyond me. I am not a Fellaini fan, far from it, but he is the only midfielder to put in a real shift and is useful in various roles. Good that the plays, the performances the last few weeks of some of our players were shameful.

3790~~~
Exactly, for now he does a job no one else in the team can.

Imagine the difference he could have made at West Ham when every single ball into the box caused us huge issues

3791~~~
He'll be available for the final, the Bournemouth game is officially on Tuesday at 8pm.

3792~~~
Now confirmed that the game will now be played on 17th May.

3793~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3794~~~
Doubt he'd have fouled as much as Herrera did too.

3795~~~
I'm pleased he's available for the final, I think he deserves to play given how he has quietened a lot of the moaners recently. Good on him!

3796~~~
Good news, deserves to start.

3797~~~
Good, I'm pleased he can play. And I never thought I would say that as I am not a huge Fellaini fan but the form of pretty much all of our other midfielders means we need him fit.

3798~~~
Our midfielders aren't in great form, but even if they were, Fellaini brings something completely different to all of them.

3799~~~
He must be massively relieved!

3800~~~
Was very good today. Surprised no one has mentioned him yet. Finished the season very well apart from the ban. We would have had champions league football if we had him available against West Ham. Well done Fellaini

3801~~~
He was not, missed easy chances and did not have much of an impact overall. He was average. His performance in the semi was better.

3802~~~
Played 120 minutes......

3803~~~
He did well again.

3804~~~
Thought he had a quiet game for a lot of it. Still got into some good positions and really unlucky not to score.

3805~~~
Did ok, felt he should have done better when he hit the bar but all in all not a bad performance. Still no where near good enough to be in the squad however and i hope not to see him next season.

3806~~~
I've seen him have better games, but again, he shown why he is, and has been, so important to us, especially against teams that play long balls. Made some crucial headers in both boxes, one of which created the equaliser for Mata.

3807~~~
Think he did well with that chance. Should have done better with the header in the first half.

Good performance. He's probably been one of the most important players in the run up to cup win.

3808~~~
Played very well IMO. Covered a lot of ground, good outlet but also defensively worked very hard to help out on the right side of midfield. A key player on this FA Cup run.

3809~~~
Done his bit today but it should be curtains after this season.

3810~~~
A fantastic performance from him, I thought. Got into some great positions and was constantly involved, winning the majority of his duels.

3811~~~
Did well today, I remember thinking he'd done well not to elbow anyone only for minutes later to get pulled up on it

3812~~~
TBH needed him against West Ham, we might have CL football too.

Will be surprised if hes a starter next season. Wont be surprised if hes kept around as a sub though for certain situations / teams.

3813~~~
Rubbish.  He adds  a unique dimension and is a very good option to have in our squad for specific circumstances and to allow for rotation.  Maybe not as 1st XI player but like he proved today, he has a key role to play.

Really hope Mourinho keeps him.

3814~~~
He didn't have his best game but he was probably one of our better performers. His actual midfield work could have been better but he was very important in both boxes.

3815~~~
We wouldn't have won the F.A cup without him in our team so fair play too him. One of the ones who actually shows some passion as well.

3816~~~
I am interested to see if Jose fancies him in some sort of role.

3817~~~
Great assist for the Mata goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3818~~~
So we keep a player who should be in his prime but is more of a situatonal player than anything. I'd replace him with a player that can adapt to many situations. He'll be going into his 4th,  all we can say is he is key for specific circumstances. Ok.

3819~~~
I wonder if Jose will rate him.

Were Chelsea not linked with him when Jose was there?

Edit - I'm convinced he will stay actually after more thought. He seems like one of the most popular players in the squad with his team mates, and I can see Mourinho bringing him on to close games out.

3820~~~
I guess most of us wouldn't want Fellaini starting as a general rule next season.

So my question is, do we keep him in the squad for those physical game's?

It gives us the plan B that teams like Arsenal/Liverpool don't have against teams like West Ham.

3821~~~
I'd sooner have a better plan B. Especially as Mourinho's plan A signings will likely mean physicality is less of an issue from here on.

3822~~~
He has his moment but I don't think he is useful in these games. He doesn't use his tools well. He just gets dirty and turns into a liability. I think he's actually a bit of a coward which is a shame.

3823~~~
"Plan B" ugh, shudder. He's just as good as a normal, vanilla, all-round footballer without humping the ball up to him constantly and being used as what the fans would like to say "Plan B". I think he will do well playing in the Lampard role where he gets free off of his man from the set #10 position and arrives in the box either in behind or ghosts in late. It will be similar to how to get the best out of Rooney. I'll not be surprised if he code-shares that role with Rooney next season.

Otherwise as an anchor in a 4-3-3 where he plays in a central defensive position and his duty is strictly defensive breaking-up of play. I am not sure Mourinho likes his box to box players playing from central midfield. I think he prefers them playing from further in the attacking third and covering the defensive end while having the freedom to be in the attacking third in-transition.

3824~~~
Unfortunately for him, he'll never win some people over but despite whatever you think of him as a football player, IMO was instrumental in the run in when we secured 4th spot and equally the FA cup. Big moments in both.

3825~~~
Has he actually been our best midfielder this season? I mean it's not hard as they've all been terrible but tallying up in my mind he's had as many good games as the rest. 

You could argue he's not really played midfield for some games though.

3826~~~
He's been our best player in the last three matches we played in the FA Cup. As some people have already mentioned,  was very instrumental in getting us the 4th position last season and now this. 

Still will be somehow rated less than Herrera who's been diabolical for the last three months.

3827~~~
That's being said you could certainly see the difference in the west ham replay compared to the league game when he was suspended.

3828~~~
Sorry do you see him as a regular starter under Mourinho KM?

3829~~~
People asked the same question when LVG replaced Moyes.

3830~~~
Useful player at times but still think he's not here for the long term, can't see Mourinho being a big fan.

3831~~~
I can certainly see Mourinho being a fan. Not a fan to start him, but definitely a fan to keep him. He has strong relationships with a fair few members of the squad and he has his uses in certain situations. I think Mou will prefer him over Herrera. Not sure about Schweinsteiger either, he's in such a weird position.

3832~~~
I've no clue as to what are Jose's plans are. I was just stating the influence Fellaini had on our FA Cup win.

3833~~~
I've never  really liked Fellaini, don't think he's good enough for Utd and I hope we sell him this Summer.

He was vital to us winning the FA Cup though, scored in the quarter finals, scored in the semi finals, and assisted the equaliser in the final. Thoroughly deserved his medal, be a nice way for him to say goodbye.

3834~~~
Oops that was supposed to be *so not *sorry. Stupid phone.

3835~~~
I will be honest, he has proved me wrong and I think he is useful. He doesn't fit the mold of the player type we want at United, but for me, I'd hope to have him accept my apology as he has come through several times for us this season. He's not perfect in any way, shape or form, but I appreciate his effort, and consider him a decent squad player, should we keep him.

3836~~~
Yeah, he's very useful in certain situations and is definitely underrated. Him missing for the West Ham game definitely contributed to our losing it, but it seems the various parts of our central midfield just don't complement each other optimally. LVG's philosophy didn't help as well. 

Given who is on the team and who is available, gotta think he'll be in Mou's plans. Carrick & Schweinsteiger will be moved on or de-emphasized and among Blind, Schneiderlin, Rooney, and Herrera, we lack a bit of physical brawn. Unless TFM is moved up to DM, we'll need a bit of physical presence at times that Fellaini provides. Not sure Mou will spend funds on a DM this window.

3837~~~
I can see Mourinho keeping him as an option. Bring him on when we want to see out a game, or stick him up front to bully a defender at some point... Jose loves to play on the edge with regard to a bit of gamesmanship, and I suspect he will love Fellaini in that capacity if nothing else.

3838~~~
I know he's a good option but I just really want him sold. It's an option that I would rather is not turn to really as it's just such a small time tactic 'lump it to the big man'. You wouldn't see Barca, Bayern or real messing around with a player like fellaini and he's just taking up the squad position of someone genuinely talented. All that being said he will most certainly stay under Mourinho who I reckon likes having options in the squad.Sigh...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3839~~~
The feeling I get is that many United fans are entertaining the idea of Fellaini simply because he has somehow signed for us and the best way to show that you are a true fan is to stick up for the one that isn't obviously good enough. One for all, all for one type nonsense. I wonder how many people would be excited by a tweet saying we are in for the next Fellaini? Or if we never bought him, how many people will say, let's get him, we would need him in games like the one at West Ham? The guy can only dance to one tune, and quite frankly, not many clubs play that tune anymore. Gone are the days when Stoke was the epitome of physical, long ball football, they now play pretty decent football on the ground. West Ham mostly resort to the long ball tactics when Carroll is fit, until then, it's all on the turf!

The fact that a player is as best regarded as a situational player is just ridiculous for a club like United. What is even worse is that, we used a 3 game run to justify him for the best part of 18 months. I don't hate the guy, I just think he needs to be let off the hook. The longer he is here, the more reasons we would have to resort to the same old tactic, which is just lazy IMO.  For his own good, it's curtains here!

3840~~~
<a class="username" data-user="74867, @dichinero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74867/">@dichinero</a> absolute nonsense bud.

3841~~~
Mourinho specifically went out his way to change Chelsea's team and put Zouma in midfield because of Fellaini. That goes to show how much of a threat he felt he was. Hopefully he keeps him because of that.

3842~~~
It's a matter of opinion. If we didn't have him, I doubt we would be crying out for a Fellaini, which is my point. And it's too easy and lazy to resort to Fellaini when things aren't going so well for the team. Our last two managers have been very reactive instead of being proactive, and the inclusion of Fellaini is mostly reactive IMO. Like I said, it is a matter of opinion. One odd good game every month is not good enough, to keep a player as an "option" when he should be in the prime of his career. A player of his experience should offer more than just unique options.

Good point. But the moment Fellaini was easily nullified, the whole team were in shambles. There is no plan B when he is on the pitch and it showed for the next three games in that sequence when we lost 3 in a row IIRC (A sequence of games that is conveniently removed from discussions). Can we truly afford to build a tactic around one player that isn't a world class player? Unless you are Messi or Ronaldo, as far as the highest standards are concerned.

3843~~~
96 posts that are mostly around the same, boring and idiotic lines in this thread, mere fact that I managed to get him on ignore because of the same agenda bullshit that he managed to peddle in the match threads (so when he was still in the newbs) suggest that indeed he might talk utter shite.

3844~~~
Seems like you really enjoy keeping tabs on me. Want me to post another to help with your Monday blues?

3845~~~
If you categorise Fellaini purely as "hey this guy is pretty tall and can chest a ball well" then sure. In my view however, Fellaini contributes well as a box-to-box player, he has a winning mentality, adds physicality and workrate to the midfield. Just because he isnt a playmaker doesnt mean it is right to neglect his other qualities.

Is that Fellaini's fault or the managers?
Moreso, nobody is suggesting that we build a team around Fellaini, but rather that he is a good option to have in the squad and has generally done well when called upon.

3846~~~
Is that a way of saying Fellaini was our most important player? 

How is that Fellaini's fault, though? He can only do what he does on the pitch. If he's marked out the game, which, at times he will be, then it's up to our other players to turn up.

3847~~~
I'm in no way laying the blame on the guy. It's just that he comes across as a player that managers seem to have difficulty to nail down a role or position. I believe he is a hardworking player that gives what he can. Unless Jose can bring out the best of Fellaini, I fear that it might be another struggle. Moyes, Wilmots and LvG have all used him in different capacities and he needs to nail down a role. In the last 3 years, he's been deployed as a #6,8,10,9,9.5. 

My point is that, Fellaini just being an option isn't good enough. He should be starting giving his experience but what role and tactic that would be consistent is my point! If that makes sense.

3848~~~
Yes, he was the most important player IMO. But because his limited or should I say specific skill set, it almost means that when is the key player in whatever tactic, there is hardly any flexibility when he is nullified. Yes, it's also down to the manager but to a degree his "limitations" make it difficult to mix it up when things aren't going according to plan.

3849~~~
Mourinho will love Fellaini and use him wherever he can.

He is your Heskey - An indispensible asset to the preferred approach and simultaneously emblematic of all the shortcomings of that approach.

3850~~~
I can imagine him throwing Fellaini up front in the last 5-10 minutes if we're losing a game, like he used to do with Huth at Chelsea and Materazzi at Inter.

3851~~~
Which is exactly how he should be used. He's a game changer, rather than a game maker.

3852~~~
I think Mourinho will sell Fellaini.

3853~~~
He'll do that with Smalling then. Waste of a squad spot and his quality by using him specifically for a last resort role. That's when you send the center halves up.

3854~~~
With Zlatan coming there's very little point of Fellaini.

All Fellaini is useful because of his height. So no more putting him up front now with Zlatan arriving. He is not a player Jose would want in midfield.

3855~~~
Zlatan is 1.95m and should help defending set pieces, Eric Bailly is 1.87m, fast and physical. For all his height and headings, Fellaini didn't score or assist that many goals, and not much came from all the balls he won in midfield. He was most useful in our defence!, defending set pieces. Fellaini got 4 goals and 1 assist in 1457 minutes. Not too good.

3856~~~
How many did Cack get?

3857~~~
We live in hope

3858~~~
That's just your wishful thinking.

3859~~~
I think Mourinho will like a player like Fellaini in the squad, especially if we play with a 433, with two centre midfielders ahead of a holding midfielder.

As I said before, if a manager goes out his way to specifically change his tactics and team, in order to try and nullify a player, then you know they must be a threat. Those are the sort of tactics used with Messi, Ronaldo, Pirlo, Alonso, etc. Now, I'm not trying to put Fellaini in that bracket, but he has a very unique skill set, and is very difficult to mark if used correctly.


I disagree. Fellaini, in my opinion, gives more than just his height. He's aggressive, powerful, strong, gets up and down the pitch, presses well, gets stuck in, provides an attacking threat and gets his fair share of goals.

Having said all of that, the more height we have in our team the better.

3860~~~
Hopefully the addition of Ibra, Bailly and a CM with some height will see the end of him, there's no player I have hated seeing more in a United shirt.

3861~~~
I quite like Fellaini despite his nastiness. i think he is a useful option to have in the squad, he works hard, provides a threat and is not one who will complain if he is not starting week in week out. Having said that, I wouldn't mind if he was sold either but I certainly have no problem with him staying. New manager, new system and I am all for giving some players a chance to show how they can contribute.

3862~~~
There's also no player you've probably hated that won you the FA cup.

3863~~~
What's Jesse Lingard go to do with it?

3864~~~
He's just a disgusting footballer who has one decent skill: chesting the ball. Everything else he does either mediocrely or poorly. Plus he's a fecking dirty, stupid looking bastard. God I hope we get rid of him. He's a symbol of everything that has been wrong post Fergie. How this fecking clown ended up at Manchester United, I will never know.

3865~~~
I'm really hoping he's sold as we just have to do better than fellaini

3866~~~
My sentiments exactly. Absolutely embarrassing to have him anywhere near the squad.

3867~~~
I wouldn't like to see him playing against us again, the dirty, clumsy, awkward to play against individual that he is.

3868~~~
How similar do we think Fellaini is to Matic?

I guess Mourinho could see him in that role with a good passer (ala Fabregas) alongside him. We'd have Carrick/Bastian/Maybe Rooney to go alongside him. And then 3 playmakers ahead of them.

3869~~~
What happened? Did he shit in your cereal or something?

3870~~~
People said the same three years ago when I told you guys there would be no fabregas and that it would be Fellaini on deadline day just after his release clause expired.

Fellaini is like stepping on a turd when you are late. He will keep sticking to your shoe until you arrive and have time to clean it. For now, the pressure to get there isn't off yet. 

He's a safety cushion for managers. They love him.

3871~~~
I said that hecwas shit about two weeks after he joined. People hated me for saying so.

3872~~~
He just agile or fast enough to play in a Jose team as an attacking midfielder or box to box midfielder.

The PL is basically all about rushing the ball up the pitch as quick as you can. Jose teams are brilliant at that. Hence him and probably Mata will be leaving.

If Jose wants a plan B he will have Zlatan. At 6F5 he will be looking down on pretty much every CB in the PL.

3873~~~
Not similar at all. Matic is very mobile, a good tackler, can read the play well and has a decent short passing range.

Fellaini is an awkward number 10 who can make things difficult for the opposition. He'd be perfect for Pulis at West Brom.

3874~~~
Fellaini ticks almost all of those boxes and offers far, far more in attack than Matic.

3875~~~
If Fellaini was any good at tackling and reading the game, he would have cemented himself as a defensive midfielder ages ago.

He also doesn't have enough skill and vision to offer far far more in attack than anyone.

3876~~~
Will always divide opinions. For me, I rather have him than have to play against him. Also for the last two seasons deployed in different ways, he was instrumental in the end of both seasons in us making top 4 last year and this year vital goals in the cup run and contribution in the final. Ever team needs a player that's a bit of a c**t and he's ours.

3877~~~
Given we are in the Fellaini thread this will fall on deaf ears, but 'skill and vision' are not the only ways a player can contribute.

3878~~~
Agree and any Utd fan could look down the ages and see many a Felllaini type wearing a red shirt.

3879~~~
Fellaini is terribly immobile, he has poor concentration (regularly loses midfield runners), has very poor short passing and is awful at reading the game.

It'd be like comparing Heskey with Schneiderlin. Totally different players in totally different positions with totally different skill-sets.

Fellini is not, nor will he ever be a defensively minded central midfielder. We bought him in the back of a good season as a productive nuisance in the number 10 position.

He's a £20m focal point at a mid table team in the number 10 position. He's a relegation standard defensive midfielder.

3880~~~
FFS, swore I wasn't going to post in this thread. But come on now, Fellaini can't do what Matić did for Chelsea under Mourinho (for the most part until the collective meltdown last season). The latter operated as the foil for the defense, has great positional sense, seems like someone with natural defensive nous, reads the game well, and was the glue that held the team together while Cesc roved forward when they won the title.

At one point he was the leading tackler + interceptor in the league (ahead of Schneiderlin at Southampton):
He was key to their passing from deep - frequently instigating counter-attack, recycled the ball well, was incredibly mobile for a man of his stature evidenced by his dribbling into space in effortless fashion (completed 43 of 53 dribbles), and extinguished dangerous opposition moves.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TyZlXqRBPnM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Marouane is ill-suited for the deepest midfield role - one that places a great burden on him, in terms of positioning, clean tackling ability, and 'vacuuming' the clutter. Weird comparison - but Matić is a bit like Thiago Motta at his peak for PSG - someone who keeps the engine purring smoothly, and does most of the dirty work silently.

That's far removed from Fellaini's best role - he is more of someone who does his best work in the transition to the final third, or further up. It's not a coincidence that his best season at Everton came as a #10 of sorts, and that has also been his best role at United - as the left sided box-to-box to switched to a #10, not as a holding midfielder like Matić. Above all else, he doesn't have the discipline or defensive intuition to do justice to that pivotal role.

3881~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> to avoid any confusion, I was not trying to claim that Fellaini could do 'the Matic role' (not sure if your post was aimed at me).

<a class="username" data-user="52832, @finneh" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52832/">@finneh</a> your assessment is harsh. Fellaini being immobile is a lazy myth used by his critics - when he is deployed properly as part of a 3-man midfield (i.e. 4-3-3, when we have played our best football over the last two years) he gets up and down the pitch extremely well and operates very much as a box to box player.
His passing - short or otherwise - is obviously not one of his strengths but nor is it as bad as being made out. As I said before there are other ways a player can contribute as a midfielder than being a Paul Scholes or Xavi spraying 60 yard passes out every thirty seconds.

Again I am not trying to claim he is a defensive midfielder - his best role by far at United has been in a midfield three with a holding player such as Carrick behind him. Fellaini - along with Herrera and Rooney - thrives in that role when given the license and freedom to get up and down the pitch. In my eyes that is the formation we should be persisting with, but unfortunately Jose has always tended to go for a 4-2-3-1 which does not leave a natural role for any of the players just mentioned.

3882~~~
Just for the record I was only asking the question, not stating my belief. Very comprehensive answer. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3883~~~
Who, for example? I literally can't think of anyone

3884~~~
Nah, it's just that I saw Matić being mentioned here and jumped the gun a bit. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3885~~~
Fellaini being immobile is definitely not a myth. We've conceded several times because he allows the opposition runner to ghost past him. He'll regularly be slowly jogging not noticing a player accelerating past him. Whether this is him being immobile, lazy or just plain undisciplined is anyone's guess (my view is a combination of the three).

He played very well for 4-5 games whereby Van Gaal played him in an advanced midfield position where we played against teams that attacked us. In this system we bypassed our midfield and used him as a target man between midfield and attack. This was a very limited role that soon got found out by simply putting a big man on him (Zouma). Personally I don't think United should be playing this style of long ball, predictable Football that is easy to stifle (unless it's a couple of times a season to take an opposition by surprise).

Again his best position, as evidenced by his form at Everton is the middle of the 3 in a 4-2-3-1 or the first 1 in a 4-4-1-1 (in a long ball system). In either of these positions we have several player's who're either better or far better suited to a top team than Fellaini (Inc Mata, Januzaj, Rooney, Lingard, Herrera). That's before any other signings this Summer.

If he stays it should be as a plan B who's brought on in the last 20 mins to try and bulldose teams whereby scoring from playing actual Football isn't working.

3886~~~
If there was no Fellaini, we wouldn't be winning the FA cup.

3887~~~
Bold part is proof you haven't followed his career enough. Watch some of his games in midfield for Everton - yes midfield, not number 10. His long pass may not be something special but his short passing is really good. 

Most people on this forum have made their minds up on Fellaini. Any good performance he has is just luck, a one off, ugly or just poor credited to poor opposition. He has been valuable for us this past season and thankfully most pundits/experts recognize this.

3888~~~
Total nonsense.

Iniesta's short passing is really good; Xavi's short passing was really good; Scholes' short passing was really good... Hell I could name 7-8 player's in the United squad which you could classify as anything from decent to good. Fellaini wouldn't be one of them. Unless our standards have lowered to such a level where Fellaini's short passing is really good, Rooney's short passing is likewise and Rojo's defending is really solid. 

I've watched him many times for Everton and over 80 times for United. His game is based around the fact that he's a massive nuisance to defenders and can control the ball from nearly 6 feet in the air with his chest, which is particularly useful in a system where you're looking to bypass midfield (usually a tactic employed by a smaller team, particularly when they're not favourite to win). These along with his defensive heading and physicality are his strengths. His weaknesses include his discipline, short passing, long passing, close control, technique, ball control, pace, stamina, concentration, positional play, an inability to keep the ball when pressed and strangely enough given his height: attacking headers.

In short he has no qualities apart from his size that suit him playing in the middle third of the pitch.

What? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I am not sure he is even better in attack tbf, despite playing as a striker at times. He scored just 3 goals this season and was terrible in front of goal missing some big chances. Matic is much more positive passer than him, Fellaini just lays the ball off majority of times. But they aren't playing same position anyway so it's stupid comparing them in attack, but in terms of those "boxes" Fellaini is worse at pretty much every one, because all those things he mentioned are Fellaini's weaknesses.

3890~~~
If there was no Rashford or Martial is more like it, this is silly mate.

3891~~~
Fellaini is a player we never needed and should never have bought, but he did put in 4 or 5 solid performances in his three seasons at Old Trafford.  He should be sold to another club who could use his battering ram qualities.

3892~~~
He's done phenomenally well then to have rated 7 places higher (among Utd players) than Carrick in whoscored's overall ratings for the EPL season, not to mention being a consistent starter for the 2nd highest ranked national team - considering that list of weaknesses. I mention Carrick because he seems to get as much bias in his favour on here as there is against Fellaini.

3893~~~
They we both not good enough last season

3894~~~
True. Fellaini was better than Carrick though.

3895~~~
He's not a defensive midfielder, he's not a title challenging club no.10. He's a useful player who has his moments, but there's a reason he was considered brilliant at Everton and mediocre at United.

I don't even think Sir Alex would've been able to do much with him.

3896~~~
He's rated at 5.1 this season. The lowest average rating for any player who's played more than a handful of games. Use your eyes, not some arbitrary scoring website.

Not to mention that Carrick's been very poor too so he's not exactly the beacon of quality.

3897~~~
Don't whoscored use pointless indicators such as 'Aerial Duels' and 'Clearances' towards their shitty rating system? Like the bloke is genuinely great at jumping higher than others and getting his head on the ball, I'll give him that.

I mean according to this rating system, Fellaini gives the ball away 21% of the time. And we have people discussing potential roles in a deeper role where play starts.

3898~~~
"arbitrary scoring website"? whoscored.com? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
So where's this 5.1 from? Here?
whoscored uses stats. Here there are a lot of people with an agenda against him.

3899~~~
Where'd you get that?

3901~~~
OK. Thanks. I had been looking at the entire squad list, with the default display for the EPL, so was seeing the 83.6% figure. Still not great, btw.

3902~~~
Yes an arbitrary stat site that rates player's on stats that can be padded by doing arbitrary things, such as playing it safe meaning you get a great pass completion %.

Watch football with your eyes and you'll see why he's the worst rated player on this forum.

3903~~~
He at least tries. Which is more than what can be said of Herrera Carrick and all this season. He can be a real asset most of the time he plays. He is not world class or something but he is hardly the nothing player that is being described here. It's quite possible that he will be retained by mourinho.

3904~~~
People here would give him a 6 maybe even if he has an amazing game. Someone like Smalling or Herrera would get a 5 even if they were useless that game

3905~~~
How does one measure that Fellaini "still tries" but conclude that Herrera doesn't. If anything Herrera plays like he runs himself into the ground,  chasing in attack and defense,  although often leading to misplaced passes and mistimed tackles. It may not work but you can't say he doesn't try as an argument to justify Fellaini,  which is a common comment tbf. A more physically imposing player will always look like they try more when they win more physical challenges that slighter players can't win. Personally I think he tries but not as hard as people say.

3906~~~
Oh I can see why he's (one of) the worst rated player(s) here. Don't worry about that. I'm seeing it right now. It's people like you that would consistently mark him down in order to further their agenda. Whoscored don't do that. If anyone can be accused of "playing it safe" to get great PS% it's Carrick. His stats aren't even all that great anymore and yet he still has people on here and other forums hailing him as "still our best midfielder" ffs. There are opinions and there are stats. Stats are less likely to be unfair.

3907~~~
Because Fellaini Attempts to get the ball forward quite a lot. He isn't just a physical player but also can contribute to our attack. Herrera goes anonymous in a lot of games for my liking.

3908~~~
I kinda disagree with this. Fellaini's forward passes are usually nothing more than passes to a player a few yards ahead,  and mostly not in a position to be a direct that to the opposition. Herrera does try a lot of forward and attempts a lot of creative passes but unfortunately it doesn't come off,  a lot of time because a few players alongside Mata just remain static and rigid according to LvG's system. Just because Fellaini is in a higher position to affect the scoreline more than the one Herrera or other players occupy,  it doesn't make him less anonymous than others,  even if he just pops up with a goal in the 90th min after 89th min of anonymity.

3909~~~
Quite strange how a few thousand people just seem to randomly have an agenda against him, despite him consistently putting in good performances and contributing so much to the team. It's as if the vast majority of the people on this forum don't actually watch him every week and want United to win, an activity that would clearly make them warm to him because of said performances, but instead are all strangely prejudiced against afro-haired Belgiums. Yep, that's definitely it.

Carrick has also been very poor by the way, along with Memphis and Fellaini they make up the worst 3 player's who've played more than a few games. Strange that Carrick and Memphis has been agreeably terrible this year, but poor old Fellaini is the victim.

3910~~~
Here are the whoscored overall ratings of our (outfield) players that played over 1000 minutes in the EPL season just gone:

1 Martial 7.23
2 Smalling 7.17
3 Blind 7.14
4 Rooney 7.06
5 Rojo 6.93
6 Scneiderlin 6.92
7 Darmian 6.91
8 Mata 6.8
9 Fellaini 6.78
10 Schweinsteiger 6.78
11 Herrera 6.77
12 Lingard 6.71
13 Carrick 6.66
14 Young 6.6
15 Memphis 6.38

If caftards' opinions were anything like fair, there is no way Fellaini should be rated much lower than any of those with poorer stats than him. So yes, I do believe that there are many here who mark him low for reasons unconnected to what he does on the pitch - as in, they've taken an irrational dislike to him - for whatever reason.

Incidentally, many on that list would, I believe, have better stats and would have been marked higher here (and we would be in CL), had they played in their natural positions - Blind, Rooney, Rojo, Mata and Young included.

3911~~~
When did whoscored ratings become such a concrete way of rating players?

3912~~~
Its weird, because they're absolute junk as well.

3913~~~
That list proves my point completely. Darmian on the whole has been very poor, yet is rated higher than Mata. Rojo has been poor yet he's rated higher than Lingard, Schweinsteiger or Mata. Fellaini likewise has been awful and is rated as decent. Rooney likewise hasn't been close to one of our best player's, yet he's near the top. Schneiderlin likewise.

The Redcafe ratings are far, far more objective and fair than that list. Which is obvious because the posters here watch the vast majority of games.

Very few United fans randomly despis a player without basis. They form the opinion by watching thousands of minutes of them play. People rate Fellaini down because he's been useless for us in 95% of his games.

3914~~~
There you go again. He's quite obviously not among "the worst 3 players". How would you account for all of those with worse stats than him if that was true?

3915~~~
At least put off sub appearances when comparing ratings <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

3916~~~
Fair point. Most of those ranked low had more sub appearances.

3917~~~
Fellaini is not good enough to be a regular undoubtedly. But there's no denying his awkward demeanour makes him disliked much more than others among fans. Similarly Herrera and Mata gets a lot more leeway although they have been proper gash for most part of their united career. Especially herrera who has gotten only worse and looks lost and does the stupidest of things in his limited time on the field. Mata is another fair weather softie who gets away due to an occasional show of flair and mostly being this nice guy. In the end all 3 are disappointingly poor thus far. But the hate is a lot more skewed towards one.

3918~~~
Agree that Fellaini's style of play probably sees him get criticised more that other players who contribute about as much (or as little). I don't <i>necessarily</i> think that's unfair though. Manchester United fans expect to see a certain style of football and don't see Fellaini as being particularly compatible with that. It would be the same at other clubs.

3919~~~
Herrera playing this season made me wonder if he actually has brains. Fellaini seemed more intelligent with his crap than him. Giving away needless fouls in dangerous areas , giving away the ball etc. 

People give him lower ratings because of the hatred they have towards him. If he has a bad game he would be rated Lower than say Smalling or Herrera or mata in their off days. It's obvious.

3920~~~
Why do you think they hate him?

3921~~~
Hardly an argument to be fair, this place has gone through many seasons where certain players are blamed logical or not. 

Fellaini hasn't done enough to win people round from their initial assessments, fair enough as he's been poor as much as he's been good and most of the time average. Still, I'd say he's had as many good games as any other midfielder this season hasn't he?

3922~~~
Those players don't just have good short passing -- their short passing is world class. Fellaini's short passing is as good as say Cleverley's or any other average top 8 premier league midfielder. You said he has very poor short passing which just proves you haven't seen enough of him. 

Fellaini has other weaknesses, and you mentioned some of them which I agree with but the last part of your post just proves you don't see what he brings to the team. Especially If you think he has no qualities apart from his size. That's ridiculous.

Because of his size, many have just made this image of Fellaini being a useless lump with no strengths but his size. To anyone who believe this myth, why don't you just watch the goals he has scored and the manner in which he has scored them let alone analyzing his whole game.

3923~~~
I feel Many hate him just because it reminds them of Moyes and that transfer window. For instance guys like buttner Bebe and all were in our squad for couple of years and Fellaini is a better player than them but have a poll between Fellaini and buttner and it will be buttner all the way.

3924~~~
Because in order to get any use out of you we need to adapt our style or play to suit him, and that football is ugly. You put him in a standard midifeld and he's next to useless, his passing is terrible, he has no positional sense and he isn't exactly mobile. If you play long or diagonal balls up to him in and around the box he's very good, no one wants to see us do that though.

3925~~~
Neither united nor moyes at Everton played long balls. In fact we played our most attacking and best football in 2 years with LvG using Fellaini in midfield. We never went long ball tactics

78.9% passing stat would be good if he made more assists but the only assists I remember are penalty area knockdowns. Even those, only one or two a season. At #6 I'd prefer a DCM who can pass fluently. At #8 I'd want someone like Pogba or Pjanic; a genuine goal threat. At #10, either a proper <i>creative</i> #10, or a striker/#10 (like Zlatan). I don't see how Fellaini is worth his squad number.

3935~~~
Which particular matches are you talking about?

3936~~~
I'm just watching SSN.

What just came on reads:

3937~~~
To be fair he was quite inconspicuous before...

3938~~~
He deserves selling on the basis of that hair alone

3939~~~
Game vs Spurs Liverpool and all last season

3940~~~
He was one of our top 5 players last season. 

Say what you want about him 'not being a United player' but he has put in some big performances despite the home crowd being against him whilst others who are given the benefit of the doubt cowered and waited for van Gaal to be sacked.

3941~~~
I always wondered, does his hair grow? is it stunted or does he meticulously pamper and cut it to let it stay exactly like that.

3942~~~
Fellaini: ''I wonder how i could make myself look like even more of a clown than i already do? Oh i know i'll bleach my big silly looking afro blond, that'll do it.''

3943~~~
A combination of atomic mushroom cloud and Harpo Marx.

3944~~~
I actually think Fellani's ball playing technical ability to be decent. There are many times where his size AND touch gets the team out of difficult situations (where we're being pressed) etc. He's more than capable of being a decent squad player for Utd at this time and moment (unless we decide to sign 3 world class midfielders in the Summer). I just think LVG's tactics and Fellani's insistence on following to the rule to be both their triumph and downfall.

3945~~~
I'm not talking about the forum but people in social media like Twitter, sportbible and etc are being too much about Fellini's new hair. It's his own hair and he can do what he likes.  The reaction is actually worse than Jones's.

3946~~~
I'd keep him for next year and see if he can develop further under Mourinho. For me, he has been our best midfielder for the last two seasons which highlights our lack of a world class CM more than Fellaini's ability admittedly. Herrera had a good first season, but wasn't consistent enough and didn't build on that at all last season. Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger were both underwhelming. 

He has his weaknesses, he can't read the game well and lets attackers just drift by him but if used correctly then he can be a threat and a decent enough player.

3947~~~
I strongly recommend never browsing through any social media comments re: United (or anything really). It's 100% shite, there's no proper debate.

3948~~~
But I feel sorry about him for getting such abuse or sh** in social media. It's only about hair. Jones did the same thing but Fellaini received more sh**

3949~~~
I'm pretty sure no famous footballer reads comments under their posts, it's filled with rival fans using abusive language etc. Quite a lot of footballers and other celebrities don't even run their own accounts but have "employees" doing it for them.

I think Gibson opened and closed his instagram(?) account pretty quickly due to United "fans" filling it with abuse. So Felli's probably not hurt as he's clever enough not to read the comments. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3950~~~
You can avoid to read them but you can still see the comments from notification.

3951~~~
Maybe he's putting off clubs buying him so he can stay?

3952~~~
Sorry, a bit late on this. Not really that similar, I think Matic has a much better offensive skillset to go with the defensive one. I think I would avoid playing Fellaini in the "in between" role of #8 because he tends to roam forward and then stay forward, but also only offer a single type of attacking link-up play when he is deeper and before the transition, a little pass off and move forward. Matic can play further forward and also anchor the role while playing from the same starting position, I don't think Fellaini has that in his game.

If you put him at the base of a 4-3-3 to anchor the midfield he's perfectly capable of playing a limited defensive role. He did that for Liege when he was a lot more mobile, he did it for a long time under Moyes as well. You won't get incredible playmaking skills though.

Unless you have a setup like the NT setup that allows Fellaini to play #8 then I wouldn't play him as part of a midfield two without support. I don't think it would work in the PL like it does at NT level.

3953~~~
Puting the blond die aside, Why is his natural hair being described as 'silly'. Not calling you out per se, it's something I've witnessed and experienced myself. I mean Ramsey died his hair too, didn't hear anyone call his straight short hair "silly".

3954~~~
No ones natural hair is silly not even Fellaini's. But when you choose to grow it into a style synonymous with clowns (see below) then it's easy to see why lots of people think his hair looks silly. Because well it does look silly which is why it's a popular look for clowns.


Theres nothing wrong with him having an afro if thats how he wants to look fair play to him, but he's been complaining for years that he gets unfair treatment from referees and and mockery from fans because of how he looks. So he has two options cut his hair or just accept people will always view him a certain way and judge him because of his hair style and stop complaining about it.

3955~~~
And so he should. Tbh your whole response is contradictory to me. So there's "nothing wrong" with an afro.... but he should "cut his hair" so people don't abuse him ??.<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

And since when were Afros synonymous with clowns? Black people have been sporting afros since dawn of man. The fact that you compared his hair to a clown and labelled it as silly is exactly the point I was coming against. Imagine being automatically undermined and judged just because of features you have that are particular to your race. Some may even call that racism.

I've known people who have been labelled as unprofessional at work because they had an afro. What most people don't realise is that an afro is not just a hairstyle we put on in the morning; it's something you're born with, hence the term 'grow an afro'!

3956~~~
Very strange the agenda a lot of fans seem to have towards the big fella. It's like they are praying for him to fail at the club. They just call him shit and refuse to accept that a Man Utd. and Belgium international is a good player. Thought he has handled himself superbly through all the bad and good times performance and fan abuse wise...would have been easy to react differently. Been supporting for 20 years and can't really remember a similar situation with any other player. 

The fact is he was better than our "star" midfielders last year. Schneiderlin, Herrera, Memphis were just terrible. Carrick was alright...Wayne was infuriating during the first half 2/3 of the season and started to play well last 1/3. He was very important for us. 

Also, I've never seen a Utd team so spineless, its absurd. He takes it too far sometimes but I love it that Fellaini actually puts himself about and let's people know he's there. Really only feel that way about Valencia, and maybe Shaw. For fecks sake Mark Noble picked up Ander Herrera and carried him off the pitch. Still can't get over how bad that was. Would love to know everyone else's opinion about that because i think it says a lot about the squad's character. 

Basically, there's no downside of keeping him as a squad player. There's really no player like him and he is very hard to deal with for opposition defenses.

3957~~~
I completely agreee with your assessment of fellaini he mostly gets rough deal around here his poor performances are magnified and good performances basically get ignored. He may not be first team  option at the club like United but certainly has his uses as  a squad member . Our midfield options are quite underwhelming anyway most of them would end up either being sold or as squad players once Mourinho reshapes this squad to his liking.

3958~~~
When we had that bad december, Fellaini could have been the difference. In a handful of games, he was inches from scoring but the ball wouldn't go in for him. To me he's not a problem. He's also liked in the dressing room. Martials said in the past he's a friend, we shouldn't think to sell him. There's lots of myths. Like he slows us down or that we can't play good football with him. We can and we have seen good performances. It's a pity he missed those chances but at the same time - it's an exciting period for the club. It's difficult to know what will happen.

3959~~~
To be fair mate i'm not saying he should cut his hair, i said he has been complaining for years that he is targeted by refs and mocked by fans because of his hair. I don't even know for sure if that is true it might be and he seems to think it is the case. So if his theory is correct but he doesn't want to cut his hair thats fine and his right but then in that case the world isn't going to change just because he made that decision, there are lots of people who will always view him a certain way because of his appearance.

Listen mate we're talking about someones hair here, if he had a mullet most people myself included would view it as just as silly. So lets not create racism where there is none shall we.

Also when have afros been associated with clown? Well how long have clowns wore those wigs to make them selves look funny? I didn't create that situation, type clown wig into google image search and i would wager most of the results are clowns with afro wigs. More often than not when you see a clown they are wearing one of those wigs, they wear them because they look comical i suspect. So after decades of people seeing clowns wearing those wigs rightly or wrongly when they see someone who has a similar hairstyle either consciously or subconsciously they will think clown.

I get what you're saying mate but if the majority people regardless of race grew their hair out and/or didn't maintain it then it would most likely look equally silly would it not. It's nothing to do with race and everything to do with having big hair which to most people looks a bit silly, white people and probably people of other races can grow afro's too.

3960~~~
I absolutely agree with all of the above. They way Fellaini is vilified by United fans, both in this forum and at Old Trafford, is atrocious. He carries the United spirit, never hides, and has been excellent for us last season.

3961~~~
You still aren't getting my point but I don't want to turn the Fellaini thread into a discussion about hair, and racial identity. All I'll say is an afro is <b>not</b> a hair style (like a mullet or mo-hawk or skinhead) and white people certainly cannot grow one!! For most black people, when their hair grows, it naturally forms an afro. So for anyone to call that silly or attribute it to clowning, to me is a form of discrimination and i've witnessed that in real life. Talking of clowns, performers at minstrel shows often wore afro wigs (and blackface) to mock black people.

3962~~~
Whatever way someone keeps their hair is a style mate if i didn't cut my hair for 3 years and let it grow down past my knees that would be a style and it would look even sillier than Fellaini's. Because growing your hair out is a choice it's how you want to look. Honestly mate we are getting into the realms of nonsense here over one throwaway comment about someones fecking hair style.

Come on now, lets not get drag this nonsense out. I'm not getting into a fecking discussion about what constitutes an afro. These guys below are white and they have hair styles that are to me similar to Fellaini's and they look equally as silly.





Honestly mate as someone who has been subjected to discrimination and sectarianism in my life and who has nieces and a nephew who are mixed race. For you to basically imply that i am racially discriminating against someone because i think their hair looks silly is unbelievable. I would appreciate an apology for that, because you have went too far there mate. You don't know me as a person, if i think someones hair looks silly that is that. Visually to me it looks silly there's no racial prejudice behind it.

If you have anything more to say to me beyond an apology please do so in PM because this is not the place to discuss matters like this.

3963~~~
I don't think I was implying you were racist. That was never my intention so apologies if it came across that way. My whole point in this back-and forth was to highlight how the comment you made could be construed as being discriminatory based on real life experiences. I'm black and I've had an afro in the past, my sisters still do, as well as some close friends. I'm not bringing this up just to 1-up you on who is "more black", but it's your refusal to acknowledge my point and insisting that afros are simply a choice, thus just a silly hair style worn by clowns is why. Essentially you were dismissing my family, other black people and evidently gingers as clowns because the way their hair grows. I hope you understand why I felt the need to say something.

3964~~~
Cheers mate fair enough. Listen with my original comment about his hair looking silly and every reply since in this conversation it hasn't been my goal to be offensive or offend anyone. If you felt that i was please understand that wasn't my intention.

To be honest i don't even know if Fellaini is considered black (is he?), that may just be because of ignorance on my part. His hair style to me has never been something i associate only with black people, as i have seen people of different races with similar. So racial connotations never crossed my mind when i made fun of his hair.

Look i honestly only brought clowns into the debate not to compare black people or any other race (or even gingers, my wife is ginger) to clowns, but simply to highlight why some people might think Fellaini's hair looks silly. My reasoning was that clowns most likely wear hair like that because it makes them look a bit silly (i now know there may be other more sinister historical reasons). I accept it was a bad example to use for the point i was trying to make and i can now see why you misconstrued what i was trying to say. Again i didn't mean to cause offence to anyone.

Theres a whole other debate to be had at another time and place which you touched upon earlier, as to the true origins of why clowns wear those wigs. But up until this conversation i had honestly never thought about it in depth, maybe it is a hangover from an earlier time when the mocking of certain races was acceptable in clown shows. I read a little bit about the subject last night.

After seeing 1000's of clowns in my life on tv etc wearing those wigs perhaps many of us subconsciously connect someone with big hair to looking a bit silly because of most clowns appearance. I accept i may be guilty of this myself.

So i think it's safe to say this was just a bit of a misunderstanding on both our parts, and maybe a little ignorance on mine.

Fellaini isn't useless. He's got his uses. He's a big chap, he's pretty physical, he's hardworking and he's not that horrible with his feet. If a team plays him as no 10 then he can be quite a nuisance mostly because of his size + because most top defences aren't equipped with players to counter him. The typical 6.3ft tall top quality defenders are a rarity these days. 

The problem with Fellaini is that he can only be effective if a team plays in a certain way. Unfortunately for him and us no big club can play that game anymore. If he played deep he loses most of his effectiveness (the guy is hardworking but he lacks the passing ability to be a playmaker, the mobility to be a Gattuso type of player or the positioning to be a Carrick type of player). In few words he is the less adaptable version of Andy Carroll.

3966~~~
Wow. Busby is turning in his grave.

3967~~~
Of course they can. If you want to find discrimination where there isn't one, you should look closely to your post here.

3969~~~
Well, it's hard to not notice him on the field to be honest.

3970~~~
Will he start for Belgium?

I actually think he'll be first choice sub in our midfield. Can't see Mourinho getting rid of someone as big and strong as him.

3971~~~
In before caf starts shitting on him.

3972~~~
Doing well.

Coincidentally, Belgium look pretty poor generally.

3973~~~
He nutmegged someone early on - must be a career highlight for him - but has been pretty shite since.

3974~~~
Looks pretty good in the 10 position.

3975~~~
Having a good game. Shown some good touches and has got stuck in, as usual. Loved when he took De Rossi out. Still haven't forgot about what he said about us.

3976~~~
Awful player. He & his Afro are a lighting rod for negativity.

3977~~~
The one thing I did not want him to do was to elbow Darmian. Guess what?

He did! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3978~~~
He's no 10 that's for sure. That said, he's definitely certainly good a being disruptive and his distribution isn't completely wank either.

3979~~~

3980~~~
The blonde oaf is nearly as shit as our fellaini

3981~~~
Comfortably Belgiums best player,  though that's not saying much.

3982~~~
Decent perofrmance, but not really someone you want to see week in week out in our team. 

I am pretty sure we could sell him for a good price.

3983~~~
I struggle to see what managers see in him. Such a pointless and bland player.

3984~~~
I don't even understand the "Belgium's best player" comments, he's a nothing player and should have cost them 2-0 in the first half when he was outjumped by a midget.

Their manager deserves sacking for playing him ahead of a an actual footballler like Dembele.

3985~~~
The thing is, he wasn't regular Fellaini bad tonight but when he starts, it is nothing more than a reactive approach to the game. The whole team is forced to play in a certain way when he takes certain positions on the pitch. Hazard, KdB could have started at #10 to greater effect. Dembele, a superior player could have brought more to the game. Fellaini just unbalances any team, even if he manages not to have a bad game.

3986~~~
It's utterly bizarre isn't it? He's basically Peter Crouch playing in midfield. He doesn't pass through the lines, can't play diagonals, can't play a final pass or dictate a game. He gets praised for winning headers.

He was nowhere near Belgium's best player. Hazard & De Bruyne were both better.

3987~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3988~~~
Fellaini at 10. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3989~~~
He was one of Belgium's better players, as for United he's a number 10 that has been played out of position ever since he was signed.  It just makes David Moyes buying him and playing him as a midfielder seem an even more bizarre decision.

3990~~~
Did you watch him play at Everton?

3991~~~
He was Belgium's best player tonight.

3992~~~
I really hope we sell him. He's had 3 seasons now and just has to go at this stage.

3993~~~
Still not good enough. Neither were the rest of that Belgian team by the way.

3994~~~
Courtous was Belgium's best player by a mile

3995~~~
Do you think that they will be interested in buying him back at the same fee they sold him up?

3996~~~
My point was that he's an effective no.10 as evidenced at Everton.

3997~~~
not sure why you think I'd think that

3998~~~
He had a good game, awful game in general though. Most of the Belgians were off for some reason.

3999~~~
Ahh, the Fellaini hate is back.

4000~~~
In the way Everton played under Moyes, sure. Not sure many here would like to see us play that way, or that Belgium couldn't do better either.

4001~~~
Can't stand the negativity. He's our player and he loves United.

He was instrumental in our FA Cup glory and yet barely gets any praise of it. If it wasn't for his goals against West Ham and Everton, we wouldn't have even got to the final. I'd argue if he played in that West Ham game at Upton Park, we would have got Top 4.

He always gives it 100%. Which is more than you can say for the majority of our "fan favourites"... Some people on here just want an entire Starting 11 every week of small weak players like Herrera and Januzaj. Absolutely no balance whatsoever. You have to change your team and tactics to counter the opposition. Fellaini is useful in the big games cause he offers strength and presence. 

If you knew anything about football, you would see why every manager seems to favour him. Doesn't matter if it's Moyes or Van Gaal or Mourinho. He'll be one of the first names on the sheet.

4002~~~
Such a pointless "footballer".

I always automatically want our players ' international teams do well if the player is playing, even our ex players, but I just don't feel anything like that when he / Belgium are playing.

4003~~~
Im asking you if its the case

4004~~~
same old same old

4005~~~
There's some serious pro Fellaini bias in here. Lets see what the Italians think about him

Best player my .....

4006~~~
The pointless footballer was one of the main reasons why we won the FA Cup. The Caf won't notice it though cos most of them are too busy wanking over Herrera who has been hugely ineffectual this season.

4007~~~
FA cup, serious matter

Who were the finalists? Ah yes...Crystal Palace. What a team.

4008~~~
Next time when they ask us who we want to play we'll ask for Barcelona.

4009~~~
They prefer competing in the CL I am afraid. The FA cup is becoming a cup for those whose got little chance of winning anything else. Arsenal, us, Wigan. Also the finals are usually thrilling...Man United vs Palace, Wigan vs Manchester City, Arsenal vs Aston Villa or Hull, Manchester City vs Stoke....wow.

4010~~~
Yeah, there are no matches like Madrid vs Bate or Barcelona vs Krasnodar in the CL either. Next time Fellaini decides who he plays in the quarter/semis/final we should expect him to pick somebody more challenging.

4011~~~
I've yet to see Bate and Krasnodar in the CL final

And he did have a more challenging game yesterday. Unfortunately he ended up running like a dog behind a ball as the Italian midfielders schooled him again and again. Size seems always to lose against brains

4012~~~
Wasn't Herrera's effort that won us the game against Everton? Etc Good things can be said for anyone. Point is Fellaini is a focal point in our team and now we are a midtable team.

4013~~~
Yeah right, that is a good comparison to Fellaini who scored against in the QF replay, SF and had a good performance in the finals.

4014~~~
He isn't a focal point of our team, at no point was he.

But since CL is so glorious then such shit teams should even be there, amrite? If you want some minnows in the finals then BVB (compared to the Bayerns, Barcelonas et al. before you try to jump the gun), Monaco, Porto would be your best shots.

He's had challenging games against City, Chelsea, Tottenham, this year or last year and didn't fail to deliver either. The whole Belgian team was schooled yesterday, trying to single him out while he was one of their better performers yesterday is as silly as it gets but what's new.

Oh, and just to make it clear since it looks you missed the point, you get to play what's in front of you.

4015~~~
Don't bother mate, just remember this quote whenever he replies

"Don't argue with idiots. They'll drag you down to their level then beat you with experience"

4016~~~
Yeah, blame Fellaini for his team making poor decisions throughout the game. 

When you're writing every other post in a thread you should recognise that you probably hold a little bit of bias. 

Fellaini was one of our best players over the past 18 months and when others played like League 1 players whilst being adored by the fans, he was being booed and still stepped up. 

Your UCL/FA Cup argument is dumb to say the least. We will leave it at that.

4017~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/74/blog/post/2890087/belgium-let-down-by-marouane-fellaini-vs-italy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/european-cham...elgium-let-down-by-marouane-fellaini-vs-italy</a>

4018~~~
He needs only couple of good games for us for people to say that we won those games just because of him. You would think we never won the game without him in our side. He scored fecking 3 goals all season despite even playing as a striker at times ffs. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Mamy still say we reached the top4 last season only because of him.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Have you even been in Herrera's thread this season? Majority are saying he's had really shit season including his biggest fans(you can include me too there), how can you even say something like that? 

I really hate this thread for things like this. Anytime he plays well his team has won the game because of him, maybe because you people think he is better than Messi?

4019~~~
I blame no-one really. The Belgian midfield is a physical midfield with little talent or technique. The manager has no option rather then to play that way. Its not as if Fellaini can play like Zidane can he? United on the other hand have a different scenario. We can actually afford bringing players in who actually know how to play football.

Regarding Fellaini All I am saying is that he's pretty a one dimensional player. He can only play no 10 and he's only effective in a game which is pretty direct and relying heavily on crosses. That game is pretty nullified if a team has tactical awareness and ability to pass the ball efficiently.

And yes we need a change in staff but especially in the system we play. That's why LVG was sacked and Mou was signed. Having said that, while some players will probably thrive under Mou I am not that sure if Fellaini can do that. As said before he's a pretty a one dimensional player which limits his game a lot

4020~~~
So you're comparing Monaco and Porto to Stoke and Palace? Seriously? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The CL is the pinnacle of football. The FA cup is a non cup ie a 4th priority behind the EPL title, top 4 qualification and the UEFA cup (whose winner gets a place in the CL) and ahead to the league cup and the charity shield. It had become the sort of club losers tend to aim to because there's nothing for them to win.

That's why the manager of the FA cup winner team ended up fired few days later.

4021~~~
The winner of the FA Cup gets into Europe too. So your problem is that we didn't face Arsenal in te FA cup? Palace beat Spurs and Watford (who beat Arsenal). We beat Everton (who beat Chelsea who had beaten city) and west ham (who beat Liverpool). Clearly it's not as easy as saying 'we beat only palace'.

4022~~~
Yeah the Europa league, ie the FA cup version of the CL - the chance of playing in the CL if you actually win it.

I have no problem with anything really. All I am saying is that the FA cup hasn't been a top priority for top clubs for a long long time. You only have to see the past few finals to acknowledge that.

Do you think that United wouldn't trade the FA Cup win to a top 4 place?

4023~~~
Won't he be entering the final year of his contract? Unless we plan to give him an extension, which would be Nani level ridiculousness, I don't see him being here next season.

4024~~~
The information should probably be posted here, United have the 7th tallest roster, it isn't a team of dwarf.

4025~~~
Most smaller teams prefer to qualify for Europe and play their best in the FA cup. Wigan were relegated the year they beat second in the league city in the cup final. Teams play much better in FA cups.

It's irrelevant what united fans would choose. Your earlier point was that FA cup final was not a big enough game because it's only crystal palace. Which obviously couldn't be more wrong. Teams play much better generally in the FA cup than they do in the league.

4026~~~
I always thought United to be among the top clubs.

My point is that the FA Cup had become  5th priority for clubs like ours behind the CL win, the EPL title, top 4 qualification and even winning the UEFA cup. A consolation prize when they can achieve anything else. Hence why lower tier clubs tend to find themselves in the finals. The top clubs doesn't really take it seriously.

4027~~~
That took me by surprise to be honest. I think things will improve further if Bailly takes Blind's spot in CB and Embolo is signed

4028~~~
So what? The point here isn't that FA Cup > CL. Your point earlier was that Fellaini playing well in the FA Cup is not good enough as we only faced crystal palace. Fellaini is hardly the reason for our poor season anyway so all what you say is highly irrelevant here . The point that was made was that Fellaini was instrumental in our FA Cup win. And clearly the smaller teams  punch above their weight against the big teams and Fellaini was integral to our win. Also consider our inability to win against teams like Norwich Sunderland and all (especially away from OT). To not give him the credit for that is just crazy. Had that been Carrick or Herrera who had that, lots here would show that as a reason for them to get ballon d'or.

No one is calling him the reincarnation of Xavi but he is clearly a talented player, more than some of the dross we have had starting for us in the past (like buttner and all). And it's not completely unlikely that he will be retained as well.

4029~~~
Are you talking about the quote about killing himself if he had joined United?

I think people misunderstand that one, i think he meant Roma started that season winning ten games in a row and were still unbeaten. So they were looking like having their best chance of winning the league in years. I think thats what he meant, he would have been upset if they had won the league the year he left.

4030~~~
I think this bolded text is a distortion. It would be truer to say he has to practically win games on his own for most people to say he had a good game.

4031~~~
I agree in that one match we would have got at least a draw with him in the side considering how we conceded the goals.

But conversely had he not played in any other league match where he was deployed in a midfield 2 where he was awful and we continually got overran we would have got better results in those matches and qualified for the CL maybe even before that West Ham game. 

So its swings and roundabouts.

4032~~~
I don't understand how anyone can be surprised by it, even our small players aren't that small at the exception of Mata, it's baffling when people justify Fellaini's presence against teams like West ham who are smaller than us. 
But on the topic of Fellaini, if Fellaini had the same dominance than Jan Koller I would gladly play to his strength but he doesn't, he is like Raul Garcia and no one want Raul Garcia.

4033~~~
The point is that we're overrating both Fellaini and the meaningless FA cup which no big team really takes seriously anymore unless they cant win anything else. For some strange reason it reminds me of our regular pre season game against Barcelona TBH. We usually do well against them and we have high hopes etc only for reality to kicks in when things got serious.

Pep's Barcelona, SAF's teams and even yesterday's Italy showed that you don't need neanderthals in central midfield to win games even against the most physical of sides. All you need is an effective system and talented players who do their share of workrate.

4034~~~
A player who plays as a midfielder for most of the games and many times as 10 and the team even changes the gameplan according to his traits (hoofing the ball etc) is a focal point of a team.

4035~~~
As said it did took me by surprise. I always felt that our team lack inches. 

I agree 100% with your Fellaini's comment

4036~~~
It really looks like the other way around here. If he has a few decent passes and doesn't elbow anyone, people will say he's been excellent.

Heck, some people, without a hint of sarcasm, say he's been one of our best players over the last 18 months!

4037~~~
I didn't compare anything I just mentioned that without Herrera maybe we wouldnt be in the final. The same stands for Fellaini. I just said its pointless to use 2-3 games or 2-3 highlights to shield a player that has turned us to a midtable club. If you want to compare let's talk about the Arsenal game where Fellaini didn't play or the Everton game early in the season. Or we can talk of how great Fellaini played against PSV (in the second game), or Liverpool in EL.

4038~~~
That's true too, but then he was never good enough to win games on his own anyway, but some people say he did that.

4039~~~
Was he important in our late season effort to get into CL and in our cup run? I think you'd have to say he was when you consider we never lost a game he played in since the 2-0 loss at Anfield (where he was our 3rd highest rated player on whoscored and where Carrick's blunder cost us the second goal).

4040~~~
I dont blame Fellaini for turning us to a midtable club. I blame the ones bringing him here as he was clearly unsuited for a top club

4041~~~
Yeah i have seen many say he was one of our best players last season, yet Rooney who probably had a better season overall is often rated one of our worst. It's weird

For a solid 2-3 months in central midfield Fellaini was Rooney before Xmas bad. From late March onwards when Van Gaal finally figured out he's not a central midfielder he was better . And fair play to him he was instrumental late in our cup run but for me overall he had a poor season.

4042~~~
I thought he was decent for Belgium. They were quite poor but IMO he was in their best two or three.

4043~~~
Majority said he had really shit season because he had poor season. But majority people wanted to see him in starting eleven every single game last season. Even in some of our muppet next season starting eleven Herrera is in the list.

4044~~~
That's because people believe he has the ability to do well for us. Many of us don't have the same opinion about Fellaini.

4045~~~
I guess the guy was right saying "too many people busy wanking on herrera" even though he put poor performance every games.

4046~~~
Except majority admitting he was shit last season? yeah, great argument.

4047~~~
Again, it's very simple:

People acknowledge Herrera was bad but they believe he can do much better.
People acknowledge Fellaini was bad and they believe he cannot do much better, this is the best we can hope for and it's not enough.

It's not complicated. You might disagree with their assessment of either player, of course.

4048~~~
You don't get it don't you? Even though the argument is so simple. He was right about people wanking on herrera.
Like i said before majority admitted he was shit which is true. But every week they were keep saying to play Herrera ahead of Fellaini even though in reality he played poor and Fellaini had a better games.

4049~~~
He's here now, we wont get a good fee for him so there's bugger all point selling him. Keep him as a bit part squad player, he's always fit at least, as long as he's not first choice.

4050~~~
People acknowledge Herrera was bad but they believe he can do much better every weeks and the result is he didn't. And it was on and on until end of season. 
People acknowledge Fellaini was bad and they believe he cannot do much better but in reality he had better games than Herrera and people still believed that Herrera could do better even after so many times of their theory and beliefs are proven to be wrong.

4051~~~
I'm so torn on Marouane. He's really not the kind of player I want to be part of the First XI going forward, but then again he's scored some important goals, and at some points last season he looked like the only player who gave a shit. It's just a lack of overall ability that lets him down.

If only he could absorb the skill and grace of a fellow big man like Zlatan, a la those aliens from the space jam movie. He'd be some player!

Alas, only in my dreams.

4052~~~
No, Fellaini was probably equally bad, maybe even worse. But then you lot pretend he is good at times even when he is our worst player on the pitch. He was also shite in front of goal. But anyway people think that we will be better playing the likes of Herrera instead of the likes of Fellaini who simply isn't type of player who should be playing for us nor move us forward. 

Fellaini won't probably play much under Mourinho, or at least he'll play lot less than Herrera, simply because playing Fellaini isn't the way forward for a team or even club like United, Mourinho knows that.  Many are laughing at us for having Fellaini, but not many think the same about Herrera, which kind of proves that it's not just "Herrera's fans" who don't like Fellaini.

4053~~~
I'd yet to see any opposing fan being bother by us having Herrera. Except that "provoked" Slippy-G stamp.

edit: Also, I predict Fellaini will actually get more game time than Herrera.

4054~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/14-06-201618-36-46bnjtq.jpg" src="http://abload.de/img/14-06-201618-36-46bnjtq.jpg"/> 
He makes a lot of positive contributions.

4055~~~
I can recall the good and decent games of Fellaini last season but I seriously can't think a single good or decent game from Herrera last season. If you think Herrera had a better season than Fellaini then I don't know what kind of games you watched or you just one of those people that the poster said 'wanking on Herrera' and those people who had no clue but laughing. It's fair enough if people said Fellaini is not United quality and have a poor season but I don't think the poster is wrong calling people are wanking on Herrera because the reality is true. Every single games Herrera played, he always had poor games and people are being stubborn and keep saying the same thing 'Herrera should start' 'Herrera should play' even though it has been proven until end of the season that the theory and beliefs are wrong.

4056~~~
Why isn't he playing today, I read here he was their best player in last game? Wilmots has an agenda against him too?

4057~~~
He is just, you know, a bit average. A sub you throw in in the last 20 minutes when you chase a goal and hope he scores somehow with his mob.

4058~~~
That's exactly how you would explain it. I mean how else would he be able to destroy a Man united side on the opening day of the season all alone?

4059~~~
Well if you play like Everton, but Belgium and United have different plans than just lumbing the ball every 2 mins all game to his mob and chest.

4060~~~
His whole supposed skillset is nullified by the fact he's so clumsy. He should boss games with his size and aggression but he's so sloppy and constantly leads with his elbows and has such exaggerated movements that every other challenge he makes is a stupid foul. I'm sick to death of watching it.

4061~~~
He does.

4062~~~
He really doesn't. I'd be interested to hear your definition of "bossing" a game.

4063~~~
Very rarely. The majority of time he either slows up our play or gives away a needless foul conceding possession and momentum.

4064~~~
You didn't mention anything about him being average in our current setup. You said he was average. Also, if you think Everton were "lumbing" the ball forward while he played there you didn't follow Everton at all and are just repeating a myth many say on here.

4065~~~
When you say destroy are you referring to that time he beat Carrick to a header when he was playing at Centre back?

Very rarely.

4066~~~
Seriously? When played in the right position (to me as the most advanced in a three) he dominates, in my opinion. 

When a manager like Mourinho specifically goes out his way to try and mark Fellaini out the game. That's something Sir Alex did with Pirlo, Ozil, etc.

4067~~~
if fellaini starts for your team, it means you are shite. Simple.

4068~~~
White text??...please??

The tallest guy on the pitch who is constantly running into the box and a target for long balls would be man marked whatever level you play at, whether that's Jose Mourinho or Uncle Jim, the manager of the local under 8s. It's basic logic. It says nothing about Fellaini's 'talent'.

4069~~~
Pretty much that. He is most of the time uselesss, his few goals dont change it. He had 3 seasons here and is still average
Stop nitpicking around, of course i meant for top level football. He would be useless in every setup that isnt based on long ball football and him playing at the 10. He always dominated because of his chest and mob, not because of the abilities that matter in every top clubs setup. Plus he is clumsy as it gets and an elbow waiting to happen. He will be basically our Mikel to tighten things up in midfield or someone we throw at some point and hope for the best.

4070~~~
This is what I always say. Would he start for Bayern/Barca/Madrid? if the answer is no then why is he starting for us. We want to go back to being at the level of those other 3 teams.

4071~~~
Yup, not in slightest bit surprised Belgium look a miles better and more fluid team today.

4072~~~
Fellaini was one of our better midfielders this season. Unfortunately no one likes him or has ever liked him so he ends up taking a lot of shite on here while a lot of the other players get of easily or (And this is positively hilarious) their form is blamed on Fellaini. Needs to leave though as he's not good but hope he does well wherever he plays.

4073~~~
Fixed Akash.

It's amazing that you're against Zlatan when we were playing such a limited midfielder for the sole reason that he added fight, height and a target when needed.

4074~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Aside from that being completely bollocks you seemed to have missed the point quite spectacularly.

4075~~~
Yep that much more accurately describes Fellaini for us last year.

4076~~~
I think the contrast in quality of the opposition side plays a bigger factor.

4077~~~
Nope, I really don't think I have.  Who doesn't get shit on here?  "Weak overrated Herrera", "old man Carrick", "too slow fat Schweinsteiger", "waste of money sideways Morgan" "sell him to China Rooney"..

Who gets off "easily"?

4078~~~
Said it time after time again. He's a lightning rod for negativity yet you had people thinking he was anywhere near their best player against Italy. 

Needs to be binned by Jose.

4079~~~
It has nothing to do with his talent and everything with the way LVG set up the team. With him as a focal point of the attack, United were completely one-dimensional, and the fact that he was chosen by Mourinho has everything to do with the fact that he is a weak link in this scheme and very little with the fact that he is as influential individually as Pirlo/Ozil. And the fact that Zouma completely nullified him also doesn't do Fellaini any favors.

4080~~~
Ireland are not push overs and neither are they slouches.

4081~~~
You gotta be kidding me. Any criticism of the other midfielders is almost always tempered with how they have been vangled. Not to mention the amount of shit Fellaini got for being the reason some of those midfielders are shit. According to some he was the reason we were playing shit football.

I mean I do agree he's a bit shit and should be sold but if you think Fellaini is being treated just like any other player then you're batshit blind. There were people quite literally questioning whether he was championship standard. The mind boggles.

4082~~~
Everton had 11 players out there, you know. 

And just how long will that game be brought up as a testament to Fellaini's incredible quality? Because Morten Gamst Pedersen once scored a fecking hat-trick against United but nobody seemed keen on bringing him here.

4083~~~
Whaaaat?  Sorry Akash but you don't half make sweeping statements and once again, that is complete nonsense.

4084~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4085~~~
Think your logic regarding Mourinho is a bit off. Man marking a player doesn't necessarily mean he bosses the game. It could just mean that the opposition game plan is very dependent on him, or that he's a threat very easily nullified by man marking. For example, Scholes regularly bossed games without anyone man marking him as they probably knew he'd be too difficult to man mark and/or the rest of the team would find a way around it. Neither was true in Fellaini's case.

4086~~~
It's almost a widely held belief round here that Bastian, Morgan and Herrera have been vangled. You don't even need to look too hard to find such posts. I'd have a look if I were you.

4087~~~
They should have. That's how we beat Milan. Just ask Pirlo.

4088~~~
Right. So why do you think the likes of Modric, Iniesta etc. aren't always man marked either? After all, if it worked on Pirlo....

4089~~~
Any thread involving them will have most posters claiming 'I am sure he will thrive under a proper manager'

4090~~~
Ferguson once played Phil Neville on the right wing against Sunderland, when asked after the match why he did this. He said Michael Gray was their biggest attacking threat on the left, so he nullified it and we won 5-0. 

Fellaini can be dangerous no doubt, at that time United were beating the press by humping it up to Fellaini. So by putting Zouma onto Fellaini he effectively cut off our out ball when under pressure. But Fellaini bossing games not for me.

4091~~~
You need players like Park! Only him can run that much in a game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4092~~~
This didn't happen at all. We played arguably our most attractive football in the last 2 years during those games.

4093~~~
So in that run of games De Gea or the defenders never hit it long to Fellaini when we were being pressed? Be serious mate please.

I never said we didn't play good football in those games, i said when under pressure we were playing it long at times to Fellaini as an out ball. That is a fact re-watch those games.

4094~~~
I'm not saying they are, but they're not Italy, and not a side managed by Conte.

4095~~~
They would have of course but nothing like the way you mention it when you say 'humping it up to fellaini'. We had triangles all over the pitch with Blind Young and Fellaini on the left side and mata Herrera and Valencia on the right.

There would definitely have been kicks to him from Goalkicks and stuff but nothing like the way you mention as our main tactic. Fellaini was also making contributions with passing. His goal vs Spurs was from a throughball from Carrick, he made the pass to Herrera which led to mata s first goal vs Liverpool and all for instance. We never played it upto him as a habit.

4096~~~
We'd been hitting it long all season under pressure, the reason why it looked better with Fellaini in the team was because we were actually getting something out of it rather than staying under pressure.

4097~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-defends-marouane-fellaini-8214531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-defends-marouane-fellaini-8214531</a>

A bit unexpected defender appears.

4098~~~
I liked him at Everton too

4099~~~
He's not entirely wrong. Fellaini certainly gets a certain degree of extra criticism. That was especially the case in the Moyes season where a lot of other players totally failed to perform, as did the manager, yet the new guy we brought in became a bit of a scapegoat.

That doesn't change how limited he ultimately is at this level though. You can criticise Fellaini without being unfair and defend Fellaini without overrating him. We just struggle to find the right balance between the two sometimes.

4100~~~
Keane likes him because at the least Fellani has guts and doesn't hide on the pitch. Unlike some other signings we have made.

4101~~~
There are countless examples of his strolling around the pitch while the game had gone forward. Never understand this supposed "great attitude" of his

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXWKCPeM3lg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Here, for example, he is just a spectator with a great view. When the ball is further than 2 meters from him he just shuts off

4102~~~
So Belgium finally spark into life and surprise surprise no fellani in the team.

How much longer has this guy got left on his contract?

4103~~~
Me too.

4104~~~
Hitting it long or humping it whats the difference? It's just another way of describing a long high pass up the pitch.

I specifically said we were hitting it long to Fellaini to bypass the opposition's press. I made no mention of our style of play over all, nor did i imply it was our main tactic. If you got that from my post then you have misinterpreted it mate.

I don't disagree with that at all mate. During that period of games it was very effective. Which is why Mourinho as explained in my earlier post was looking to stop that out ball for us.

4105~~~
That isn't what I mean by hiding on the pitch. It more refer to when things are going bad, or even well, some players do not show for the ball of shirk or going in for challenges against tough players. Fellani doesn't do that. That is a terrible lapse in awareness and application in the clip that you posted rather than him hiding.

4106~~~
Keane likes him because Fellaini is a bit dirty haha, but seriously mostly he's backing him because he's a contrarian who likes to go against popular opinion. The Nani red card being a classic example.

Still love Roy though.

4107~~~
Pretty sure SAF manmarked him in his last season too, with Jones playing at CM.

4108~~~

4109~~~
Yes, because he caused us a lot of damage in the previous fixture.

4110~~~
You'll have to ask the managers. Not necessarily man marking, but if, as a team, you press high up, it gives these midfielders very little space to operate in. If not, like you said, they'll dominate.

4111~~~
Everyone else gives a well thought out reply, then theres you.

4112~~~
All he does is shitposting in this thread so what's new.

4113~~~
Ah right, that's slightly different. You're right, as a team they're stupid if they don't do that, especially when a team depends on that one key player. Man marking like we did to Pirlo is slightly different though. It only really works with certain players in certain teams.

4114~~~
I am referring to the 90 other minutes in the game and what the experts have been saying.

4115~~~
Except Everton did not play long ball football and Fellaini dominated teams over there. 

I mean if people think Fellaini is not good enough for Manchester United, fair enough but stop discrediting him as some sort of relegation team player. Just proves your lack of knowledge on him.

4116~~~
Probably because they did thrive under proper managers.

Rooney, Carrick & Schweinsteiger have won the Champions League and many domestic league titles while being key players. Mata was key in a CL & EL winning side. Herrera helped Bilbao to their first EL final in 35 years (I'm not clear on how pivotal he was in that). Schneiderlin is the one who arguably didn't play at a level much higher than Fellaini, but got hyped more in that 14/15 season under Koeman than Fellaini did while under Moyes.

I'm not saying they will "thrive under a new manager", but just explaining that they're proven at a higher level, hence people are more likely to blame other factors for underperformance.

4117~~~
He played very well that night no doubt and was hard to handle, but saying he destroyed us single handedly is overstating it a bit mate. The game finished 1-0.

It was was a pretty even game in terms of possession and chances. They took one of theirs from a corner fair play to them. But it should be noted we were playing a makeshift back four with Valencia and Carrick filling in. He did more damage to us in the 4-4 game than in that 1-0.

4118~~~
Thing with Fellaini in the United team (especially as part of a two man midfield) is that he can look decent whilst everybody else looks crap (and its because the game is going towards his style of play). 
Whereas when he doesnt play, im sure United had a better record without him (and at times played better football without him).

I think the only time ive seen him used well and play well was when we went to that 433 and used him further up front. He also scored against Spurs and City in that run.

4119~~~
If only you had a well thought out post.

I mean, honestly, the same as Fergie did with the likes of Pirlo, Ozil and mr "etc". It's pretty much as funny as it gets.

4120~~~
Am I wrong then? Didn't Sir Alex and Mourinho specifically put in players to man mark Fellaini?

4121~~~
And what was the point you were trying to make ?

4122~~~
Well, you said, "<i>I mean, honestly, the same as Fergie did with the likes of Pirlo, Ozil and mr "etc". It's pretty much as funny as it gets</i>".

So I'm asking you if what Sir Alex did with Pirlo and Ozil is different to what he did with Fellaini, in terms of making sure he had someone to man mark them?

4123~~~
Again with this yeah he had a great game but.... they did this and they did that. I honestly don't understand this recurring theme on this forum. If someone has had a good game then you just admit that they had a good game and I know you did that but then you went on discrediting his achievement. 

Destroying single handedly may be exaggeration (even though I heard one of the pundits say it once), but he dominated the game and won it for Everton. That's good enough by its own. To come to the bigger picture: Fellaini is capable of having games like that and one his day he can be almost unstoppable.

Now like I said before, if anyone thinks he isn't suited for Manchester United and we need a different kind of player or that he's not good enough to start for aspiring European champion then fair enough. Even though I don't agree with that a hundred percent, I can understand it. But when people just discredit all of his performances and say he's a useless lump only good when long ball tactics are applied, their opinions can't be taken seriously.

4124~~~
Glad to see to the security at the Euros doing their job for once.

4125~~~
So you can't explain what point you were actually trying to make, well that's a good start right there for you. From the outside it looked like you were trying to make a very cheap point about Fellainis quality, Fergie had him man marked and he used to do that with the likes of Pirlo, so that's how highly Fergie rated him, same same and all that.

Fergie had Pirlo tracked by Park because Pirlo was the one pulling all the strings, cut off Pirlo successfully and severely limit Milans passing. Seeking to limit the way the opposition normally plays, it's normal and everyone does it. It's not something Fergie did with a few select players, or Mourinho. City, Tottenham and Liverpool allowed Fellaini to roam between midfield and attack where he was a constant passing option for us. It showed us just how difficult it is to play against Fellaini if he's given time and space. As a result, he was pretty much constantly allowed to bring the ball down in dangerous areas. Just like he did against us in his holy grail of matches, which is constantly fapped about by some in here, where we had Michael Carrick as a cb and a central midfield consisting of Scholes, Nani, Cleverley and Kagawa. It's true that Fergie had Jones follow him to limit Evertons ability to use him, it's natural, it's also true that Jones went off after half time and we spent the remaining match with Giggs, Cleverley and Carrick in midfield, and we still dominated with ease. While the matches against City, Tottenham and Liverpool showed how effective he can be given time, the match against Chelsea showed just how far below he is the required level. Mourinho did two things with ease, he limited our ability to play out of defence and he stuck zouma on Fellaini to prevent us from using Fellaini as a passing option to relieve pressure. As a result we were toothless. 

After 3 seasons, that run of matches is still the best Fellaini has ever done for us, which says it all.. If Mourinho can get that out of Fellaini on a consistent basis, superb. Overall he has performed worse than Anderson, and he was ridiculed

4126~~~
It's not a discredit of a performance to say he's a useless lump only good when long ball tactics are applied, that's just the truth. He could still have an excellent performance, but that's still the truth. Andy Carroll is a turd of a player, but that hattrick against Arsenal was an excellent performance.

See, it's not difficult.

4127~~~
Well I think he's a useless lump, only good for helping out defence on set pieces and maybe lobbing hopeful balls into the opposition box. Between boxes he's just making the numbers up. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4128~~~
I am not trying to discredit his performance at all mate. Only providing context, i have said in many posts on here in the right set-up he can be a nightmare to handle almost unplayable at times. In that game he didn't destroy us though in my opinion, he had a great game and got his side the win by taking advantage of the fact we were playing two midfielders in a patched up defence. He beat Carrick to a header for the winning goal did he not.

I also said i thought he did more damage against us in the 4-4 when he had a full defence out and were in really good form. I thought he was brilliant that day i'f im honest. So it's not as if i am unwilling to give the guy credit.

4129~~~
So you do know what point I'm trying to make?

Would have been so much better to get a response like first time instead of the silliness. Nevermind.

I want to make it clear that I'm not comparing Fellaini with Pirlo, Ozil, etc. However, what I will say, is that although the Fellaini has a completely different skillset to the players I mentioned, he is still very dangerous, in my opinion, if played correctly. So much so that Sir Alex had to specifically get someone to man mark him.

4130~~~
Except when he played for a team that never used long ball tactics. It seems very difficult for you.

4131~~~
The only thing that's been consistently very dangerous with Fellaini since he joined us, is his tendency to use his elbows. Apart from that, over the 3 seasons span he's been here, he has overall been a massive disappointment apart from a small run of matches (i suppose he was man marked in all the other matches....) He isn't mobile enough, his technique isn't good enough and his passing isn't good enough. You're too caught up in him being man marked, as if it's the official stamp of approval from Fergie and Mourinho. He was at Everton between 08-13, not once did we make even an half arsed attempt at signing him. Man marking him was an effective way at preventing the opposition from playing their football, we easily limited Everton by doing it and Chelsea easily limited us by doing it.

Then again, people have funny opinions when it comes to Fellaini, it took quite a lot of people in here a good season to understand that he's not a defensive midfielder, even though the fecker thinks so himself (<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>)

4132~~~
Certainly not Everton.

4133~~~
Not sure what you mean. Everton were not a hoof ball team. Fellaini succeeded there. Yet... you still believe he only succeeds in hoofball tactics.

4134~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Everton were fecking dire, they loved playing the ball directly up to Fellaini so he could either head it onwards or chest it down, that was his biggest strength at Everton.

4135~~~
I'm not too caught up in anything. You asked me to make my point and I did.

4136~~~
They really weren't. In his final season there they played some really good football and so did he. I can only assume you didn't watch them very much beyond our games against them.

4137~~~
Football under Moyes was dire.

4138~~~
He was better with his head.

4139~~~
They played probably their best football under Moyes in his final season there that is true. It was not bad football at all, as you say really good at times in fact. Decent football was the exception though and not the norm they played some turgid stuff over the course of his 12 years there, more bad than good.

They were never exclusively a long ball side under Moyes so it would be harsh to brand them long ball merchants, but it was a regularly used tactic when Fellaini was playing further up the pitch it has to be said. As it has been at United also since Fellaini signed to be fair, if you are going to play him you might as well play to his strengths i suppose.

4140~~~
It's just so freaking obvious you didn't watch any of Everton's games.

4141~~~
Honestly can't understand why this guy gets so much stick. He's scored a lot of important goals for us and generally always gives it 100% when he's on the pitch. He's been a better signing than Herrera, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and some of the other "darlings" who've done nothing in the team.

Answer me this... would we have won the FA Cup without Fellaini? No.

Every time I see him on the team sheet, I know we're gonna be solid in the midfield. Some fans on here would have Blind, Carrick and Herrera in midfield if they had their way. Theres a reason every manager favors him. And I don't think Jose will be any different.

4142~~~
<a class="username" data-user="87357, @BigDunc9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87357/">@BigDunc9</a> <a class="username" data-user="48226, @SilentWitness" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48226/">@SilentWitness</a> Can we get a proper opinion from a couple of Everton supporters on this matter please? I thought they were pretty good to watch with Pienaar and Mirallas being very direct wide players playing in the lanes. Osman also had an excellent season from memory.

4143~~~
If it's about Fellainis last season it was a mix between direct football to Fellaini so he could get involved out wide or in the middle and also nice wing play between the Pienaar/Baines combo and Coleman/Mirallas. We weren't dire by any means though, played lovely football at times. Probably Moyes' best season in terms of playing nice-ish football.

4144~~~
Thanks. Myth well and truly busted.

4145~~~
To be fair SilentWitness and yourself are only referring to Fellaini's last season at Everton. SilentWitness confirmed even in that season they liked to play direct to Fellaini quite a lot. In seasons before that one with Fellaini involved they played some lets just say not so easy on the eye football.

So what myth exactly has been busted?

4146~~~
I think <a class="username" data-user="48226, @SilentWitness" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48226/">@SilentWitness</a> can back me up and confirm that Fellaini also had some really good spells in the deeper position partnered with Gibson. I suppose Everton not playing on the front foot that much under Moyes suited him though.

4147~~~
No doubt mate, i can remember him having some cracking games further back for you lot. I remember he had a few really good games vs City in particular. As you say though Everton being much more compact suited him playing in there.

For the majority of his time at United he's only really played well further forward in a freer role in my opinion. Last season in particular when Van Gaal continually played him deeper in a midfield two he was dire. He only started having a positive influence again when moved further forward towards the end of the season.

4148~~~
I'm really interested to see what Jose thinks of Fellaini, I hope he has a future here. Very athletically gifted player whose technique really isn't as bad as some like to make out.

4149~~~
Myth well and truly busted because an Everton supporter reckons that it was a mix between hoofing it up to Fellaini and "nice wing play" and that Everton according to him played lovely football at times.

Yes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's well and truly a busted myth.

Look at the performance he's still hailed for against us when we had Scholes Cleverley in central midfield, with Carrick as a defender against Fellaini, how did Everton use Fellaini..

More often than not Everton were dire, it was also mentioned when we hired Moyes (but the hope was Moyes would get more out of better quality players at United compared to what he had available at Everton).

4150~~~
What do you mean by very athletically gifted ?

4151~~~
You need to read that as "great at elbowing opponents in the face".

4152~~~
I am certain his point is that two of the world's best managers felt he was such a threat he had to man marked.

4153~~~
Mourinho once used Huth as a striker.

Fergie signed Bebe and Manucho

Shit happens.

4154~~~
I really don't understand why some people have to convince themselves that there's a brilliant player somewhere in Fellaini that's being misused. He's absolutely dire in central midfield, I've seen every game he's played there for us and he cannot do the basic things required of a midfielder: passing, positioning, temperament etc. He's a good battering ram though, if you're not set up to deal with him he'll take you apart.

4155~~~
I think he's best used in midfield to break up opponents' play and start counters. The worst way to use him is as a target man. The opposition usually surround him in that case and we become far too predictable. When he breaks up play and plays simple pass and move while getting forward we have done well.

4156~~~
Lot's of midfielders do that better than him.

4157~~~
Indeed it is, you have no credibility in here anymore.

4158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nice imagination and all..

If Fellaini doesn't turn out to be mint under Mourinho as the manager, Fellaini will end up as the worst big money signing in the history of the club..That's quite the achievement right there. Probably Fellaini's biggest achievement.

4159~~~
Worst big money signing in United's history? He's not even the worst big money signing in the last 3 years.

It's amazing you aren't thread banned given the amount of garbage you spew in this thread.

4160~~~
I disagree.

It's fine that you disagree as well, but it's not russia is it ?

4161~~~
Fellaini has proven to be an important player at times since he has joined, important insofar as he has performed okay, and sometimes well (sometimes among our best performers) in a poorly performing team. I am far from his biggest supporter and I think he should be sold as he doesn't fit into my view of what we need but I certainly don't disregard what he has done in his time here. I never expected much from him as I didn't particularly like him when we signed him but he isn't the worst big money signing in the history of the club. He has just been underwhelming.

4162~~~
Worst big money signing? What has Herrera and Schneiderlin done more than him that warrants them for deserving their fee of £28m and £24m respectively?

That's not even mentioning veron, di Maria Anderson and all

4163~~~
Why do people always use the same players to justify Fellaini. He is easily worse than any of the players you have mentioned. 

He has many years of experience as a PL player. He was brought in by his favorite manager,  favoured by Moyes and LvG. Adapting and consistency should not be as problematic for him as the others,  yet in the 3 years here people are still pointing out to a couple of games to justify him. Prices aside,  he is just not cut out for the top level of football for any team neither has he improved dramatically in ability for the last decade imo. 

Herrera and Schneiderlin have not been great but it obvious that they have been underused and mismanaged in there short time here. There is no denying their ability or there potential to get better either.

Di Maria did not want to be here yet for half of the season he put some fantastic performances that kept him high in the assists charts till the of the season. It arguable that he was severly mismanaged by LvG in the short time here. 

Using Anderson is just laughable imo. Are you comparing Fellaini to a player that came into the PL as a teenager,  was part of a successful era?  At least Anderson gave us a solid 2 seasons as a young player,  more games than Fellaini will ever manage in his entire United career.

4164~~~
Because they are all midfielders who play for Manchester United and are competing with each other? Shocking I know. And no, he's not easily worse. He's also had a better season than both and has done more for United than either of them.

4165~~~
Not true at all. Having talent is useless if that's not used to be effective. Schneiderlin I can agree he has been slightly mismanaged but Herrera to say he was mismanaged is a bit much. I mean he almost always played in midfield and yet he was underwhelming. Overall he has about 2 or 3 goals more than Fellaini and defensively he is also just as much a liability as Fellaini was as he gave cheap freekicks in dangerous positions quite frequently. This has got nothing to do with management but his ability. Being 'easily worse than any of them' is a gross exaggeration. It's quite close and considering they cost almost the same amount, they both would have similar tags

4166~~~
A proven premiership player for close to £30mill and he's been an important player "at times".

Overall, he's done feck all to be fair. It's shocking that a proven premiership player for almost £30mill fails to consistently play well. 

Not really all that impressive.

4167~~~
Does that equate him as being the worst big money signing in the clubs history though?

4168~~~
It should've said "one of"

4169~~~
What a dumb yellow for the Hungary game. Does he ever use his brain?

4170~~~
I for one am shock as to how much better Belgium look, play and counter attack without him in the side.

Weird. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4171~~~
It is a complete mystery indeed.

4172~~~
Want this guy gone ASAP.
Belgium is a perfect example of why people have been complaining.
He has a way of making everyone around him appear shite. When he's on the pitch, it forces the whole team to play in a way that is completely alien to them.

4173~~~
Now that you have said this. Watch us sell Mata and give Fellaini the #8 shirt!

4174~~~
Definitely. Especially when it isn't like that for us.

4175~~~
Stamping and elbowing everything that moves right now. Not only is he a prick, but he's an awful footballer too. Can't pass more than 5 yards, is slow and doesn't track runners. He's a joke.

4176~~~
Pretty awful so far, very clumsy

4177~~~
Kick him and his thug mentality out of the club.

4178~~~
Classic Fellaini that miss.

4179~~~
How did he miss that

4180~~~
Shocking signing.

4181~~~
Needs to be the first player Mourinho sells.

4182~~~
Almost as bad as Ronaldo

4183~~~
Useful because of his height. 

Now we got Ibra who has the height plus is 100 times the footballer Fellaini is. 

Need to get rid.

4184~~~
Bar that goal naingolan has been just as bad.

4185~~~
Well, he is adding innovation to his game.

Knee in the stomach or groin now as well as elbow in the face.

4186~~~
He is so predictable. If you play him for 90 minutes, you need to play hoofball and risk a red card. After a while, it gets found out. So you need to put him on and hope he causes havoc/scores a goal somehow, but also often misses good chances. I hope we sell him, but it wont happen

4187~~~
I hope England is watching and learning.....

4188~~~
Weird that trying to mount a comeback by subbing on Fellaini wasn't a good strategy. Who would've guessed.

4189~~~
I'll be disappointed if this clumsy oaf isn't sold.

4190~~~
What a cameo <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4191~~~
A truly bad football player. There's really nothing more to say tbh.

4192~~~
He is just not a good football player, you can like him all you want.

4193~~~
Just kills all momentum. Clumsy or dangerous fouls every 5 minutes. His passes are normally slow and straight at the receiving player causing attacks to lose pace. Can't believe he's a midfielder for man utd.

4194~~~
Thought he actually came on and made a difference. Was quite heavily involved unlike most of the rest of the Belgium team.

4195~~~
Righteo. He was terrible. Was booked and missed a sitter.

4196~~~
Slow start, and some silly fouls, but when Belgium started playing to his strengths, Wales couldn't handle him. As we know, he's always a threat in and around the box, whether it's in the air or on the ground. He seems to pick up good positions, and was unlucky not to score. Really should have scored actually, but wasn't to me.

4197~~~
fecking horrible player, clumsy in possession and was completely clueless defensively for Wales second.

4198~~~
For the right PL team he could be valuable, and with the money influx we see in the league I guess we can fleece someone like Sunderland for £15m for him.

4199~~~
Going against the grain here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
The very definition of confirmation bias, both sides of this thread (although I'm firmly on the "get rid" side)

4200~~~
And some want him to start for us? Sabotage fans!

4201~~~
I would love you to tell me where I'm wrong in my piece of text.

4202~~~
hope he gets sold.

4203~~~
Seeing him on the line at halftime, I knew Belgium is going to lose the game.

Sack the sucker right now.

4204~~~
Remember when Rio went months without conceding a foul? April one year to January the next, I think it was?

The only way Fellaini could go a month without conceding a foul is if he was in the middle of a six month injury layoff.

4205~~~
It's not the facts, it's their interpretation that's interesting. I think everyone would agree that he missed/had a great chance and was clumsy and dirty in his defensive game. But 95% posters agree that he was awful (and it's also a <i>confirmation bias </i>as we are influenced by our perception of the player - I would argue though that ours is closer to reality than yours, but it's a different point) and you make it sound like he was great but slightly unlucky

4206~~~
The game thread became unreadable after Fellaini came on. What the feck did a few years off the top do to some people?

4207~~~
After what is shaping up to be a brilliant transfer window it'll all be so disappointing at the end if fellaini stays 

Him and rojo need to feck off and I'll be happy as ever

4208~~~
I disagree, and this is what often happens on the forum. People misinterpret a lot of stuff.

There's no way I made Fellaini sound great. I gave an overview of what I saw.

Started slow
Silly fouls
Threat in the last 10 mins

Simple!

4209~~~
Should have scored and should also have tracked back for the Wales goal

4210~~~
Well, your overview was a little different when we consider how much time you spent talking about the negatives and the positives (unlike in the summary, where negatives obviously outweigh positives)

2 words about the slow start (literally "slow start")
4 words about his silly fouls (including "and" and "some", which is uncountable, but still usually meaning not a big amount, while Fellaini managed to make more fouls than any other player on the pitch in just 45 minutes)
and 59 words describing his threat in the last 10 minutes, including "good", "unlucky", "couldn't handle him" etc.

So you're objective and unbiased?

4211~~~
Again, this is where you're wrong. 

After the bit where I put 'Wales couldn't handle him', I spoke about Fellaini in general, using words like 'threat in and around the box', 'picks up good positions'. Am I wrong? Does he not provide a threat in the box? Both boxes, that is. 

I then summed it up by saying he was unlucky not to score. Then if you read after that, I put he should have scored.

Again, I don't see where I'm wrong.

4212~~~
Evidently we could handle him. Didn't score, didn't assist didn't prevent a goal.

4213~~~
He got onto the end of most crosses. Even Robby Savage said he was a threat. Could have easily picked up a goal and an assist. Didn't happen, but that doesn't mean you handled him.

4214~~~
Started fouling everything that moves when he came on and missed a great chance. Really summed him up.

4215~~~
He caused a lot of fouls slowed down belgium's play and should have been sent off.

Yes he's a threat around the box but he done more bad than good.

4216~~~
Unusual, but I do see your point and kinda agree with it.

4217~~~
You keep on describing as though he had an influential game and was unlucky not to lead Belgium to victory. This was hardly the case. The best thing he did was onto a handful of crosses and it still didn't lead to much.

4218~~~
Read my previous post. I said he was hard to handle in the last 10 mins. Ironically, those 10 mins he was pushed further up, where he was much more of a threat, in my opinion.

4219~~~
Wales really struggled to handle him for their second goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4220~~~
How the heck did we end up with him? Oh yea. THANKS A LOT DAVID. AMONG OTHER THINGS.

4221~~~
I like Fellaini but he's just not the kind of player I want the team I love to ever have to rely upon ever again.

Saying that he'll probably not leave this summer, so might as well get some use out of him when the time calls for it.

4222~~~
He seemed to be a threat not that he was really a threat. In one of your posts, you said the threats came when the Belgian team played to his strengths; lumping the ball to him. Is Fellaini worth it for the team to play for Fellaini? He is neither Messi nor Ronaldo so why would the team abandon what has served them thus far one player who isn't more than an average player but merely an option?

In their first game, Fellaini was terrible and with him in the side, the team resorted to lumping it to him rather than trying to be more creative and allowing for more individual brilliance to be exploited. Fellaini is a lazy option for managers and players alike. What did Fellaini do today that Dembele could not do? Apart from the 3/4 times when he got on the end of crosses, of which none was fruitful, he was no better than an average player. 

After the shambolic first game, Fellaini was dropped and guess what, Belgium were playing some proper and exciting football. Players were taking on players and their was an air of unpredictability about them rather looking for the easy way out in Fellaini. Belgium kept him out of the side and they got better. The best teams find many creative ways to break teams down rather than the prehistoric air to land missile strategy. 

It says a lot when Wilmots didn't start Fellaini despite losing Vermaelen, Vertonghen in the absence of Kompany to provide the so called needed height and physicality that Fellaini supposedly provides. Wilmots lost the game in one single act of cowardice: bringing on Fellaini.

4223~~~
I hope we keep him as a squad player.

We can't sell players just because their style of play isn't suiting some fans.

Fellaini brings height, physicality and fight. Yes, he do step over the line in terms of elbows/etc, but at least he let himself be known to the opposition.

4224~~~
We recently signed a guy who brings exactly those things with the added bonus of not playing like a clogged toilet.

4225~~~
His contribution is like Welbeck esque. You know he is clumsy and can't make most out of his chance, but you can't risk leave him alone to do his thing. Wales didn't contain him. He did mentally put Wales on the toes. However, with Fellaini's limited football abilities, from a potential threat to actual end product is still a lot of work. Fruit doesn't come off using him often enough. Frustrating dirty player to watch.

4226~~~
See i don't think he plays like a clogged toilet. He is a pain in the arse for defenders to deal with when played right.

Getting Zlatan does make Fellaini less important, but he could definitely still be useful next season.

4227~~~
I agree with this , I like Fellaini always have done.
Yes he has his faults, I see him playing his part next season.

4228~~~
Having read Jose's tactical blueprints years ago (Porto days) he usually goes for an imposing and confident defensive midfield. I don't think Fellaini fits the description but if he stays, my bets are on him playin as 6.

4229~~~
Here lies the problem. If we were a long ball team,  I doubt many will complain. If playing to a Fellaini strengths has been proven in the past but other clubs to generate success,  fewer would complain. If the top teams in the world to such tactics,  no complain. Should we play to the strengths of one average player or play to the strengths of the team? What percentage of our players are naturally inclined to play to Fellaini's strengths. 

The support for him is only because we have him not for the advantage of the team. I wonder how many would be interested in the next Fellaini. 

We claim that we are a big team but even the fans lack the dream of ambition to be a big team. Name one top team that will employ Fellaini and play to his strengths?

4230~~~
Forgetting his skill level, footballing level, what ever else, I just think the sneaky horrible way he plays and tries to hurt opponents is awful. I just can't begin to like him, never have really. humorous sometimes I suppose if he does it to another player you're not keen on but still cringeworthy.
The way he tackled bale last night and followed through trying to stamp with his second foot was disgusting. He could have had a yellow for the tackle and then an immediate red for the stamp in my opinion, lucky to only get a yellow.
Probably the only united player I've never warmed to and would be happy to see leave, and that's from day 1.

4231~~~

4233~~~
I will never ever get bored of watching that.

4234~~~
As i said i don't want him to start for us, but he could be a good squad player.

You don't have to constantly play long balls to Fellaini just because he is on the pitch, but he will always be a great target in the box. 

It was a mistake to buy him in the first place, but why not use him now that he is here?

4235~~~
Of course you don't have to but how often do teams resort to long balls as an easy escape route?  Pretty much most of the time. 

Why not use him while he is here?  Is the club here for him or him for the club?  I don't get this logic. It was clearly an error signing him in the first place but it is enough reason to keep him. We bought Bebe, why not keep him?  We hired Moyes and LvG but yeah let's keep them anyway.

4236~~~
Do i have to remind you that we played our best football under LvG with Fellaini in the team and that we didn't play long balls all the time. A good balance between long balls and a normal passing game can be achieved, even with Fellaini in the team.

Bebe was never as good as Fellaini. There is no reason to sell him unless someone bids a great fee. We need squad players, and Fellaini isn't one to create drama over sitting on the bench.

4237~~~
I try and be objective where Fellaini is concerned as I've never really been a fan of his style and I fully believe that to get the best out of him, you can only use him in a specific way - which effects the way which the team plays - long balls and direct. Strangely enough, our midfield options were so fire at the point we signed him, I was actually happy when Moyes did. But that's when I was under the impression Fellaini could do a job as a CM or even, DM.

The reason I want him sold though, is that IMO, he's not good enough to be a starter, and at best, he's a valuable plan B. But there are other implications of having him in the team though - £27m and possibly high wages - both could be recouped and it opens up a space in the squad to give minutes to some youth - Pereira/TFM etc.

We have enough senior midfielders in the team to provide the experience. I'm a massive Herrera/Mata fan as well, but I wouldn't mind of either of them/both are sold for the above reasons as well.

*obviously I'm not saying sell all 3. We need some decent depth, but you get what I'm saying, I hope.

4238~~~
Is it safe to say that you are referring to the "golden" 3 match run of 2 seasons ago? If it is then would you also use that as an argument for the other players like Herrera and Mata who were equally influential in that run. Did we not also have 3 shambolic performances right after that run,  with him in the side?  

What are really our best performances?  Is it because we beat some teams who we still beat the season after with less than impressive performances? 

I believe we have had better performances without Felliani near the pitch,  for a longer run of games. More recently,  Belgium got going the instant Fellaini was dropped and capitulated the moment he was reinstated. 

Players like Mata,  Rashford,  Lingard,  Herrera have been involved in more better performances were they have been equally influential and yet the sample size is still too small to make a proper judgement. 

Why would Fellaini even complain about on the bench when it is obvious that he is not good enough to be on the bench? Do you think Rojo would complain?  Or Anderson,  Bebe?  Is that what United have become?  Keeping a player in the team because he will not complain for been on the bench. We are talking about a PL player with almost a decade of PL experience. Players like Herrera should be looking up to Fellaini even. 

I'd rather have players that will want to fight for their place regardless of who is infront of them. I'd rather have a Pereira or TFM that have more to their game than just being more than option, young,  hungry and keeping the guys in front on their toes.

4239~~~
I mentioned that run of good football because you we're saying we only played long balls with Fellaini on the pitch, which we clearly didn't. 

Pereira and TFM can still be in the squad even with Fellaini staying. 

In the end it comes down to you not rating Fellaini, whereas i think he can contribute to our season. Maybe we should end it with that.

4240~~~
It was a 4 match period, 4 match period in the 3 seasons he's been at the club, a period where even Phil Jones played all those matches as well. Then Phil Jones went out injured, and we lost the following 3 matches against Chelsea, Everton and West Brom. Maybe Phil Jones was the key player...We played the long ball up to Fellaini plenty of times in that period.

4241~~~
It was most likely Carrick who also got injured that screwed it up, but that wasn't my point was it. We played long balls, but it was not the only thing we did. 

Plenty of top teams have used target men as an option in their team, it doesn't mean you have to do it constantly.

4242~~~
I have not said that we only play long balls when he's in the pitch. I said that managers and players use the Fellaini option as an easy way out rather than trying up their game or tempo. Either way,  we are more than likely to play more long balls with him on the pitch which is playing to his strengths and even then he is hardly effective contrary to popular belief. 

This is nothing to do with me not rating the player but stating the obvious. The Belgian campaign is clear for all to see, managed by a manager that favours Fellaini. Played good football on the floor without him and win. Panicked and brought him on in the second half against Wales and played long balls at will while Wales kept it on the ground and won. 

You have to ask yourself,  what percentage of football is played in the air?  10% max? How often does Fellaini dominate when the ball is in the air?  30% at most imo. So when the ball is not in the air,  what exactly is he doing that even a young Pereira cannot do if not better? 

I want United to get better and go back to the top. None of the clubs we aspire to be at the top footballing wise have this calibre of player. Not one resorts to the long ball tactics even when they are desperate. Even West Ham that have a way superior target man in Carroll play a lot of their game on the ground. Carroll is not interior when the ball is not in the air either. 

We can pretend that Fellaini is not a long ball player all we wants because it would look bad on us but it the only reason Moyes brought him in and wanted to bring Baines as well to complement him imo, to use him as a battering ram upfront. Even then,  it was an epic failure. If the manager that had nurtured him for almost a decade cannot remotely bring out any usefulness from Fellaini,  it tells the whole story. No top manager in football would look at him. How many players of that ilk have moved to the top clubs. Even the ones that are twice the player Fellaini is. 

So yeah, we can deceive ourselves and live in hope and sentiments,  thinking that Fellani is anything more than what we have seen while we get left behind.

4243~~~
So i don't want United to be back at the top, because i think Fellaini is a good player to have in our squad? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Moyes was too afraid to use Fellaini in his best position, which is behind the striker. He tried to use him as a box-to-box next to Carrick, a role which he clearly doesn't have the technical ability to do.

4244~~~
No, he can't be a #6. Too slow, gives too many fouls away. He will give goals away too if those fouls are just outside our box. No one needs a #6 who's good in the air. TFM will do a better, more mobile job.

4245~~~
So which is it?  The manager thinks his best position is high up the pitch but is afraid to use him (that made me chuckle) and when he is deployed there he has been largely crap BUT the players swears that he is a better DM but he hasn't got any ability to do jack? 

Is he sharing notes with Rooney?

4246~~~
I doubt anyone meant we did it 100% of the time, doesn't really change the fact that Fellainis greatest weaknesses show when the ball is played quickly along the ground, while his best strengths are shown when it's knocked up long to him. He was absolutely dire last night until he was moved up front to win a few headers

4247~~~
Some notable lightning quick 6's that played for Jose: Costinha, Motta, Cambiasso, Xabi Alonso, Makelele... But ye I agree TFM can become twice the player, as long as he has the proper mentality for the role.

4248~~~
Is Moptop officially redundant now we have Ibrahimovic (and possibly pogba)?

It's hard to deny in certain games Fellaini had his uses for set pieces and physicality. Ibra can give us that in both attack and defending set pieces as well as actually being able to play football.

4249~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

That would signal the end of dark times.

4250~~~
Jose wants specialists and Fella is one so i doubt he will be leaving. Nobody chests the ball better then him<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4251~~~
Haha, what position, though? 

If we play a 4231, then I can't see him staying.

4252~~~
number 10 obviously <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4253~~~
He's a specialist in being a big useless lump. Can't wait to see the back of him.

4254~~~
After Ibra signing I'm convinced that he will leave. I don't see any reason why we need to keep him when Ibra can offer what Fellaini offers. Height and winning header in set pieces. And also if the 4th player is really going to be centre mid then it's game over for Fellaini.

4255~~~
Agreed. But Fellani is also very useful in defending set pieces - I hope Jose addresses that area as well.

4256~~~
A 6ft4 backing a 6ft5 upfront would bring tears to Big Sam's eyes.

4257~~~
If we get all our targets, we won't need Fellaini to play "for set peices".

Zlatan - 6ft 5in
Bailly - 6ft 2in
Smalling - 6ft 4in
Pogba - 6ft 3in
Shaw - 6ft 1in
Schneiderlin 6ft 1in
Martial 6ft
Carrick 6ft 2in


Imposing team.

4258~~~
I can see Jose keeping him. He has composure, experience, works hard for the team and is very good in the air. He just needs to stop fouling people. He doesn't need to do that.

4259~~~
Been photographed smoking.

4260~~~
Is he still here?

4261~~~
He addressed it well I think so far. 
Carrick - 1 year extension 
Ibra - free 
Baily - £30m 

Not to mention Smalling and Shaw are tall enough as well.

4262~~~
The thing is we were useless at both defending and attacking set pieces whether he was in the team or not. I suspect having centrebacks at centreback might help with the defending as it means not having to disorganise the entire team at every set piece to account for one of them not being.

Our attacking set pieces might become a bit better when we stop pratting around trying to be clever with them despite having a team of idiots.

4263~~~
Yeah i agree that was obvious to almost everyone but Van Gaal.

4264~~~
It is frustrating how crap he is at scoring from headers.

4265~~~
Jose is not Big Sam

4266~~~
He and his elbows are a liability - Jose's seen the light with Rooney, he'll see the light with Fellaini too. In Jose we trust.

I never knew he had a twin brother. And he's called Mansour of all things. I suspect the past three years with him were all about a gigantic Man City conspiracy.

4269~~~
Glad to see his mother and father stopped posting here in his support. Consider: a comparison of the average number of points scored per United game when certain players played (last season):

Bastian:    1.73
Fellaini:    1.51
Young:    1.8
Mata: 1.74

Notice how low it gets with Fellaini?  Yet the whole excuse for playing him is he's supposed to be <i>effective</i>.

4270~~~

4274~~~
Fantastic stats.

I hope Mourinho sees this and realizes we need to start Ashley Young. He's clearly the most effective of the lot. We should also ensure Rojo starts every game for us given our record with him in the team is much better. Who needs Luke Shaw? Maybe Romero ahead of De Gea as given his clean sheet/game record is better as well. You might be onto something here

4275~~~
Is he still with us?

He would be first out the door, and before the door would close I would like to push Rooney out with him

4276~~~
Rooney is one of United's more effective performers.  United average 1.85 points when Rooney plays.

4277~~~
He also needs to learn how to run fast, jump high, win headers, tackle, keep his rancid elbows down, learn to pass the ball more than 10 yards, learn to pass the ball forward, score.... & get a hair cut. 

Maybe Mansour played 95% of the games in Fellaini's place this past 3 years.

4278~~~
Sold.yet?
