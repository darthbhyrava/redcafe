He's got some proper eyebrows on him doesn't he! Think he will have a big year this year.

3~~~
If that's his 1st performance then I expect another injury filled season with the villagers bringing out their pitchforks.

4~~~
At least he doesn't pluck them. That would be right behind chest shaving in my list of top 10 reasons why men are turning into effeminate, self-absorbed douchebags and we're all doomed.

5~~~
Hope he can stay relatively injury free and gets a decent shot.

As happy as I am with the signings we are making I can't help but feel United's British talent could be under serious threat.

6~~~
I hope we wont see 'omg how fat is he' or 'he's injured cause he has a fat ass' posts or we'll see a lot fewer ot those than last season.

7~~~
He's going to be class this season if he can stay fit. He looked very good when he played last season and that was without being able to get any consistency to his game time. 

People go on about our defensive frailty , but Shaw, Darmian and Smalling are three quarters of a very good defense.

8~~~
How fat is that chap? I reckon the only reason he's always injured is because he can't stay away from a McDonalds. Bring out the pitchforks!

9~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10~~~
He's fast become my new favorite player at the club, really hope that he gets a good run with no injuries this year.

11~~~
Really hope he's put the injuries behind him. If he can stay injury free, he'll have a fantastic season.

12~~~
My expectations towards him are higher than any other young player in our team.

13~~~
It's funny but, if you post it ten or twenty times in different threads, it will suddenly become the new orthodoxy. That's how the Caf works.

14~~~
I struggle to imagine him not becoming one of our best players and one of the best fullbacks in the league. Might take time, but barring a career-limiting injury, it'll happen.

That moment against Chelsea where, full sprint, he took down a long Carrick (I think?) pass and simultaneously beat Ivanovic all with one touch. You simply can't produce a touch like that without being a special player.

And he's living proof that football intelligence and actual intelligence are <i>not</i> the same thing. Thick as two short planks, but his decision-making on the pitch is delightful for such a young player.

15~~~
A fit Luke SHaw is already the best LB in the league imo.

16~~~
Well, probably. Since Baines has started to decline and allowing that Azpilicueta is a mostly defensive player in a superb Mourinho defensive unit. But it would be nice to see it for a whole uninterrupted season before making that claim. Otherwise it's really just theoretical.

17~~~
Hide the twinkies.

18~~~
Didn't see the match. How'd he do?

19~~~
He impressed me. Looked positive all the time and a good thread down the left, didn't take too many risks and showed good pace and strength throughout.

20~~~
He's one signing I was never worried about, the lad oozes class and is years ahead of his age in terms of development. Everyone seemed to get some sort of injuries when training under LVG's new thinking so once he strengthens accordingly we'll see the proper Shaw.

21~~~
I like his dribbling. He knows he has pace to burn so he ambles forward, inviting opposition players to close him down and uses the space they leave behind. 

It's kinda like Valencia does only he bottles the bit where you actually push it into said space and switch on the afterburners.

22~~~
Put it this way, Blackett was a lot more impressive at left-back in the 2nd half than Shaw in the first. One of them conceded a crazy freekick right on the edge of our box for a needless push after a long ball; it wasn't Blackett. About 1 min 22 secs into the clip of all his touches below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t7e7EZ5muLI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

23~~~
that faul wasn't even a faul, the ref was clown, wasn't impressive but a first game, more moments like that at 1:50, he doesn't look like someone who is fast but when he runs he's really fast. Blackett did well

24~~~
Another season of almost none attacking impact and I hope we sign his real competitor. Does he live in the 80's? He's great defensively but has literally no creativity whatsoever in him. He is fast, can dribble, a smart olayer but he hesitates too much on the ball. Needs to sort it out ASAP. You cant play possession football with non existent FB's.

25~~~
You are right, he isn't very good with his final ball and doesn't have the tricks & technique of Evra. However, his [extreme] speed, directness & tendency to overlap means he can still be dangerous going forward. I also think that he's so good defensively, that it is worth the trade-off. Just watch his performance against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - he's obviously capable of being an attacking outlet, it's just a matter of consistency (as well as improvement in his final ball) for him.

I do think he will improve over time, though. He already has the defensive side of his game nailed down, so I am sure the coaches know they can afford to try and develop his technical side as much as possible - he's still so young, and it is his first time playing for a team where he will be on the front foot more than the back. I imagine we'll see a much more well-rounded player in three or four years.

26~~~
He has a lot of potential, I dont think anyone can doubt that. But he is in a way attackingly a hindrance to us. With the football we play, teams sit back and there's just no space in the middle. Because of that we should utilize the space out wide very well. Just watch how Barca does it with Alba and Alves, they cross, linkup, create space for wingers that's what we need to create more chances and raise the tempo. Last season Shaw and Valencia were just very lacking in this area whilst being very solid players. I think for Soton Shaw was better attackingly than he's for us now. Although against Chelsea, City, and Crystal Palace he had very good displays on attacking and defensive side, that shows promise.

27~~~
I am still amazed by the maturity and confidence he has at his age.  He looks very much like a veteran fullback.

28~~~
The amount of criticism here is incredible. People are forgetting his age and the potential he clearly has.

29~~~
It's only that his potential doesnt play in the field at the moment, there's some standards a starter for United has to reach to play week in and out. In attacking aspect Shaw just isnt reaching that. Playing talents is important, but the FB position is just so important in our style of play that we cant keep playing somebody there just because he has potential. If it doesnt change soon, you have just hindranced yourself for a while because you basically wait for potential to be fulfilled. With the importance of that position and our ambition to be amongst the best in the world, it doesnt look ideal to me.

30~~~
Agreed. Plus I think, and I also think Van Gaal would agree that the fact he can defend first and foremost is more important than his attacking capabilities (which will improve). Valencia being a constant over Rafael sort of shows that. 

Hopefully Shaw can stay injury free, he is much better than Blind at left back.

31~~~
I agree with Sammyjunn on this, I was hoping to see that he can replicate that Chelsea performance on a regular basis and especially against lesser sides he should look threatening as an attacking outlet in his own right. 

Really needs to up his game for in a technical sense and make more braver decisions on the ball, cut the passing back out.. try and cut in and use your midfielders so the momentum of the attack is still kept.  Needs to work on his right foot.

32~~~

33~~~
This. He is already amazing at 20 and he's going to get better and better.

34~~~
Blackett didn't get forward once to help pereira from what I can remember, he just stood in the LB position and let him get doubled up on. Shaws "push was not even proper contact, he backed into him and when he held him off he hit the floor. That isn't a foul but he conned the referee. You can't blame Shaw for a stupid ref. apart from that he defended very well and supported the attacks, it was a solid but not spectacular performance.

35~~~
From the sounds of things some of you guys would hate Azpi. I swear that guy doesn't even overlap.

36~~~
The criticisms of his attacking contribution are valid, but I'm pretty confident that by the end of the season we'll be wondering why we were so worried. A season of regular first team football, the natural development that comes with it and the confidence of being a starter for United will see him really grow into the role this season. I'm certain of that.

37~~~
I'd second that man

38~~~
I enjoyed that 1 2 with Young at about 1.50 where he just glides past the opposition. He doesn't look quick but runs past people for fun.

39~~~
Shaw still getting criticised on here.......shocking!

I guess he is just one of those players.

40~~~
Im really impressed with that story about him and Januzaj taking a fitness trainer on holiday with them, seems to have an impressively mature attitude. Really hope he can put the injury problems behind him this season, he's pretty much a nailed on starter for me when he's fit.

41~~~
45 minutes of the first game in pre-season, a game that is simply about getting fitness back to normal levels.

Relax.

42~~~
Agreed. Hopefully that work he's put in during the summer will help him to have a good season.

43~~~
He is no Marcelo or Dani Alves but he does have the tools to become a good attacking wing-back, albeit not an overly technical one. He has excellent pace, decent ball-control and is always willing to go on overlaps and stretch opposition. It's also harsh to judge him on the back of his injury-strewn debut season where he did look a bit tentative and reserved, if you will. Expecting much more from him this season as he would be more settled down now.

Tbh, I'd much rather have a FB who has the defensive aspects of his game nailed down, as opposed to your modern day technical and talented but defensively inept FB. As it stands, Shaw can very well develop into a Zabaleta/G.Neville prototype who isn't the most technical or flashy of players, but someone who is always willing to contribute offensively with their engine and ability to stretch play whilst being a decent crossing option. Heck, even Ivanovich was able to make the transition from being a sturdy CB to a FB who was capable of decent attacking output. Point being that, whilst he obviously won't become a R.Carlos or a Brehme in the future, he can still become a top notch well-rounded FB who can contribute offensively. He certainly has the tools and the right manager who can take his game to the next level.

44~~~
Football fans. So impatient nowadays. He's 20 and had a season plagued with injuries. One preseason game and its - if he doesnt get better soon..

45~~~
Thank goodness people like you are around here at the Caf because sometimes I think this forum is dominated by 16 year olds who haven't understood what life's actually about. Patience is a virtue fast disappearing in this world.

46~~~
This x 100.

The lad is a star.

47~~~
I didn't know I had OCD, but all the different styles of thread titles for the players is really annoying me. Some have dashes (-) and some have these things | to separate the name and the "2015/16 performances"... which is also written as "performances 2015/16" for some players, occasionally having a dash instead of a "/".

I'm going mental.

48~~~
That's true. Perhaps in a pure counter-attacking team, he would be lethal going forward even without the skill that other attacking full-backs possess. Our system means that he has to actually handle the ball in tight spaces and (occasionally) beat a player from a stand-still. He probably isn't very suited to this right now, and it will take time for him to get used to LVG's style. That said, I don't think it's a problem that he looked better going forward for Soton. They relied a lot on full-back play, and he was one of the bigger names in the team. Here at United, we play a patient, passing game where there are 5 or 6 names in the team that will all be relied on more than him to provide attacking impetus. It's only natural that he takes a backseat for now.

I think we'll just have to see how he adapts as this season progresses, and revisit this topic in December (assuming he plays a lot) - he definitely has a lot of work to do, but his potential is massive. I think if he is lucky with injuries and keeps on developing, he can become one of the best full-backs in the world, if not the best (in several years, of course). We'll have a better indicator of his ability this season, after a run of games behind a consistent left-side player (probably Depay).

I rate him as our biggest youth prospect right now, assuming DDG doesn't count. He is such a natural defender, with so many useful qualities.

49~~~
I think Shaw will be our most improved player this season and could give us an extra dimension in attack.

50~~~
Thanks for the replies. So the opinions of his performance range from impressive to a lot worse than Blackett with more replies siding with the latter view. 

I like the article about him bringing trainer with him on holiday. Both he and Januzaj approaching this season as an important one and hope they both stay fit and flourish.

51~~~
Are you his .. ? Just kidding <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>, I agree with you, even if he hasn't been that impressive since his arrival, Shaw has so much time to develop into a cracking player for Man Utd. Preseason (specially the first match) is all about regaining match fitness anyway.

52~~~
Normally I prefer defensive full backs myself too, but for the setup LVG maintains attacking full backs are so important. Just look at Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern, they've got respectively Alba, Alves, Marcelo, Carvajal, Alaba, Lahm. It's no coincidence that they're all full backs who are very strong offensively and very good in possession, and with slight differences all these teams play quite similar football. And that's the way we're heading too. Chelsea play different football so they dont really need that for example.

Im not trying to slate him or not rate him, but he just has to improve offensively. Not basing this on the pre season match, but on the entire last season. Lets see if he does.

53~~~
If you are basing this on last season you would say that he's really good at attacking especially against Chelsea, they had no idea how to counter his pace on that left side. He created a sitter for Rooney in the beginning of the game which he missed and many other chances throughout the game.

54~~~
What sort of standards should he be performing to? How have you judged him? His first season was spent played erratically and injury riddled. If we truly wish to see how good he is or can be, we should be using this season to do it. 

Regarding the part in bold; the only way any player develops is by playing. What other full back would you realistically swap Shaw with that we could sign without needing to gel another play into the squad? He's more than good enough for me to start at left back where we can afford him maximum experience to grow. Also, we have players who can rotate with him in that position in the event of a slump in form, like Blind and Rojo.

55~~~
Did we play just one match in the season? As already sad, vs Crystal Palace, City and Chelsea he had great offensive displays. But generally, his attacking influence was quite small.

56~~~
What standards? Defensively he is perfect to me, but attackingly he needs to be able to cross, pass opposition in 1 vs 1's ocassionaly, link up with our winger to create space for himself and our forwards. He needs to maintain width with our wingers in order for the centre to be less crowded.

If we get Moyes back or sign Klopp, Shaw is the perfect LB. Under LVG though, quite much is expected of FB's in attacking sense, and that's the shame for Shaw. So I really hope he improves in this area because he's a fantastic prospect, if he doesnt we may need someone who's quite good in this area on occasions. Could be Blind / Rojo but Im not certain about their future here.

57~~~
Great attitude from him and Adnan, you can't ask more than that especially from young players these days, I think he'll cement his spot this season.

58~~~
I agree. All 3 have world class potential.

59~~~
He did all those things to a very high level last season. He just barely played because of the injuries.

60~~~
The fullbacks are probably the part of van gaal's philosophy that might be under change. You look at his comments about Mcnair being a Long term RB; and the first pre-season game back; both blackett &  Mcnair play at LB &  RB respectively.  Two defensive minded fullback's playing a proper flat back line. 

Likewise Shaw will consistently be under duress because i honestly think van gaal is experimenting under the job. 

I'm going to say the complete opposite and say that rather than Van gaal regarding shaw as offensively incomplete; his real problems arise from his approach to defending. It's his defensive positioning that will be the fundamental point of approach to attacking &
  thus far Blind has been a much better LB.

61~~~
I have all the time in the world for Shaw at the moment. I think he has the potential, and is going to be fantastic.

62~~~
Don't agree to that at all. It isnt that he has a bad cross per se for example, but he chooses to pass back and hesitate too much. I dont think he has good 1 vs 1 dribbling, but when he dribbles into space and gets going theres just no stopping him. He's extremely fast and strong and you cant just get it off him. He showed that vs Crystal Palace and also vs Club America. However when in standing positions with few space in front of him, he rather tends to pass the ball backwards. Not that he needs to be Hazard, but when teams sit back he just has a very tough time offensively, he's not the only one tho.

63~~~
Shaw will go onto be ours and England's first choice LB for the next decade or so, easily. He has the talent, it's just the application that needs to be worked on, and I have full faith that LvG will get the best out of him.

64~~~
It's perfectly normal to go back to basics and play it safe when you're lacking confidence. Once he's established himself in the team he'll start expressing himself. He's certainly not lacking technically. I think he's got a lot of similar qualities to Ashley Cole.

65~~~
That's true, he was injured a lot but why shouldnt he be confident? He was the LB of the year the season before, went to the WC, praised by a lot of people, signed for a big fee, and put in some wonderful defensive displays, doesnt that give you a lot of confidence in your ability? I think it's the only point he really has to improve, other than that he's just class for a LB and certainly at that age.

66~~~
But after he was signed for a big fee he got told he wasn't fit enough and picked up a few injuries over the course of the season which'd give him a knock in confidence.

67~~~
I really think too many people see footballers as robots or video game players these days. His life isn't solely limited to his footballing career. He was an 18 year old kid moving away from home for the first time, moving away from friends and family to a very different city a couple of hundred miles away and making a huge step forward in his career in every way (salary, expectations, environment, competition). That's moving very far outside of your comfort zone at a relatively tender age, and that takes some getting used to.

Within a few weeks of joining he'd already been told by his new manager that he's not in the right condition, his fitness isn't up to standard, and because of that he didn't make his debut until the end of September. That will knock anyone's confidence. That's then followed up by him getting repeatedly injured and seemingly proving his manager's criticisms to be true. That had all happened by around the halfway point in the season. Scolded by his manager (in public, to some degree), kept out of the first time for the first month of the season, and then injured a couple of times by the end of November. Thereafter he played sporadically and got a couple more injuries and because of that never managed to pick up any real run of form. 

That'll affect anyone's confidence I'd have thought.

68~~~
Could all be good reasons for him not being most confident, although it isnt true that his family live in a different city. They moved along with him and he lives with them, he also said that he didnt even live with them in Southampton but he does now. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2827591/Luke-Shaw-content-life-Manchester-United-frustrating-start.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...life-Manchester-United-frustrating-start.html</a>. These things could have meant a dig in confidence but on the other hand I think he has endured a lot of things that can also boost your confidence. But I know feck all about how he feels, just not sure why that would per se affect his attacking game and not defensive game.

69~~~
Something about him that really rubs me the right way.

70~~~
You're being too harsh. Learning when and how to attack as a fullback comes with experience, and the only way he'll be able to get that is if we afford him playing time as our first choice, which I pointed out in the last post. Also, Shaw's hardly the reason the centre's crowded; I find it laughable that you even think so.

71~~~
Watching him live on Mutv training earlier, he still has such a huge backside, I don't know if it's a weight issue or just a natural build but you can't help noticing. Random comment I know.

Edit- Oh dear.

72~~~
I'd say he 'doesn't have good 1v1 dribbling' in the same way that Yaya Touré 'doesn't have good 1v1 dribbling.' I.e: just because he doesn't have Messi's body shape, doesn't mean he can't dribble. How many time did he cut right through the Chelsea defence to the dead ball line or into their box in that second fixture last season? He's not Evra, but then there's hardly a fullback in football at the moment who dribbles the way Evra could. Marcelo, maybe. Shaw dribbles the same way Alaba dribbles, or Carvajal does: with deft touches when running at full pace, and with the power to hold off an opponent's body when going past them. That's how a fullback should dribble, because if they're having to do it from a standing start a la Messi or Nani, they've mistimed their run.

As for his passing and crossing in attacking positions, I can't believe we're watching the same player. If anything I think his decision-making and ability to pick out a teammate once he's got himself into the position to deliver a pass/cross is his best attacking attribute. His balls cut back for a player on the edge of the box to shoot are consistently unerringly accurate.

73~~~
Where do you think that running power comes from. That's his build. If you fancy adding another arse to that tagline, check out a 100m sprinter like Tyson Gay.

74~~~
It's rather the opposite, most talented full backs in the modern day are strong offensively and learn the defensive side with experience. It's not because of Shaw that the centre is crowded, that's because we play a possession based style. But FB's in our setup usually have the task to keep width in our play, and linkup or create space in wider areas in order to get the centre less crowded. However in my opinion, Shaw and Valencia havent done this adequately often enough last season.

75~~~
Never said he cant dribble, just that when it's crowded and he has players directly in front of him. He rather just passes the ball back than trying to dribble to create space. Baba, Gaya, Rodriguez, Alba, Alaba all of them have quite good 1 vs 1 dribbling as all of them bar Baba from what I know have played as LM.  I think that shows that they're dribbling for a full back to be able to play in that position. I dont think Shaw has the same dribbling as them, as his dribbling is more one directed and when he gets going just unstoppable, while the others mentioned are quite easier on the turn and a bit more agile.

It might be his best attacking attribute but that doesnt mean it's great, and there you make the point. It isnt that his pass or cross his bad, he just barely gets into those positions because of the quite lacking link up play many at times this season and his inability to get himself in those positions via dribbling. Not saying he should be di Maria, but you've seen us this season, teams just sit back and it's so crowded. In order to break that your full backs who are very advanced in possession, require quite some ability to be dangerous and vital in our attacking play. As said earlier, if Shaw played for Chelsea (although they played more possession football last season than usual) or in an older United team with a more direct attack. He'd just be monstrous, his pace, strength, composure, directness is immense for a full back of his age. But the technical skills become much more important in a LVG set up.

76~~~

If you can be arsed to watch, in this video I think you see the highlights of Shaw's season. Some great defensive actions, real class. When it comes to the attack too, but mostly of those attacking actions is when he gets played unto the ball with pace or when he has space in front of him, he's just unstoppable. He's so fast and strong and puts himself well between the ball and the defender. The action where he shrugged of Drogba for example, space in front of him and he just burst into the box and puts in a decent ball. It's situations like at 4:14, 4:27, 4:31, 4:40 that I want to see more of him. Players in front of him, but he tries to dribble past them, tries to dribble in the positions where he could make something happen. He showed this at Soton so I guess he has the ability, but he needs to show it more for me, and especially against teams who fully sit back unlike Everton and Chelsea in those examples. It's his first season tho, so lets hope he shows it for us or at least improves this season in that aspect. 

Shawly it's been enough Shaw for me today.

77~~~
Happy days Aaron.

78~~~
And yet as you keep pointing out yourself it's his offensive game that's lacking. Experience works for both.

79~~~
His decision making in the attacking areas is rather appalling. Did play a very good ball to Depay to end the half though.

80~~~
Great first half from him.

Almost involved in all of our best attacks.

81~~~
He's squared like 3 balls that Rooney, Memphis and Young have completely swung and miss. He should have got an assist off of everyone of them.

82~~~
Very good half, some great driving runs and overlaps and should had a couple of assists if the finishing had been on point, great to see him looking fit and confident.

83~~~
Very good today and you can really see why we were willing to pay so much for him.

84~~~
He was great, I hope this is what we can expect of him weekly in the near future.

85~~~
Final ball really needs work, but he's insanely talented. Looking great so far.

86~~~
great display from him. happy hes getting a good preseason

87~~~
I hope he uses his more pace more often when the actual season begins, like he did today. Last season, I thought he was way too passive, and didn't really look to attack, which was disappointing. He has the talent and ability, just needs to have the confidence and the aggressive mindset to attack.

88~~~
Terrific.

He's a fantastic left back and will show it this time around, avoiding injuries.

89~~~
Looks very fit and good. Wish his crossing would improve though; he needs to work on it, especially when he is on the run.

90~~~
I thought his balls into the box were fine on the whole, more good than bad and could have easily bagged a couple of assists if the finishing was there. Also good to see him always looking for the overlap and making the most of his pace to get in behind, good link up with Young.

91~~~
He tries to pull the ball pack or find a pass rather than put in a traditional cross. Worked out quite well at Southampton

92~~~
He is in great shape, absolute beast physically. His decision making was fine for a fullback, will improve if he hopefully stays fit.

93~~~
He's not fat or something, but can he even get more quick and pretty much as strong if he gets even more leaned/ripped?

94~~~
Please stay fit. X 1000

95~~~
He could prove to be vital for us this season if he stays fit. Pretty much all of our best stuff came from the left with him involved.

96~~~
Stay fit. That's all.

97~~~
exactly, nothing wrong with that kind of crossing, as long as he doesn't hit the first player I think it's okay and effective enough, with the mobile midfield again arriving late in the box is as dangerous as it gets. Once fellaini's there more crosses should be put in the box

98~~~
Even at his age he's probably the best left back in the league when fit. Great defensively, and very good at running forwards with the ball. Just needs to improve the final ball but it's definitely a lot better then it was last year IMO.

99~~~
I'm gonna stick my neck out and say he'll win our player of the season this year.

100~~~
He's bloody brilliant.

101~~~
Between him and Young I expect lots of good service from the left side this season. 

I think that's the reason why Memphis may be used as a number 10.

102~~~
I don't think anyone is surprised by how good he has looked so far this pre-season.

Since the day we signed him, the only thing stopping him from becoming a top class left back for many years to come was his injuries. It's the reason United spent close to £30m on him.

Very impressed that he and Januzaj maintained their fitness training throughout their summer break. Shows a lot of professionalism.

103~~~
his display really put blackett's into perspective. blackett was on the ball an awful lot yesterday but couldn't really do anything with it. shaw on the other hand was excellent.

104~~~
So, are there still people that think he can't attack?

105~~~
His burst of pace is really good to watch. Just accelerates so quickly and goes by opposition players like they are not even there.

106~~~
He'll always be called 'fatty' and so on, he's got that type of physique, but he's looked very sharp physically so far. Hope he stays fit.

He payed well the last couple of outings, seems relaxed off the field and seems to be getting on well with Memphis off the pitch, lets hope they can connect just as well down that left hand side for us for the next several years.

Did anyone catch the interview between them the other day? they were responding about the taunts of their <i>*Special Friendship*</i> going around on social media, they played it down but then ended the interview with Memphis declaring Shaw calls him <i>-Massive-</i> I've never seen Shaw facepalm so hard and so fast. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

108~~~
This.

109~~~
Our very own Patrice was great at getting forward, a world class fullback, without ever being particularly good with his end product. 

While goals and assists are obviously brilliant, it's invaluable to have a fullback that can push back the opposition flanks. It creates so much space.

110~~~
But I don't know where this myth that Shaw's end product is bad has even come from. Those cut-backs along the ground towards the player arriving from the edge of the box are almost always perfect. Against San Jose we managed to shank at least three that deserved to be assists. It was the same in that game against Chelsea when he shone. If anything to me his final ball (and decision making at high speed) has always been his strongest attacking asset.

111~~~
Yep, it's like Lampard managed to get called fat throughout his whole career. A bit embarrassing really.

112~~~
I think at the start of last season he was way too cautious in terms of making runs down the left and didn't pick his moments properly. That was the biggest thing, but that improved really quickly. If he stays fit, I have no doubt in my mind that he's the best and most complete left back in the league already. Azpilicueta might be the best at the moment, but that's because he is consistently fit. Shaw is quality at both ends of the pitch, compared to Azpilicueta who is just mostly defensive.

113~~~
From last season, when his delivery from wide areas was generally poor. He looked very inhibited, though, always taking the most conservative option. So it's no great surprise he wasn't able to do much buckling of his swash. Dunno if that was nerves, or instructions from the manager but hopefully he'll take a few more risks in and around the opposition box this season.

114~~~
Maybe at the start of the season, but for most of it I found quite the opposite.

115~~~
Same, he usally attempts to pick some one out, rather than fling an aimless ball in, and hes usually good at it too

116~~~
Dude's a warrior. Going to be absolutely wicked for us this season I reckon.

117~~~
He has serious talent. No idea why he isn't rated by some here

118~~~
Struggled to settle in last season with all the injuries and with the price tag think people were expecting a young Maldini. Promising signs towards the end of last season and preseason so far though.

119~~~
There is some impatience when it comes to very young players.

120~~~
Anyone who thought he would fit in straight away and be the finished product is an idiot. We paid a lot of money for potential, not a finished player

121~~~
That's the nature of the modern fan though it seems.

122~~~
Looks like. You see it that every tiny little decision by LVG is commented by drama queens on here

123~~~
His bursts from deep are so exciting. Comes late like a fecking Bullet train.

Just needs to improve bit of his decision making.

124~~~
He needs to avoid injuries and to just keep improving his work in the attacking third of the pitch. Looking like he is in for a very good season though.

125~~~
Agreed with <a class="username" data-user="83951, @ZDwyr" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83951/">@ZDwyr</a> - needs to avoid injuries (although of course that can be said for every player). But im happy we signed him and nothing convinces me otherwise that he wont be here for years to come. He links up well with Young tbf.

126~~~
I've always maintained he will be a great buy for us and he looks fit, strong and full of confidence on this tour, I'm expecting a big season from him.

127~~~
Still only 20, can be one of the best fullbacks in the league again last season like he was at Southamton

128~~~
People need to remember he's just turned 20 years old lol.

By the time he's early 20s (22, 23 etc) he will be a beast.

Maybe even before then.

129~~~
seems like a great player in the making. that being said worried about the way hes shaped. seems like his knees will eventually suffer because of his build.

130~~~
Please stay fit and injury free next season, I'm really excited to see what he can do when he gets an extended run of games. Great talent.

131~~~
Stay fit and we are sorted.

132~~~
Seems like van Gaal really rates Shaw, full of praise in latest interview. Even says this will be his season. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

133~~~
Quotes?

135~~~
Think he could be one of our stand out performers this season if he stays fit

136~~~
Didn't realise he was 20. Thought 21/22. Fantastic

137~~~
He made PL team of the season aged 18.

138~~~
He really is good tbf.

139~~~
Stays fit and he'll claim best LB in the league.

140~~~
I just hope that the papers stop using the headline "Its a Shaw thing". I have seen the same headline splashed across many papers at least 3-4 times

141~~~
His runs forward have looked much better this pre season, both in quantity and quality. Honestly think he'll feel like a new signing if he stays fit.

142~~~
Great performance today. With him and Darmian, we certainly have our defensive wings sorted. Now ffs get the centre sorted!

143~~~
Looks 100 times fitter. I remember how cumbersome he looked last pre-season, now he's racing through midfields with ease. Can really see this being his year.

144~~~
Was very good today. Thought it looked like he enjoys playing with Pereira. Provides really good overlap with Young too.

145~~~
Another tidy appearance by him today. Our full backs not getting involved enough was a major problem last season but with Darmian and (a fit) Shaw, we should hopefully eradicate that problem.

146~~~
That was pretty good from the lad.

Everytime we were playing retarded back passes he was coming back with a solid runs forward to gain territory.

147~~~
One of the brightest aspects of the tour is how fit and strong he's looked, his acceleration is electric when he drives at defenses and he doesn't panic when he gets into the final third.

148~~~
Hope the lad works on his end product. He puts in a lot of effort to move forward. Needs to work on finding better passes and crosses.

149~~~
Looks improved on last year.  His fitness work is showing.  Definitely showing an eye to get forward.

If the team can continue to work the ball up quickly, he'll be a real attacking asset--maybe like Rafael '12-13.  In turgid passing and build up displays like we often saw last year, he won't be able to contribute as much.

Completely agree about injuries.  I have no idea how at 19 last year he was so often injured, but surely he won't repeat that...If he stays for he's going to make leaps of improvement.  Real talent this one.

150~~~
Probably impressed me most out of everyone on the tour. Think I will enjoy watching him this season.

151~~~
Me too. Darmian has impressed as well but I think Shaw has looked even better.

152~~~
Our fullbacks have been our best performers in preseason. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> With him and Darmian we've got our flanks sorted for many years but we're still very weak through the middle. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

153~~~
Has had a very good pre season, better going forwards and great defensively. Hope he can stay fit this season, could go on to be the best LB in the PL very soon. Still hope the end product gets better, but Rooney for example doesnt make it that easy for him. His runs inside the box arent as good or frequent as they once were

154~~~
We suffered a great deal in going forward last year from our full backs but those problems seem to be addressed now if both full backs can stay fit, I think people forget how important full backs are in the teams attack.

155~~~
He's looked really good in pre season. Just hope he can stay fit.

156~~~
Sitting out the U21's and taking that physio on holiday seem to have done the trick, early days but I'm confident he'll have a lengthy run.

157~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2552017/luke-shaw-rescues-man-utd-fans-kit-error" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2552017/luke-shaw-rescues-man-utd-fans-kit-error</a>

Good guy. Really hope he's managed to get his fitness issues behind him. Excited about him this year.

158~~~
Good performance. This guy celebrated 20 years a month ago! He will be amazing for us for many years to come.

159~~~
Thought he was good today alright.

160~~~
Was good, but he's had better matches. Especially defensively.

161~~~
Awful today. Just awful. Seems to me that i didn't watch same game as others. In attack he didn't provide anything. 0 runs, 0 crosses, ball always back to blind. 
More important- defence. He lost player couple of times. darmian is example how you must defend your area.
And he has 5 kg extra.

162~~~
Oh good I'm glad this is back

163~~~
I think it's clear he's past it, and has already peaked.

164~~~
Really? He wasn't that bad, thought he looked Ok, showed his athleticism , he will be good for us if he can stay fit.

165~~~
Eh? He wasn't awful at all.

166~~~
Incredible how you manged to assess his exact body weight gain via the television screen.

I think we've found a new niche in obesity development.

167~~~
Decent performance. Nothing more, nothing less. Still confident he will be very good this season though. Great talent.

168~~~
Huh? He lost a scrap with Kane once. What else?

169~~~
He wasn't awful, but he wasn't great today. Thought he was ok. I know he's got a lot more in his locker, though.

170~~~
I think there is a real possibilty you literally were watching another game.

171~~~
Look 
I fecked up, that with the weight was a joke, but seems to me, bad joke. But for performance today i think that he was bad.

172~~~
Fair enough. I thought he was generally solid, but he can do a lot better, yes.

173~~~
Thought he was just reserved, blind next to him, Kane working that channel and Walker being a threat when he can

174~~~
He wasnt bad. Not going to say he was great, but im happy we have him. I honestly think he would do so much better linking up with memphis on the left.

175~~~
He was ok but I thought looked a bit over eager at times, just needs to relax and play his game.

176~~~
Yeah well said, he might have been instructed to just sit back a bit and help out blind. He's definitely got potential to be better and I think if he remains fit could be our player of the season

177~~~
He was quite decent IMO. Not sure why people think otherwise.

He's an unstoppable train once he starts running as well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

178~~~
I thought he was our joint worst performer of the starting 11 (along with Rooney).

179~~~
Nothing special but certainly not bad,bad,like really really bad like certain poster has pointed out.

180~~~
I think the criticisms today are harsh.  He could've showed more ambition going forward but he was generally okay on the defensive end.  It would probably be helpful for him if Blind wasn't vacating his area so often and leaving Shaw to guard the left on his own.

181~~~
Decent performance from Shaw today. Defensively he looked solid, not sure how much his attacking instinct is being held back by LvG. Best thing about today was he completed 90 minutes without suffering an injury.

182~~~
Felt Young ignored him a couple of times too many

183~~~
Young provided little creativity input on the left. I hope LVG tries Depay on the left and Pedro on the right as we need pace and unpredictability on the flanks

184~~~
He kept trying to get past Walker (which just wasn't going to happen), and completely ignored Shaw who was in a good position on a couple of times.

185~~~
I think that Young and Mata (he's a good player but lacks the pace needed for a winger) are the reason why we struggled to create chances today. Its quite a shame as I feel we've got the talent to solve this creativity drought once and for all, especially if we do sign Pedro.

186~~~
He's fantastic.

Some of you are weird.

187~~~
Nah, he was awful really. He seemed lost for the most part today.

188~~~
I know that people can't really digest more than a few mail and mirror "SHOCK Fat Luke's HUGE fullback issue" headlines and a some random tweets from gormless bell-ends these days.

But I am surprised nobody has really mentioned this; When we played in pre-season he was free to run down the flank and actually used his own creativity and instincts to get up and link up well with Young. It is one of the first things I noticed in pre-season that looked odd to me. "Luke Shaw is just bombing up the field and it looks out of place..?" He kind of reminded me of Evra, when Evra would just bomb up field and then jog back (not so much the jogging back but the bombing up field).

He didn't do this at all last night. I guarantee you in between the PSG game and today Van Gaal has had a word to him "no more bombing up the line now that the season has started" he played a support role nearly identical to Darmian today where he'd centre the ball and support the midfield rather than run with the ball and use the midfield to support Young.

I really don't see a point in playing fullbacks if they aren't allowed the freedom to get forward and support the attack. He's a young lad, just tell him to use all of his energy to get back and cover. Frustrating.

189~~~
Defensively decent, I forgot who was even playing on that flank for the Spurs most of the game but what bothered me most was he did not once overlap Young to make life easier for him when Walker was right up in his shirt. You give Evra a sniff of that and he would be creating havoc on that flank.

190~~~
You can't make something up as you go. Blind defended well yesterday and didn't 'vacate the area' at all

191~~~
He was good, anyone who says not were clearly not watching him properly or not at all.

192~~~
He did, actually. At least a couple of times, most notably when Chadli (?) was wrongly called offside. Positionally he's an absolute liability there

193~~~
So you can guarantee then that conversation happened between LvG and Shaw, even though there's no fecking way you could absolutely know that it happened or not?

Excellent stuff.

194~~~
Lol no, preseason and competitive games are very different. He plays a supporting role because he doesn't have the same confidence against better opposition in a difficult competitive match as in a friendly preseason game. Give him time to develop his technique better and we may see better attacking gameplay from him. That or if Young cuts in more often, Shaw will get more opportunities to make those runs. 


Which is why the team which won the world cup used his defensive positioning as a case study?

195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

196~~~
Chadli was played on by Schneiderlin. Don't know how can you blame Blind there. His intention was to play him off and he did but for Schneiderlin. 

Besides this there may be utmost one other instance where he wasn't positionally good. He was solid otherwise especially people who thought Kane or eriksen would bully him would have been disappointed.

197~~~
feck sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

198~~~
Shaw was fine yesterday. Had that one bad moment where Kane nicked the ball off him but otherwise he was solid defensively.

199~~~
I thought he had a good game, not sure what people expectof him.

200~~~
Was excellent yesterday.

201~~~
So if he rarely gets forward for the first half of the season can we assume that conversation transpired? If you want to be literal of course.

202~~~
Not sure what you're on about. Whenever the ball went out to our left side, Shaw was there.

203~~~
Re-read my post for a the explanation.

204~~~
I freaking love Shaw. Barring injuries, he is equipped to become one of the three best left backs in the world.

205~~~
Did you watch Darmian's performance? Got forward loads and singled out by the manager for praise afterwards. How does that fit with your theory?

206~~~
Shaw was ok. I seem to remember him letting a couple of players get past him a bit too easily but he wasn't poor overall. Still one I'm excited about this season.

207~~~
was decent overall , still can't get how he is possibly that fast with that fat ass. Pacey fecker.

208~~~
I see all those comments about shaw. " excellent", "very good", etc... And attacks on me because i trashed shaw after this game.
People, we are talking about full back of manchester united. Not full back of luton or preston.
Full back on top stage in top club must be flawless in defence and provide something in attack. Did you see darmian yesterday.? He controled his space, tackled fantastic, in attack he had runs, crosses, etc...
Luke shaw didn't do anything like that. Performance like his can do any full back in league. And couple of times he lost his man and was out of position also. In attack his game was to pass ball to first player near him.
And that excuse ' "he is young  and talented" is bullshit. He will be young player next season and season after that also so when we will start to see him as a grown player who must live with his price and standards of man utd?

209~~~
I am trying to get the 442 Stat Zone maps but for some reason I can on my phone but not on my browser. Neither really got forward a lot, that was my point. Shaw's lack of support for Young seemed calculated. Mata naturally drifts inside for Darmian which in my opinion leaves a lot more room for Darmian to make runs. However, the way he cuts inside leaves a lot of execution on the timing of the runs so as not to be caught up field which I can see LVG clearly doesn't want each fullback to be.

210~~~
LVG specifically mentioned attacking fullbacks when we signed Darmian

211~~~
I'm not talking about Darmian in this instance, I'm talking about Shaw. They mirrored in influence, Shaw seemed a lot more eager to get on the ball, take it forward and link up with Young in pre-season and it looked odd to me, in this game he had no intention of even carrying the ball at all under any pressure. That was my original point, in this game it seemed he did not want to carry the ball at all. It seemed calculated.

212~~~
He carried the ball the whole way from left back to centre forward at one point. You're not making sense with stuff about Darmian either. 

It's quite possible that Shaw played a little bit more conservatively in his first big PL of the season than he did in a pre-season friendly. The massive leap you're making is deciding this is under instructions. This would mean he was ignoring those instructions in pre-season. Do you think Van Gaal would pick a player who ignores instructions?

213~~~
Just ask ADM <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

214~~~
It's called adjusting to circumstances of the game when it's appropriate to help out in the attacking third. Yesterday was likely not appropriate. You're jumping to conclusions it was a game plan.

215~~~
How will FBs play depends on the opponent too. If RB is bombing forward that doesnt mean LB should do it too.

216~~~
Having thought about it, yes it is a fair point. I may have had that round in the chamber and fired it off half cocked. 
Forget Darmian. I only used him as an example of the more conservative and measured buildup and overlapping play (in pre-season) in contrast to Shaw's pre-season more adventurous endeavour to link up and provide overlap and creativity with Young. As Sultan said, it was probably a tactical decision individually to support the back line as opposed to leaving it open. Rather than a word from the manager. We'll re-visit this when I can better explain my point.

217~~~
Hey hey hey my parents live there leave it out! <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

218~~~
Beginning to grow in his role .Rojo as some healthy competition. Unless LVG sees him as a CB.

219~~~
My man of the match. Was very good on both ends of the pitch for the full ninety minutes.

220~~~
totally agree looked good going forward with a few overlaps and was solid at the back, long may it continue.

221~~~
My Motm

He was perfect

222~~~
Great game.

223~~~
Another classy performance.

224~~~
Love the way he dribbles at full pace. And defensively solid. If him and Darmian stay fit, I think we may have the best pair of full backs in the league.

225~~~
Seems like his fitness levels are finally up! Run up and down all the time and was solid when defending and good going forward. I hope people realized that we paid 30mln for top potential

226~~~
My man of the match tonight.  Looks bigger, fitter and much better going forward - a beast in the making.

227~~~
He just looks so much fitter now! I think back to last season when he first came on in pre-season, he was a chunky lad that sweated his arse off after 5 minutes.

228~~~
Man of the match for me. I hope he'll make that LB his own for years to come like Evra did.

229~~~
Great display today. Absolutely rock solid and even though he is already performing at a very high level, you just feel that there still is much more to come from him.

230~~~
How fecking fit is this guy? Absolutely fantastic, he'll be immense for us if he stays injury free.

231~~~
He stayed back more when Delay was playing there but again pushed forward more when young came on. 

Class performance though.

232~~~
Great attitude and does his job so well, love how him and Darmian cover their CB's effortlessly if needed.

233~~~
I've been really confused over the summer looking at "Biggest flops" threads on other forums and seeing Shaw's name in there, the guy's an absolute beast and is only going to get better.

234~~~
Almost like a new signing if he stays fit. He could be the best LB in the league by the end of the season and he's only 20 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

235~~~
He was excellent. Maybe his best performance for us yet?

236~~~
Impressive today. Stays on his feet, positions himself reasonably well and is an asset going forward. probably should have an assist when he could have put it across goal rather than passing to a villa player on the pano spot. Still developing but carries all the good traits to be a top player for us.

237~~~
He was positionally excellent and I feel like he's still playing within himself a little bit. Such a promising player

238~~~
We have two fantastic wing backs. A joy to watch.

239~~~
He's feckin class. Our defense looks a lot more solid and himself and Darmian are the 2 main reasons behind that. Still a lot more to come from him and that's a scary thought.

240~~~
What a talent we have in Luke Shaw. Genuinely feels like a new signing.

241~~~
Agreed, he was fantastic.

242~~~
Agree. Lots of people voting Darmian as their Motm but I think Shaw was terrific. Did everything that could be asked of him. And people were slagging him off before the first game.

243~~~
For the record, above in the thread I thought today he showed more aptitude to get forward and support. I think it may have been tactical for Tottenham.

244~~~
I thought he was really good. My MOTM too.

245~~~
Really reminds me of young Evra. Committed, fast, good link up play, very good in attack, and reliable on defence. Seems like United and England's left back could be set for another 10 yrs.

246~~~
I know he's kinda slow but he is called Daley <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>.

247~~~
Quite sure he was talking about Memphis.

248~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

249~~~
He's one of those weird players where you just know he's going to be brilliant. The only thing stopping him is injury. 

He reminds me of Rooney a bit, just a left back version. Very young (in the team of the year at 18) but physically developed, so strong, fast and a great engine. He's got the lot.

250~~~
Really listened to the instructions to get forward on the overlap, supported Memphis well and I think the cut back ball he tried was the right idea which shows his decision making is coming along. I'd be satisfied with his current level if he was 25, the fact he's got 5 seasons before he reaches that age...

251~~~
He was ravaged by injuries last year.. His talent was always there, once he gets some games under his belt he is going to become a beast.. Just hope he remains injury free now.. Like Rafa, I feel injuries will be the only thing that ll stop him..

252~~~
Excellent defensively, and the way he carries the ball forward is just a joy to watch. 

Our two fullbacks are becoming my two favorite players

253~~~
My god people,what 2 fullbacks we have on our hands..

254~~~
Yeah haha it's nice isn't it. Teams can get away with having average fullbacks but you can definitely see the difference when both fullbacks are just about world class. Surely Shaw is our fastest player? He motors

255~~~
It's great. Shame they're obviously being pinned back a bit by Van Gaal's strategy. What our attacking play is really lacking at the moment is the overlapping runs from the fullbacks, and with two who are such good forward runners, you have to point the finger at Van Gaal there. Ok, that conservatism no doubt contributed to how rock solid we were at the back against Villa - Darmian in particular defended flawlessly - but when you're scoring 95% on your defending and 55% going forward, clearly you need to adjust the balance a bit, and giving Shaw and Darmian license to break forwards as they naturally would is the best way to do that. The reason our forwards are struggling is because it's so easy to mark three static forward players out of the game. Get defenders and midfielders running beyond them and suddenly they'll have much more room to play in.

256~~~
Physically such an imposing lad at the age of 20.

257~~~
The scheason of Luke Shaw has begun

258~~~
We've struck gold in our search for an Evra replacement. He'll end up as player of the season the way we're shaping up.

259~~~
My bad. Can only think of Blind when I saw the word delay <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>.

260~~~
This kid is world class. Full on beast mode so far this season.

261~~~
That pace <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

262~~~
I hope he can stay fit the whole of this season.

263~~~
He is class.

264~~~
What a performance tonight, truly outstanding. Memphis will get MOTM and rightly so but that run and pass to Rooney, with his right foot I might add, was absolutely stunning. Terrific performance!

265~~~
That run to cover his mistake across the pitch and then on to the whole right flank before that good cross to Rooney was wow. His quick breaks are great.

Memphis doesn't use him like Young does though.

266~~~
Beastmode. Outstanding performance.

267~~~
Holy feck is he fast. If he and Memphis can get on the same wavelength then that will be up there with the best of left flanks.

268~~~
He's a huge talent, Im so glad we have him. Imo just one step away of a world class LB. Think he'll thrive in the CL with all that space.

269~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

270~~~
Hard to believe he's only 20 years old, he plays like a seasoned pro

271~~~
He'd have been my MOTM if Depay didn't make that brilliant assist in the end.

He doesn't look 20 either.

272~~~
I actually think he was better overall than Memphis tonight, but gave MOTM to Memphis because it's hard to argue with two goals and an assist.

273~~~
The boy operates with a dual clutch, seamless transition through the  gears. What an athlete.

274~~~
I hoped he'd do Evra vs Roma there running on the right but he opted for cross(which was still good decision though).

275~~~
Excellent today - my MOTM because Memphis had an average 2nd half apart from the assist

276~~~
There were people saying absolutely stupid things about him last season. I never doubted him - he's worth all the money.

277~~~
This is a different player to last season. He did incredibly well considering Memphis doesn't really track back. He did it all on his own. So complete. 

Shame Memphis didn't get the hat trick, as all of Shaw's brilliance there will be forgotten as it amounted to nothing. That was some graft, and great run down the right.

278~~~
I came to this thread just to post about that run. He sprinted from left back to right back and then to right wing in how many seconds? I was out of breath just watching. 

Fitness coaches. All players. Every summer. Mandatory. We'd run every team not doping into the ground <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

279~~~
Run up and down like crazy. Super tonight despite one big mistake

280~~~
My MotM tonight. Beast. If Memphis wasn't so greedy and actually used Shaw's runs we'd probably have scored even more.

281~~~
Freakish pace.

A bit hot headed in terms of leaving his position actually today but largely excellent again. Kid is top class.

282~~~
Does somebody have a gif of that impressive sprint ? talking about the one where he layed of with his right to Rooney and Depay almost scoring his hattrick.

283~~~
He's fecking rapid. Love him. Pray to some imaginary figure that he stays injury-free.

284~~~
Shaw was a little sloppy in the beginning leaving too much space in behind him, thus giving Club Brugge some chances to be threatening. Other than that I loved his workrate and on ball defending. Great performance.

285~~~
Gif of that run on the right flank anyone?

286~~~
I just love the fact that after last season he looked off the pace,he took personal trainer on holidays,now he looks like our own Berry Allen.

287~~~
He's so damn quick, might be quicker than Smalling

288~~~
Fully agree. That performance at the Bridge made me a convinced man last season. Excellent today.

289~~~
Very proud of him tonight. Seems to be more comfortable now and that pace - unfecking believable!

290~~~
Excellent player for United. He is top quality. We are well sorted on the left wing.

291~~~
What a gem. If Memphis stays on the left, we could have something really special there over the next few years.

292~~~
He is quicker than Usain Bolt, let alone Mikey.

293~~~
Miss having a full back running up and down the wing making it his own.

294~~~
Besides that awful pass, he was really brilliant today! How old is he, imagine having the left back position sorted out for the next 13 years <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

295~~~
He's only 20...sky's the limit if he stays fit.

296~~~
Was getting ripped into by Owen in the commentary for the first half, ate his words in the second.

297~~~
He's been great in all 3 games so far, plus he looked good in preseason.

298~~~
Best player over the course of the 90 minutes today, but two goals and an assist will rightly steal the headlines. Probably our best player so far this season, along with Mike.

299~~~
He has looked like the player we thought we bought last summer.  That one run <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

300~~~
I was going to mention this in the thread. Mata gets a lot of flack on here about his defensive work (nowhere near as bad as some make out) but Memphis doesn't do whole lot of defending. The positive is that it makes us a threat on the counter.

301~~~
The season of Luke Shaw is looking to be better than the Summer of George.

302~~~
He is a lot quicker than Smalling with the ball at his feet.

303~~~
It's a bit funny how good he is, especially in 1v1 situations. And still so young. 

Stay fit and he's due a killer season

304~~~
I called it at the end of last season that this will be Shaw's season and so far he's proving me right! The fact some on here were negative and doubtful is beyond me.

305~~~
Wow, just wow. The speed on him is just incredible, and people say he's fat. Behave!

306~~~
He's scary good at times. Really impressed with his work tonight.

307~~~
Smalling's recovery pace is really something though. Shaw is blistering, no doubt. Supposedly faster than Walcott and Bale at Southampton.

308~~~
Tbh he has looked even better than that. I thought we bought a promising fullback, now he's on the verge of becoming an absolute monster.

309~~~
Where is the poster who said he wasn't quick? Must be one of the worst observations I have ever read.

310~~~
he's Barry Allen in disguise . He is quick for a supposed "fatty"

311~~~
Both him and Memphis are so young and talented that they have plenty of time to build up a terrifying partnership down that left flank.

312~~~
One thing for him to improve upon, he tries to be almost too precise with his crosses when he gets past the fullback, especially when he's right by the byline. Rooney made a few good runs in there tonight and sometimes he just needs to whip it in between the defence and the goalkeeper. He always seems to try and pick someone out, ends up getting blocked/pulled back too far and we are hit on the counter quite easily. It will come with experience though.

Only a minor gripe as he was really very good tonight.

313~~~
He's going to be a superstar.

314~~~
You have to be seriously quick leave everyone for dead down the wing, but to run across to the other side of the pitch first, it really was exciting too see.

315~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

316~~~
ANOTHER great performance. Enough said.

317~~~
He eats up the ground when he drives forward and I love how he deals with one on ones, I think he's shown not only the talent he has but the mentality after a very difficult first season on the back of a huge transfer fee. He can still improve in the final 3rd but I have no doubt he will overcome that as well.

318~~~
beast tonight

319~~~
He was charging in too much in the first half and in turn leaving space behind, a team with better quality would have exploited that a lot more than what Brugge did. Otherwise he was very good. Improved a lot in the second half, that recovery and then the run on the right was just sublime.

320~~~
It really is. He's enjoyable to watch. Him and Depay can be amazing on that left side!

321~~~
What a player.

322~~~
Any Gif of that amazing run?

323~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/7kjd" width="560"></iframe>

324~~~
Thanks!

325~~~
Also passed it with his weaker foot. Exciting talent indeed.

326~~~
Commentator on the stream I was watching seemed to be criticising him for leaving some space in behind. I thought it was a valid point too, but he still played well overall. Is just an absolute beast physically. Great run down the right also. Is going to be a great player for the next decade.

327~~~
An absolute beast, well worth the money from his current performances + his potential. How is he only 20 years old <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

328~~~
Unbeatable tonight. Absolute rapid turn of pace. Looks very fit. Onwards and upwards!

329~~~
It is weird how fast he is.

330~~~
Yes, he's shown that trait of being 'too' calm and measured more than a few times in the game last season against Chelsea and in pre-season. It's weird you would hope he actually learns something from Ashley 'fire it first time across the 6 yard box' Young.

Hopefully, the team can integrate him more into an attacking asset and he has the confidence to attack the box more with regards shooting/creating more promising angles other than his runs from deep. It's quite similar to how much of an attacking outlet Evra's runs was but we never really used him as the attacking force (he was more than capable of).

It was quite funny how he was the last man when we've taking a corner or free kick <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

"Luke you're last man, just make sure no one runs past you".

331~~~
This guy

332~~~
Playing with a lot of confidence, great to see.

333~~~
He's an absolute brute. Built like a brick shithouse and absolutely rapid.

334~~~
Roadrunner! it was like playing as Ronaldo in fifa against novice CPU.  

Will be no 1 fullback in the world, he's got the lot.

335~~~
Genuinely think he's faster then Bale... Incredible pace on show today from him

336~~~
Beast

337~~~
He's going to turn into Bale MKII, isn't he?

338~~~
That run from right was certainly encouraging.

339~~~
Agreed. One of his best attributes that gets overlooked is his first touch, he can take the ball down on his foot like he's Berbatov.

340~~~
On his current showing? Highly unlikely. 

People say Bale is a flat track bully but he has brilliant dribbling technique and abilty. He showed that as a full back for Southampton and Spurs. The move to push him further up the field was like a flicker switched turned on and it all came together.

I'm not saying Shaw doesn't have the ability but I don't think it's winger/forward attacking level (or rather hasn't been developed). His attacking forays are mostly deep runs and overlaps. Until we see more situations where he is facing one and one with a player and is able to regularly beat them with skill and dribbling moves, it's wishful thinking to think we have a potentially world class attacking forward. Not to mention those situations would be quite high risk moves for a full back and one whose manager demands defending first. 

Would Coleman, Alaba, Alves, Alba etc be able to produce what they do when they are mostly in the final third of the pitch with 30 yards of operating space compared to the 60 yards (and a supporting player) ahead of them right now? Probably but I doubt it would be elite level. Saying that Shaw could easily become a become winger than someone like Young, so yeah he could be very good/useful if his career goes down that path but I can't see Bale level yet.

341~~~
he does seem to have found an extra yard or two of pace from somewhere - seems that extra training has paid off

great game from him today, best player apart from Memphis

342~~~
I agree with all you've said, was more tongue in cheek than anything.

Don't forget Bale was always great at striking the ball as well.

343~~~
He's a different entity to Bale.. much more of a defender first, but he is a beast

344~~~
Seems a completely different and better player so far since the start of Pre-Season. Hope he can keep up the good work because he is looking fantastic at the moment.

345~~~
Good point. His first touch would be up there with the best in the squad.

346~~~
Its great to have debates over who the man of the match is again. You could have your pick from tonight. If it wasnt for Memphis being Memphis and Smalling being a rock, I'd have said Shaw. He was unreal.

347~~~
I hope we'll get to see Memphis and Shaw link up more in the future, too. It seemed like Shaw was being found by our midfielders more whenever he got forward. Memphis and Shaw could be a serious partnership on that left side.

348~~~
I just hope Giggs schools him on not always hitting the afterburners like that.  We need those hamstrings in one piece.

349~~~
Scary thing is, Memphis and Shaw have not yet formed a proper partnership, but they're already doing pretty well on that left side. Once they learn to play off each other, they'll be very difficult to stop.

But happy to finally see a bit of what we paid 27mil for.

350~~~
Very good performance and the right side run was brilliant but, stemmed from a wtf pass that put us in real trouble were it not for an errant touch by the Brugge player. 

Wish him and Darmian though would put in some more dangerous balls, they are the two providing the width most of the time, so our balls from out wide depend upon them a lot.

351~~~
A fullback we have been so craving for! He is lightning fast and will form a great partnership with Memphis. 

I like what he did last season, despite his share of injuries he concentrated on defending and now that it looks like that is sorted, he is going full beast mode on attacking. Blind has been covering well for him too!

352~~~
Probably going to be less of problem for Shaw, Giggs was slight and Shaw is an athlete

353~~~
I remember seeing one through ball go into his path, quite far ahead and I said "Jezus, where is that ball going" only for Shaw to casually run forward and pick it up. The kid is fast.

354~~~
I knew he was fast, but when he raced the Brugge defender for a seemingly impossible ball yesterday, I realize that I hadn't really seen him at full speed until then. Christ, he is fast.

355~~~
He should get a new contract soon. I know we signed him last year, but according to transfermarkt his contract will end already in 2018 and I don't want a situation where other clubs show interest next summer with him only having 2 years left.

356~~~
That speed of his is something else.

Also he's one of us (how do I embed Facebook posts properly?):

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/zGv3sB3.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/zGv3sB3.png"/>

357~~~
We probably have an option to extend it a further year to 2019, that being said I wouldn't worry about him with stuff like that. De Gea was always obvious but can see Shaw staying here for the rest of his career injuries permitting.

358~~~
I don't think that gif at the top of the page does his run justice. Didn't he start by running back the whole length of the field the other direction to win the ball? That was before running back the entire length the other way and creating a golden opportunity for Memphis to get his third.

Louis said this could be "the season of Luke Shaw." He might be onto something.

359~~~
Was brilliant last night and has been for the previous two games. Always knew he was quite fast but he looks absolutely rapid in these last few games. The main thing is keeping himself fit over the season and producing consistent performances. He's rock solid defensively and won't be beaten 1 v 1. In an attacking sense, I would like to see him have more confidence because he can beat a man and put a good ball in there's no doubt about that. When he receives the ball higher up the touchline, his first touch seems to come back rather than opening up his body ready to attack the full-back and from there it's most difficult as the space is closed down and he normally has to pass it back or infield.

360~~~
Very encouraged by the progress Shaw appears to have made.  He genuinely looks like the prospect we signed from Southampton.
His decision to take a personal trainer on holiday with him has to be admired and he really appears to have taken seriously his efforts to get as fit as possible for the new season.
I think that has shown in all 3 games we have played now, and in particular last night where he looked really sharp and even ended up on the right wing crossing for Rooney's flick back which should really have resulted in goal of the season!  I'm happy now that Shaw has this position nailed down long term.

361~~~
That's because Memphis can do more than Young. He uses Shaw well enough, but more often than not, he uses him by not using him. Shaw is often the decoy run to open up space for him. At the end of the day, that's what you want to see. We expect Memphis to carry the fight down the left, not to constantly defer to the defender behind him.

362~~~
He played an absolutely terrible pass after which he had to get back in order to stop their counter. Credit to him for actually getting all the way over to the opposite side to launch a counter of our own though.

363~~~
Very good again. Defended well considering he got very little cover from Depay.

He does run really funny.

364~~~
Rapid leg movement.

365~~~
He is definitely more rapid than I expected him to be. Showing just why we splashed the cash on him, last season was just an anomaly.

366~~~
It's also that this was a more open game. When Memphis was at PSV their LB (Willems) was fantastic and productive going forward, so I don't think Shaw will have a problem when they get used to playing together and in games where Shaw can get forward because the other team is defending deep or narrow.

367~~~
That was my favourite thing about that move. Often the best attacking moments come when a player knows they've fecked up and their hackles are up.

Love the way he runs with the ball, perfect mix of pace, power and control.

368~~~
Starting to look like the real deal.

369~~~
Looking awfully fast. Think he lost about 5-7 kg from last year. Defended well. Good action most of the time.

370~~~
IF we keep De Gea our back five in this form with the addition of another class CB world probably the best in Europe defensively.

371~~~
Ironic that the best cross from our attacking right back was actually from Shaw when he stormed down the right side of the pitch.

Our attacking play from the right wing and fullback is dire.

372~~~
Except, y'know, all three of our goals. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Memphis runs in from the right, scores. Cuts inside from the right, shoots, scores. Crosses brilliantly from the right, Fellaini scores.

373~~~
Didnt he do all that from his left wing position?

374~~~
Except, y'know, they came from the left.

375~~~
Oh dear <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

his talent has never been a doubt. just need to stay healthy and fit, and he is right now. brilliant.

396~~~
He is going to be best in the world LB one day.

397~~~
His final ball neers to improve, otherwise great again. I feel so assured with him at the back.

398~~~
Still needs to sharpen up his anticipation when an attacking player comes at him with the ball. Darmian is much, much better at that.  Newcastle seemed to be able to shift the ball to either side of him a few times and get the ball into the box, where as very few balls come in from our right hand side. 

But in terms of recovering the ball at pace, winning it back and getting us moving forwards again, I think he's already one of the best in the league at that. Doesn't get done for pace, and always seems to manage to get a clean tackle in when it looks impossible.

399~~~
I really like Shaw, but his final ball is so frustrating. Is it me or does every one of his crosses into the box just hit the first defender?

400~~~
Both him and Darmian need to improve their final ball but I thought he as class again defensively, the LB equivalent of Smalling.

401~~~
I think our players just lack the crossing technique to bend the ball around and put it the keeper and defenders.

402~~~
Gunna be the best left back in the world sooner rather than later, defensively, ive not seen anything like it.

403~~~
He was brilliant.

404~~~
Same with Darmian. They both do everything else pretty much as you'd want them to, but the final ball needs work from both.

405~~~
it needs but still I think it's pretty okay, he always seem to put in a cross on purpose with his head up, he can see players arriving in the box for a cut back too.. very exciting player

406~~~
He is good defensively but there were points today I was questioning his price tag. He seems to struggle to really add anything to our attacking play he isn't great at all at beating his man and rarely gets to the by line with it.

Not trying to have a go at him just there were times today that made me miss Evra. When you consider what Evra cost us and what Shaw cost it's disappointing for me that he isn't a major improvement.

407~~~
Man of the match, in my opinion.

408~~~
Thank feck we never got Baines . Shaw has looked a class act so far , great pace and defensively solid .

409~~~
I'm not sure you were watching the same game I was.

410~~~
That's a very easy thing to work on. 

The fundamental basics of his game are fantastic though.

411~~~
He's a special footballer with potential that is just scary, especially for his age.

412~~~
Agreed. Defensively he's top notch and he's only getting better.

I probably say it too much but fecking hell how is he only 20?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

413~~~
The way he uses his body to keep the opponent from the ball is absolutely class. He's a top notch defender already. If he spends the season working on his general attacking play he'll be genuinely frightening.

414~~~
I'm being harsh but Evra used to add huge amounts of creativity and was always a player who could go past defenders and get to the byline. Shaw very rarely seems to do this. He gets played in a lot and will take the ball into the box but doesn't often seem to actually do much of note with it. I just expected for the price tag a little more going forward.

For me Darmian at £13 million looks the by far the better buy at the moment.

415~~~
He's fantastic, too bad his performance today will be forgotten due to us pissing away two points.

416~~~
He needs to improve on his crossing.

417~~~
Brilliant. I don't think I'd seen as good a teenage defender as Shaw at Southampton, among fullbacks at least. And now he's showing that week in week out with United.

If he could just develop his attacking game, he'll be one of the best.

418~~~
He's been in beast mode all season <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
My MOTM today.

419~~~
Was with everyone today. We were drilling them in which is always risky, the one time he floated it he found his man at the back post

420~~~
An incredible player in every sense. His crossing could improve but it's not like Evra was a good crosser either.

421~~~
it's incomparable. Evra was a bargain, that just happens as Veron or diMaria happen. When you want to buy the best English products with certain class you just pay a lot for it. We could scout and we do I believe a lot of players around the world and we could get another three players for around that prices we acquired Evra and hope he will come good but Shaw is definite success if he stays fit. That's what we bought. Still don't understand we people question those price tags. It's supply and demand and it all is influenced by so many factors.

Shaw is the second best defender in the team after Smalling, the only thing I would reproach him is his seemingly low level of presence. There are games when he doesn't really looks focused enough like he's out of his mind and reacts a bit late. But he will cut it out and become the best leftback in the world like Evra was, he will be different with his play style, t no worries he will come good in the end while is good enough even now.

422~~~
How does he looks a better buy? Darmian wasn't at his best today, Shaw is comfortably better player for me with much higher potential, five years younger and already better. Who cares about 15 millions. Was Young a better buy than Rooney? Rooney cost more and produced more, we paid top money for top player and potential, Darmian can come as a really good buy but it's all relative to say which buy is better. 

If Darmian was five years older and English from a good financed club, having played premier league from his 16years, his price would be much different and imagining he's 20, he still looks worse and with lower potential than Shaw now.. daft comparisons really but he looks likable as hell so I understand he's so popular here.

423~~~
Defended fairly well, and I thought he had a couple of nice attacking moments too, which has generally been the weaker part of his game so far.

424~~~
Not sure why you're completely ignoring his defensive play. At his peak he'll be a far better defender than Evra ever was and that should count equally as much as attacking play.

425~~~
100% agree.

426~~~
People have to find negatives.

427~~~
Don't be so ridiculous.  When you bought evra he was what....25? Luke shaw is 20 ffs - why would he be better yet? give him a chance and I'm sure he can add a lot more.

428~~~
It almost never really reaches our players, his ideas are good but the execution isnt great.

429~~~
Completely disagree, maybe he let in a few today but I don't think I've ever seen a defender as good at blocking crosses as Shaw.

430~~~
He was our best player today and imo has consistently put in good performances for us this season so far. His attacking play can still do with a bit improvement but hey the lad is 20, ample of time to still up his game. I have a good feeling that he will be the best left fullback in the league by the age of 23.

431~~~
I think he'll be the best left-back in the league a lot quicker than that. At 23 I expect him to be the best LB in the world.

432~~~
I think he is going to be the best left-back in the world, one day. Amazing how much potential he has, and how much quality he is already showing at this age. Imagine him in 7 or 8 years.

433~~~
Excellent player! 

Scary potential. Big fan since day one.

He's young, English and EPL proven, there was always going to be a "tax" on his price.

He's already very solid defensively, and his crossing is decent - there's always a target or a goal to his crosses, not blindly sending them in. He's also four years younger than what Patrice was when he joined us. So give him some time. He's only just turned 20.

435~~~
Like Darmian he has to work on his crossing (in the air or on the ground) but he's been a machine. Great footwork for his shot too. He tired near the end and got caught out twice due to that incl. the yellow and on their last counter (glad he didn't take a red but though eh could've put in an ealry tackle).

436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Where are them haters from pre-season?

437~~~
Waiting for the next youngster that doesn't look a world beater after 3 months. Shaw will be the best left back in the league for years and years to come.

438~~~
Really needs to improve his final ball/crossing. Getting to the byline with ease though which is nice to see.

439~~~
Probably waiting for him to get fat. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

440~~~
Now that Rafael has gone, Carrick coming to the twilight of his career. Shaw and Darmian are quickly becoming my favourite players.

441~~~
Because that would be looking at it positively and this is the CAF.

442~~~
Was it Jones who said in an interview that he thinks Shaw is the fastest player he's had to run against?  I've been stunned at how much ground he can cover.

443~~~
Hardly surprising at the moment given Darmian is 5 years older.

444~~~
I wouldn't expect him to become incredible as an attacker. I just don't think there's much of the attacking game that can be taught/developed to a great extent, at this age/stage. 
I think the full backs who tend to be brilliant offensively (especially dribbling) usually played as wingers/midfielders in the past. I can't think of many full backs who were <i>that </i>good offensively/had that bit of flair who didn't start off in different positions.

Baines is one, but it's his crossing and set pieces mostly.

But it's not a big deal anyway. His defending is already exceptional. I actually never expect him to get dribbled or turned.

445~~~
I really don't understand how anyone has doubted Shaw tbh.

He's looked fantastic pretty much everytime he's played for us. The only issue last season was his injuries.

446~~~
That seems to differ from different people, some say Valencia, other say Smalling.

447~~~
Oh I know buddy. Just go read page 1 of this thread.

448~~~
Yup. He didn't display his blistering pace that much last season, but he was as safe as they come defensively and I thought it was obvious he was going to be brilliant as soon as he would get a rest and return to full fitness.

449~~~
Loved that move when he played the one two and had a shot on goal. Would have been some goal for a fullback to score. 

It's quite incredible how complete he is given how young he is.

450~~~
He's going to be a beast. I think the rest of the world will recognise his talent soon enough, at which point the likes of Barca and Madrid will probably take an interest.

451~~~
With him being English and already at the biggest club in England, I'm not worried about that.

452~~~
Also the fact he found the move to Manchester hard enough I can't see him upping sticks and heading to Spain.

453~~~
He's still fairly young and inexperienced though, which is why a major move to a club like us would've probably been quite hard. Give him a few years here, and hopefully travelling across Europe for CL games, and the idea of going abroad won't be too strange for him.

Of course, hopefully it won't matter since he's the type of player who's crucial to hold on to.

454~~~
It's hard to believe that he only turned 20 this summer! He's really starting to show his class after an injury plagued first season. If he stays injury free, he will nail down a starting place for club and country. He looks absolute class.

455~~~
In terms of defending he's incredible for his age, for any age really. Couldn't be happier with that. People seem to forget how vulnerable we were down that side in Evra's last few years. It was a pretty big issue imo, and Shaw has solved it.

Going forward, he's growing in confidence and making some good runs beyond the opposition defence which is required to create space for Memphis. Shaw seems to have decent ball striking technique so I'm hoping he works on his crossing and adds a decent whipped cross to his game. We're a bit too predictable on the left now with Shaw reluctant to cross and Memphis always wanting to cut inside and shoot. Him and Memphis seem to have a decent understand already, so if they can continue developing that and add a bit more variation, the partnership could become something special.

456~~~
I think it would depend on the length of the sprint and what kind of start i.e a proper athletic track, from standing etc. Smalling covers a lot of ground in his typical defending situations of 1-10m spurts (where he's usually shielded or made a tackle by that point) and he's absolutely rapid there.

However, in a pure race it would have to be Valencia imo; he has the physique, lateral strength and endurance for a sprint anything more than 15m+. Sigh this made me think of Nani and would could have been.

With the ball (in game situation i.e dribbling with good control, not just kick and run) = Shaw?

457~~~
defensively he is fantastic for his young age, going forward he is good considering the pace he got but he needs to improve with his crossings or final deliveries.

same goes for darmian in this aspect. both seems to be a bit slow with their act once they enter the final third of the opponents half.

458~~~
His final delivery is pi** poor IMO.. He is dreadful with crosses.
Even on the ground, most of the time he can't pick a pass quick enough and loses the ball or passes to opponent..

I am hoping to see him improve vastly on the final delivery by end of season.

459~~~
It is definitely a directive. I don't think you can hold it against him that you could expect more attacking from him. Van Gaal pretty clearly favours the fullback to pick their moment to go forward and join the attack. Right now the front three are unbalanced and thus they don't want to bomb on and leave the flanks open. 

Van Gaal would have dropped Evra in an instant. (Of course if he wasn't captain etc etc.) Patrice had an attacking mind of his own and would sometimes just get the ball and run all the way up the pitch just to get something started. There is no way he'd have survived under LVG.

460~~~
This guy is going to be fantastic

461~~~
He gets caught inside or too high at times but his recovery pace is great.

462~~~
An absolute star in the making.

463~~~
I just hope his injury problems are behind him.

464~~~
I thought we'd decided he was rubbish, over priced and fat before the season started? 

Hard to keep up on here at times.

465~~~
People will look back on his transfer fee and say what a bargain.

466~~~
Absolute beast of a player.

467~~~
I love as soon as they play that lofted pass over Depay to to the right back Shaw is charging him down, he's won so many balls like that.

468~~~
It helps to be fast.

469~~~
We have two tanks on the left hand side.

470~~~
England and United can be calm, they have a left back for the next 10 years.

471~~~
What a player we have on our hands. Only needs to keep himself fit and he could be England and United's left back for the next 10-15 years.

472~~~
Our best player so far, IMO. Can't wait to see how dominant he becomes when he adds some real creativity to his game. With his technique it'd be a tremendous shame if he didn't add that extra dimension.

473~~~
got my MOTM, even Rooney would win it normally with hattrick on points but I was impressed by Shaw's performance again, wonderful player.

That left hand side <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

474~~~
He's good. He's so good. He's so fecking good.

475~~~
And mine. Rooney did great but two of them were tap ins. Shaw was superb, relentless, quick, used the ball well, completely dominated. Fantastic to see and great credit to him that he is in this shape.

476~~~
Pure garbage. Evra was a beast for us and probably our greatest leftback ever, even over Irwin. He was so good in his peak that the caf were labelling him a God or something. Shaw still has a long way to go before he can reach Evra's level.

That being said, both of them are shite at delivering crosses. However, Evra was our main attacking outlet on the left because his dribbling and ball control was world class. We haven't seen any of that from Shaw.

477~~~
He's so assuring, and getting better offensively too, massive massive talent and class.

478~~~
He's been one of, if not our best player so far this season. The guy is just brilliant, plain and simple.

479~~~
Fantastic talent. We're really starting to see what we signed. Hope it continues.

480~~~
How on earth is he only 20? Built like a tank and doesn't really have any of the weaknesses you expect a young fullback to have.

481~~~
Best player so far this season. He is an absolute tank.

482~~~
His 20th birthday was last month....

The potential is outrageous here. Finally seeing what we were waiting for, and boy was it worth it.

483~~~
What I loved to see he was in the attack so often, drifted inwards a lot, near their box, and was active all game.

484~~~
In terms of being complete in his role, is he currently our best player?

485~~~
I'm so fecking pleased that everyone is seeing what this lad is capable of now <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

486~~~
Narrowly behind Smalling as our best player these first 5 games. Darmian narrowly behind Luke.

487~~~
Only just turned 20 too. Madness.

488~~~
Very happy we "overpaid" for this lovable player (unlike with Hazard when we refused to pay over the odds).
Sky is the limit for him, already top class when in form I dare to say

489~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPKiGA8LRjE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Possibly my favourite moment of the game. Cuts off a counter attack with a great interception, races forward to support his winger and then after the cross is cleared he races back at lightning speed to steal the ball and start it all over again...when we're 6-1 up. Gotta love that.

490~~~

491~~~
Fantastic clip. Not even going at full speed either.

492~~~
I know the "Beast Mode" gimmick is Smalling's but Shaw is right there with him, he just devours the ground in front of him when he drives with the ball.

493~~~
We suddenly have two of the best fullbacks in the league. How cool is that?  In the words of LvG, "it's the year of Luke Shaw" indeed.

494~~~
His improvement from last season has been astronomical. Not that he was awful by any means last season, but this season he looks a completely different player. He's physically dominant, attacks with purpose, and hardly ever seems to get beaten defensively. 

I think a lot of it probably comes down to feeling more comfortable off the pitch in Manchester. It's sometimes overlooked how difficult it can be, particularly for young players, to up-sticks and move to a different city. He's also looking physically fitter than last year, which is undoubtedly playing its part in his impressive performances...

495~~~
He's a fecking monster, such an immense player. How the hell is he only 20 years old?

Easily my favorite player in the team.

496~~~
He was a beast last night. We're finally starting to see why the club forked out 30 odd million for a then 18 year old. Immense talent.

497~~~
Arguably the best United player on the pitch in every game so far this season. Which is absolutely ridiculous for a left back who's barely out of his teens. His strength and pace are the most obvious assets but he's got unbelievable balance too. Just an amazing athlete.

498~~~
When's he's allowed to break and run at pace he's breathtaking to watch.

499~~~
Yeah and he can develop a lot physically once he sheds the baby fat and adds some considerable muscle.

500~~~
I keep hearing the fat jokes but I don't see no fat on him.

501~~~
People are equating stocky with fat I think

502~~~
There was baulking at the price we paid but I never saw it as a risk. Even last year when he had fitness and injury niggles you could tell he was going to be important for us.

503~~~
You could say that for Darmian and Smalling as well though. Even Blind. Our back 4 has been impeccable this season.

504~~~
Glad he's ours.

505~~~
Agreed, one of few, if not the only shining light so far this season.

506~~~
Definitely not "only".

507~~~
He has a massive arse, but that's really it.

508~~~
wondering if the guys who think that Shaw is fat also think Depay is fat fecker..

509~~~
Don't get 'em started on Valencia...

510~~~
People are actually fecking stupid.

511~~~
Opposition fans only started with this after LVG said something about him not being fit..of course, they will run with this for the next decade..they are stupid, ignore them..

512~~~
It doesn't bother me that much, just trying to understand the origin of some jokes. Just like Lampard used to be called fat when he was one of the best CMs in England.

513~~~
Yes, it originated from those LVG comments..such is the originality of some people

514~~~
Outstanding......Delighted for him.

515~~~
Don't try and blame it on opposition fans, there were loads on here who spouted the same bollocks. No surprise there though.

516~~~
This. Some stupid stuff was said about his ability as well.

517~~~
He was pure class vs Chelsea at the bridge last season. He's looked pretty much at that level all of this season so far. Long may it continue.

518~~~
Dare I say, he is the player doing his job the best in our squad.

519~~~
If he can add in some quality in the final 3rd he'll be best LB in the world.

520~~~
I lost count how many times I defended him on the caf last season. Utterly bizarre.

521~~~
Plenty of times people clamoured for Blind or Rojo to be at LB ahead of him. Crazily, just based on pre-season I remember some guys suggesting Reece James should be ahead of him at one point.

522~~~
Just madness, even he's fee was brought up loads. The same player who just made TOTY at the age of 18 with a top 7-8 team <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

523~~~
Memphis has a well defined upper body, that helps.

524~~~
It was mad, but not unusually so for the caf. People on here are just weird, desperate to be pessimistic about our players against all logic and common sense.

525~~~
Best player again which tells you all you need to know about this match so far

He's going to be amazing in a season or two

526~~~
He is unbelievable.

527~~~
Fantastic showing again. Hard to believe he is only 20 years old.

528~~~
Excellent signing. He was woeful against Spurs but after that he's back to his usual best. Keep him fit and we will have our LB sorted for at least 5 years.

529~~~
Him and Smalling leading our POTY at the moment by a considerable distance I imagine.

530~~~
Best player on the pitch today. If he stays at this club for a long time and develops properly, he could become the best LB we ever had at the club. Even better than Evra or Irwin, he's really young but already very good.

531~~~
One of the biggest positives of this season. Such a brilliant player.

532~~~
Smalling's errors today put Shaw a step ahead now.

533~~~
Shaw was at fault for the 2nd goal according to some in the match day thread..

534~~~
Him leaving space behind when he gets forward is to be expected but he needs to chose his moments wisely. He shouldn't be caught out so high up the pitch when we are 1-0 up.

535~~~
I think he is doing very well this season, but it is true that he isn't making his choices on when to go forward and when to stay back very wisely.  To be fair, the one where he was out of position for the first goal was entirely down to Rooney giving the ball away when he never, ever should've.

536~~~
We're struggling to create chances, our right back is quite conservative already, and some people are saying Shaw <i>attacks too much</i>? Christ.

537~~~
Easily our MOTM, he was excellent.

538~~~
He had a good game, his error for the second goal was that he was pushing on to try and get us back in front and forgot that he needs to keep closer to Blind to cover for his lack of speed and that gap let Gomis get in, which was sloppy since we saw that was a weak spot in the first half.

539~~~
Absolutely the MotM. He's been one of few shining lights this season as well as fellow defenders Darmian and Smalling. 

He was maybe too far forward for the first goal but it's not his fault Rooney is giving the ball away when we've commited so many bodies forward.

540~~~
Totally agree, you can't blame Shaw for not expecting Rooney to lose the ball that simple (maybe he should though with the current state/form Rooney is in nowadays)... if Shaw stays back in attacking situation like that he would just stay on the edge of our own box for 90 minutes.

541~~~
He is briliant, probably our best player this season.

542~~~
Excellent again today, more-so because he had a non-existant Memphis in front of him. Brilliant ball for Mata, too. I like how he takes responsibility and never shies away from the ball. The drive he provides is great to see. If every other player were on his level this season, we'd be top of the league. So far, only Smalling has been on par with him.

543~~~
The youngest player in the first 11 and by far the best.

544~~~
One of the few exciting things about United atm.

He's just brilliant, every single time.

545~~~
Easily indeed.

546~~~
Our best player atm. By far.

547~~~
Hopefully he stays injury free, because I think he will be our LB for the next 10 years. And to think hes only 20. Fun watching him pick up the ball and run down the side, glad he got his assist.

548~~~
Im literally having an argument with a guy on another website right now who is telling me that Shaw (and Darmian) have been shit this season and Shaw can't defend and wants to know what he even brings to the team.

I honestly don't get how people can be so dumb.

549~~~
Looking well on course for this summer prediction. I thought Smalling would be a contender as well but I worried Van Gaal would be stupid enough to play Jones in front of him (probably would've been if he hadn't got injured).

550~~~
Man of Match performance tonight IMO. The lad is already proving to be a great acquisition by the club.

551~~~
He's competing with Kolarov for best left back in the league so far this season. Fair play to him. Long may it continue!

552~~~
He's our best outfield player. Love him.

553~~~
That fee is going to be chump change just like it was for Rooney and Rio. He's got so many years to go before he's even in his prime.

554~~~
Thank god we did not get Baines the summer before last because we might have missed out on this talent. Maurauding fullbacks are several underrated in their attacking contributing in my own opinion.

555~~~
His attacking game has come along leaps and bounds from last season and that was a thumping finish by Kane too by the way.

556~~~
God.

557~~~
I think he'll be one where in 10 years we'll say it was money very well spent. He has all the tools to become a United legend.

558~~~
Understatement.

559~~~
Very good.

560~~~
He's playing with so much confidence right now, great to see.

561~~~
Let's not forget he's 20, TWENTY. It'll be another 6/7 years before he hits his peak.

562~~~
Neville was right when he said:

“I think Luke will need time to settle in, as any 19-year-old boy would coming to Manchester. I am expecting he will do well this season but you will really see a really quite fantastic full-back in 18 months to two years.

Almost perfect from Neville, but Shaw is 6 months ahead on schedule!

563~~~
He's excellent, hard to believe he's so young.

564~~~
GOAT

565~~~
So good to see him and Smalling bossing it, they're both fecking excellent players.

566~~~
I had a gander at some of the comments after we first bid for him and I'd actually forgotten how negative the caf was overall. A lot of comments about us being silly for choosing him over the far superior Coentrao or how it was a ludicrous amount of money and a ridiculous gamble. Not too dissimilar to the Martial thread last week actually which is reassuring.

He looked a star from the moment he set foot in the PL, really. I managed to catch his England debut live and he looked completely at home then too. You could just tell with that kind of composure as a teenager he'd have to screw things up massively not to deliver on that kind of potential.

567~~~
Another great performance from Shaw.  Three out of our back 4 is set for the next 5 years.  As for England, Shaw and Sterling forming a nice partnership terrorizing the left flank with their pace is bad news for England opponents.

568~~~
Like I said not long ago, the world will be talking about Shaw soon, with the likes of Madrid and Barca sniffing around him.

I bet he's be one of the hardest fullbacks to play against, unbelievable pace and strong as an ox. You're not getting past him.

569~~~
He's got the potential to be England's goat left back. Has it in him to be better than Cole.

570~~~
Yep agree! It's a shame we could keep Pogba and DDG as we'd be embarrassed in top Young prospects!

571~~~
The Form he's showing right now is 30m pound form. I cant think of a fullback anywhere playing better right now. He's a defensive juggernaut, whose absolutely rapid and confident enough to charge forward, completely bypassing oppositions midfield and single-handedly starting attacks.

572~~~
It is simply remarkable that he only just turned 20.

573~~~
I still think we need to look after him. Give him as much rest as when we can i.e do not play him in the league cup games. He combines great technique with great athleticism and he's shown that almost every game (that's pretty intense). He's only a young adult and still growing/filling out etc, please don't run him into the ground!

574~~~
I had for the fortune of being at the match today... He was fantastic. All three of our United players were, in fact.

575~~~
Shaw sure is developing quite nicely isn't he? A lot of his apparent problems last season could be chalked down to some injury issues, and the transfer from Southampton to United. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/man-uniteds-luke-shaw-admits-admits-he-always-gets-nervous-before-games/326514" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/man-uni...ts-he-always-gets-nervous-before-games/326514</a>

Makes a lot of sense in hindsight. Transitioning to the weight of expectations at United is no mean feat, especially for a kid. Seemed quite circumspect through the initial months, more focused on getting the minor details right under Van Gaal, and concentrating more on the defensive aspect of his position. But now he seems to have found his groove, reflected in the amount of confidence he displays on the pitch, especially going forward. One of the biggest positives of the season thus far. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

576~~~
I'm so glad we got him over Chelsea and I'm so glad that Moyes failed in his bid to get Baines. The fee was steep but it was always obvious that he'd be worth it.

577~~~
Will be England's 1st choice LB for the next 10 years.

Incredible player. Massive improvement from last season. Still not in his prime as well. Just imagine him in his prime <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

578~~~
30 mil for this guys and is already worth it. 

The same people who get their panties wet over the money for martial might just change their mind like they did with shaw.

On another note; what a job Southampton and everton have done for the english national team.

579~~~
Prime example of why I don't give a shit how much money the club spend on a player they want as long as Woodward isn't running up unsustainable debt in doing so, which I'm certain he isn't because his magic with money and finances is how he got appointed to his current role by the Glazers.

I still remember the final game of 13/14 away at Southampton when he was matched up against Januzaj and never once looked like he would be beaten by him.  In fact while he's been tremendous this season for United and barring anything unforeseen seems to be likely to be well worth his transfer fee and then some, anybody that watched him a few times in his first 2 seasons in the PL with Southampton knew that he was a top quality, surefire prospect.

580~~~
So despite what many have said here in the caf, LVG does know how to man-manage his players.

581~~~
irwin, evra and now shaw. by this rate he will end up being up there along irwin and paddy as our best LBs over the premiership era.

582~~~
I haven't seen the game yet but would love it if someone would post his highlights from the England game. Heard he had a phenomenal game. So glad he has proved all his doubters wrong. Like I have been telling in the past two, he has been very careful with how he has developed for us. Last season it was all about defending and he got that aspect fine-tuned. This season he is a marauding beast with his runs and pace. If he can sustain this and stay fit, the fee we paid for him will seem nothing. Hope he can cause havoc week in week out for us.

583~~~
Every time the camera is on him I expect him to be gasping for air. He's a fecking beast.

Probably because players at these clubs get to play every week.

584~~~
I don't know. Shaw was further along in his development than Martial when we bought them.

585~~~
The people writing Shaw off when we bought him had clearly never actually watched him play for Southampton, or had and are just clueless idiots who know nothing about football. All they could ever mention bad about him is that the price was too much for an 18 year old LB. The big difference between Shaw and Martial and pretty much all 18/19 year old players is he wasn't just potential, he was already a great player. He had already made the PL team of the year, had two strong seasons and was already one of the best players in the league in his position. He can never improve and he'll still be a fantastic player. A player at his age with his ability is a no brainer for 30m.

586~~~
Going to praise him with one hand - very good, especially going forward but from the other hand - have to say again noticed the same as in most games this season - he makes some mental errors that hopefully he'll iron out sooner than later on the defensive side of his game. Today, he went off chasing after a player today into the middle when he lost the ball and had runners run behind him. Just uneasy at times when he lets runners get in behind him or he gets caught out of position.

For a 20 year old though, he's damned good and as long as he stays fit, can only see him getting better and better with more games.

587~~~
See I disagree here, when he makes those attacking runs it's up to one if the three central midfielders to identify the space and fill it themselves.

588~~~
Yeah, people keep bleating on about our fullbacks being too defensive and needing to get forward but when Shaw gets forward people claim he's out of position.

589~~~
You don't need to when he gets caught out of position so often.

590~~~
Just as well he doesn't then. Obviously I'm aware that once or twice can lead to a gross exaggeration amongst the more peculiar posters on RedCafe.

Luke Shaw is the most assured teenage (I'm aware he's just turned 20) defender I've ever seen in the Premier League. The most obvious 'sure thing' young defender you will ever encounter in football.

591~~~
He's going to be absolutely top class. Hard to believe how young he is.

592~~~
I'm 50/50 on that tbh, that is why lvg loves working with youth, they buy into his ideals fully and haven't discovered an ego yet.

593~~~
Good to see he has kept his form up. Is fast becoming one of my favourite players.

594~~~
No doubting he's going to be brilliant but his positional play in quite poor at present. Both Swansea goals came from a gaping hole he'd left behind him.

I'm pleased he is attacking and want to see Uniteds full backs get forward, but Shaw needs to learn when to make those runs. He also comes quite narrow a lot and occasionally chases the ball rather than holding shape.

595~~~
*LvG voice* Can you believe it?

596~~~
Just not true. Yeah he was out of position because we got smashed on the counter after just launching our own counter attack for the second. He can't see the future, he didn't know Rooney would piss possession away

597~~~
The amount of times I had to write a post exactly like this defending Shaw before purchase, shortly after purchase and during his injuries was annoying. I've been saying it since we signed him, £30m was an absolute bargain and got slated for it. 

Now onto a better piece of business.. give the fecker a new 5 year contract!

598~~~
The funniest was some guy claiming we should have bought Ben Davies instead...

599~~~
The season of Luke Shaw

600~~~
Not convinced football works like this.

For a start, our captain would be at his hypothetical peak right now.

601~~~
Oh it's not a given, but generally it's the case.

602~~~
Absolutely. However, although it is very likely that Shaw will continue to improve significantly he doesn't <i>need </i>to. If he were to just maintain his current level for the next 10 years then he will go down as a fantastic servant for the club.

603~~~
100% agree. That goal was 100% Rooney his fault. No way anybody would expect Rooney (who is considered one of our best players) to give the ball away that simple.

604~~~
I'm glad you're one of those people who can't see a players limitations.

Unless its Rooney.

605~~~
I do see limitations, I don't blame full backs for being in attacking positions when the team is attacking

606~~~
especially a formation where the fullbacks start high up the pitch and are meant to get forward.

607~~~
What does this stands for? I see it a lot but can't make it out.

608~~~
Greatest of all time?

609~~~
Greatest of all time.

610~~~
Football does work like that, he not improve in terms of ability but at that age his experience will do the talking. Our captain is coming to the end of the peak period and he had shown bags of experience.

611~~~
Ah, thanks

612~~~
More often than not, I suppose. But I also think that once he turns 28, people will just start referring to his 'experience' because it will be logical to do so, and imply that he's just become mature of late. His game at the moment is not that of an immature defender for me.

Ryan Giggs was carelessly ceding possession with silly and unecessary backheels well into his late 30s - acts which would be categorised as him showing his 'inexperience' if he were 21.

Just me, and probably an argument for another thread - but I think experience is often overstated. I think more than anything, there is a physical maturity or experience that comes with age, and then becoming an older man may help you deel with pressure and the like. But, while I know that pro football is tough, I think the fact that even a 19 year old footballer has been playing football all of his life is often overlooked. The implication is that he just started kicking a ball last week on his debut. While he may not be able to physically cope, or mentally with the occasion - from a football perspective, I don't necessarily think this is the case.

Personally, I think I always had good decision making on the pitch from a youngster, and I played at a very good level.  In front of goal, for instance, just from lots of practise and watching top finishers - I'd naturally pick my spot, or try and put it through the keepers legs if possible, or give the keeper the eyes etc. However, they would say that a Danny Welbeck will 'learn that once he's older'. Yea, he may have been playing at youth level before, but I don't see why he cannot be composed in front of goal as a young player.

Bit of a detour, I know. Perhaps I'll make a thread and discuss.

613~~~
Not relly, he's outside the norm. The hypothetical peak you speak of is based on an average and the average is that players start playing proper first team football at around 19-21, sometimes even later. Rooney started at 16. He's probably past his physical peak which means he's probably past his best.

614~~~
And Shaw has been playing from a similarly young age, which is partly why I made the point in the first place.

615~~~
He really is an excellent player. If he's anything like Cole was for Chelsea in terms of longevity, peak performances and consistency we have made an absolute coup.

It's the year of Luke Shaw, fellas.

616~~~
Then his peak is probably 6-7 years away. However Rooney isn't known for taking care of himself as carefully as many other athletes. With him much of his strength and stamina is natural. It's a matter of years how at the top how well you take care of yourself.

617~~~
I hope so, but I've heard reliable reports from The Caf that he lacks pace <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

618~~~
He has been immense this season, our best player so far IMO. I was a little critical of him earlier in the season because despite being immaculate defensively I felt he was being wasteful going forward. 3 assists in his last 3 for club/country so he seems to be addressing that.

619~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

620~~~
I think that Hoddle highlighted one of his great strengths the other night too, he is so quick on the turn that it give him great recovering capabilities.

621~~~

622~~~
I find it hard to believe that Luke Shaw, a LB seems to have more 'freedom' to do things with a ball than a Wayne Rooney. Shaw attacks at will. carries the ball a lot and takes chances. So LVG gives him special privileges? or maybe he is just good and playing well?

623~~~
Probably because of our defense minded midfield offers protection for full backs to wander OR Shaw is so fast it doesn't matter if he loses the ball, he'll make it back even with a 20 yard disadvantage <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

624~~~
Rooney plays all the way at the top, he should be even less worried about losing the ball then shouldnt he?

625~~~
Love that England's best three players against Switzerland were the United men, Smalling, Shaw and Rooney. Been a while since we've been able to say that (although to be fair Welbeck's always been excellent under Hodgson, and Carrick would've been a consistent top performer for England if he actually played with any regularity.)

626~~~

627~~~
He's awesome. United has that LB-position sorted out for the coming 10 years at the least.

628~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I know the season's not got off to the best start, but I'm still so pleased with so many of our players, Shaw and Smalling foremost amongst them.

629~~~
Quite good....again.

630~~~
Is he our best outfield player? He's definitely up there.

631~~~
Him or Smalling, definitely. Says a boatload about our attackers.

632~~~
Get the impression that him and Darmian will form the best fullback pairing we've had in a while. Shaw's attacking game has been superb this season, after being a little rusty in the last. Darmian needs some work on his delivery, as was the case in Torino, but he'll find his groove soon enough. Genuinely excited by the prospects of our defense between these two, and Smalling.

633~~~
Could probably cover the left side of the pitch by himself.

634~~~
Beast! Fantastic player, owned Milner with that tackle.

635~~~
I love Smalling but Shaw's ability with the ball gives him the edge imo.

636~~~
Only player giving it a go. Bless him.

637~~~
This team will ruin him.

He's a lightning quick full back who is capable of beating players with pace and dribbling but when he gets into dangerous areas or looking to create something, he's presented with slow, ponderous shit in front of him.

He'll be infected soon.

638~~~
Please stay fit. He was bloody brilliant again. He has a shout of having been MOTM in almost every game this season.

639~~~
Love him.

640~~~
Was just saying this as well. His signing is reminiscent of Rio, we paid a lot but it has settled one of the spots in our team for 10-15 years.

641~~~
He picks up pace and goes forward which is so important to our generally static and slow game

642~~~
Monstrously good today.. for me him and BFS motm by a country mile but Shaw was consistently majestic over 90 minutes

643~~~
He's a beast and only 19/20. Wow just stay fit.

644~~~
Solid.  Honestly think Depay's struggles the last couple of games curtail his effectiveness attacking.  Him and Young linked very well in the 2nd half.

645~~~
no matter how young he is he's best leftback in the league already, next Untied legend

646~~~
Yeah he was showing signs of frustration with Memphis when he'd bomb forward and not get the return ball when Memphis passed backwards.

647~~~
Literally the only player in the first half who didn't look like a complete mong while attacking.

648~~~
I saw the same. Memphis seemed unsure of what to do today and hesitant to cross it in with his left when Clyne was showing him to the byline.  I'm confident he'll get it sorted and him and Shaw will form a dangerous partnership.

649~~~
He was amazing. A tank of a LB and once he starts you can't catch him. Defensively magnificent. Hope he carries on

650~~~
can see why we forked out all that money. simply quality.

651~~~
Our biggest talent since Ronaldo! I know it is impossible for him to reach the heights of Ronaldo since Shaw is a defender and they will never be as highly thought of as attackers but I have not been this sure that we are watching a future world class player since Ronaldos early days.

652~~~
He's a tank. As long as he stays fit, he's going to be a regular for the next decade.

653~~~
I'm not sure who coined the phrase but he is the proverbial Tank with a Ferrari engine, our best attacker in the first half as well.

654~~~
Brilliant game from him. Oozes class atm and also looks very confident.

655~~~
Solid as ever, whats new?

656~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just remember some people thought he was a waste of money last season. Numpties will never learn

657~~~
I´m becoming a groupie. He´s fantastic.

658~~~
Incredible.

Someone said he could cover the entire left side by himself and it's true. What a player and he'll only get better. I think he's already the best left back in the league.

659~~~
It's a shame; i can imagine him putting this types of performances for years non stop and still be overlooked for things like the balon d'or; because defenders hardly win it.   This guys has the ability to be the best LB ever IMO.  He's already in a hand full of games made me feel like he's better than evra even at an older age.

660~~~
It does sound silly but if you think about it, erm maybe it could happen.

661~~~
Absolute animal of a player. 

20 years old? Feck me.

662~~~
It's just i cant remember a fullback at his age being so composed. 

Especially after roberto carlos; fullbacks started becoming judged on their attacking ability but shaw's defensive abilities are as good or even better than his attacking.

663~~~
Running out of superlatives. He's a machine. Reads the game amazingly well.

664~~~
He's an absolute machine, defensively so secure the only time a player gets behind him is when he's made a lung bursting run forward: he was our best player in the first half and the only person driving the team forward, I absolutely love him.

665~~~
I remember some brilliant performances by him at SFC before he came to us. He was terrific today. Creative, with vision, the beating of his man all day. He was so good not too many people noticed. Brilliant young player and an excellent signing among a whole raft of excellent signings.

666~~~
Love the bite in his tackling. Fantastic full back.

667~~~
Remember the 'Shaw+Herrera < Can+Moreno'?

668~~~
very bright future ahead of him.  If he stays fit, can play 100s of games for us.

669~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed. You could see him stretching our his arms to Memphis - must be annoying to go on a brilliant run, just to see the winger pass it to a midfielder instead.

670~~~
He's really stepped it up this year already,  was excellent today I thought and looked most likely to make anything happen in the 1st half.

671~~~
Superb start to the season and has a huge opportunity now for club and country.

672~~~
Could comfortably be our starting LB for 10+ years.

673~~~
It's hard not to get excited about this guy's future here, isn't it?

It was amazing today, when you saw him get the ball near the halfway line, that sudden burst of pace came out of nowhere and the Liverpool players weren't sure how to react when he would do it through the middle.

Up there as one of my favourite players, the potential is outrageous right now.

674~~~

675~~~
Hard work has paid off for him.

676~~~
His talent was obvious, even last year. Now he shows it with frightening consistency and without injuries.

677~~~
Future Maldini. 

Incredibly talented player, he is a pleasure to watch.

678~~~
I thought he was good last year too whenever he played, fatigue which probably resulted in alot of the injuries just ended up ruining his season a bit.
Now he didn't play for the U21's and it was the best decision for him and the team, he looks great and what a player we have here.

679~~~
Man of the match for me today.  I keep forgetting how young he is, right in the age bracket of Memphis, Martial, Januzaj and Perreira.  We have nice young crop of talent.

680~~~
Knock on wood with injuries and such, but he looks set to join De Gea as our other world class footballer out there. I guess Schweinsteiger might qualify if he can stay fit, too.

681~~~
Bargain!

682~~~
He doesn't do anything revolutionary but what he does do he does extremely well, once he gets going he's the Juggernaut, pretty much impossible to stop.

683~~~
Luke Shaw is nearly 6'1" according to Tyler today and various other sources. 

Mind blown. 

I had him down as 5'9"ish due to his stocky shape. He must have a bigger arse than Ivanovic to be that shape and that tall.

684~~~
Comfortably the best LB in the league. He's just brilliant.

685~~~
I agree. One of the best teenage defenders I've ever seen.

686~~~
I mean...I had to throw several superlatives out the window during this game.

The kid is just sheer class. He can own the left side of any game if he chooses.

687~~~
Without a shadow of a doubt.

688~~~
He played very well. Obviously LVG had a word in his ear after Swansea because this time he was often seen sprinting back into position after his attacking forays.

689~~~
The most talented player in our squad? He's incredible.

There's a few on here who love to shit on British talent for a lack of technique/ability, but his technique looks far superior to Memphis' despite all the 'Neanderthal british coaching'.

690~~~
Van Gaal will sort the english players out.  Its easy to forget that spain were an international team playing below their strengths much like England have been doing.  Then comes a manager who archetypes xavi & iniesta and re-embraces possesion football helping spain becoming a dominant force.

We can all hope for some of the same at england at least. 

Shaw, smalling, Jones,  Wilson and all the other blokes van gaal might train and adapt can only help us.

I hope.

691~~~
Agree with this. Tactical evolution usually comes from the clubs. It is more than likely LvG's training methods might help England in the long run but for that to happen we probably need to sign Harry Kane as well. Right now we have a good CB and LB for England. None of our top prospects bar Wilson are English either.

692~~~
I love how he stood his ground and not let anyone go pass him.

693~~~
Not only he is fast, he is also strong and can stand up to a challenge and keep the ball very well. Continues to grow each game and putting some amazing performances. Hoping and praying he can stay injury free!!

694~~~
Been our best attacking player this year for me, which says a lot. He looks very tidy on the ball and linking well with Memphis, Young and the CMs.

His trademark has to be the marauding runs though, he just moves in the space afforded by other players being marked tightly and explodes into it.

Delighted because I think he's immensely likeable and will be a stunningly good LB for the next decade.

695~~~
He and Darmian just never cease to amaze me. Finally, United back to have players that become the envy of other teams in the world.

696~~~
I'd be shocked if he was that tall. Really doesn't look like it. Maybe because it's he's rather wide/stocky as you mentioned that gives the illusion that he isn't as tall as he looks.

697~~~
Nothing to report really, he's consistently putting in these type of performances. Best fullbacks in the league.

698~~~
He's so influential.. Been in beastmode since the end of last season. He's simply refusing to let games pass him by and I love him for it.

699~~~
Wouldn't swap our full backs for anyone in the league. 

Was saying to mate yesterday that his improvement is at a rate I've rarely seen. Every game he seems to grow in stature. There was a moment yesterday where he chased a Liverpool player (Firmino possibly) all the way to within 30 yards of their own goal and he was so aggressive in closing him down - he literally was all ver him. Was quite funny but impressive.

700~~~
He's exactly the sort of fullback wingers will loathe coming up against. Strong, tenacious, quick as feck, and persistent. He doesn't give a minutes rest or space to anyone and to make matters worse, if he's just tracked your 60 yard run down the flank and managed to get the ball, you'd better be prepared to turn on your heels and make an even quicker 60 yard dash in the opposite direction because he's going to eat up that space you just left in no time. 

Here's to the next decade!

701~~~
A bargain at those £30m. Half of our signings from last season are really proving to be very valuable players (Shaw, Herrera, Blind).

702~~~
Not to forget when he out-headed benteke =o

703~~~
His first touch is ridiculous there was a moment when the ball was switched and clearly going out of play and he does a miraculous first touch over his head and still keeps it in. 

Beast of a player and he is going to be our Maldini at this rate.

704~~~
shaw and darmian. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

705~~~
Some comments from his first season... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

706~~~
That was fecking perfect. Had goal written all over it but Luke thought otherwise.

707~~~
Just before Shaw signed for us my mate had a photo with him while out shopping, he is the same height as me 6ft, and Shaw was basically indentical perhaps a little taller. 

I think his floppy hair and stocky build makes him look smaller as you say, and not forgetting a lot of pro's are actually pretty tall.

708~~~
Shaw's aspirations should be to match the great LB's the game has seen. He's England's next great LB after Ashley Cole and barring injury, should be impossible to usurp for club or country over the next decade unless a prodigy pops up who currently isn't even a pro.

I hope we can get him to improve his end product because all those runs and penetrative force should bring with it a fear factor that opens up the final third for our attackers. Hopefully it comes with time because he would be something else with either Irwin's crossing and shooting or Evra's short-passing, 1-2's and dribbling. Even a lesser combination of both in the final third would be good enough.

Outside of the final third, he's already the best left-back in the league, and I guess purists that want defenders to be defenders first and foremost are already content with what he offers, but his ability and potential are so high that I feel the coaching staff, and ourselves as fans, should want to see him shoot for the sky and not have his name look out of place when compared to the greatest LB's the game has seen when his career is over.

It's too early to say the same of Martial, but I think Shaw is the once in a generation LB, just as Cole was before him. It's patently obvious why we spent what we did on him, and to think there's potentially a lot more to come, and that fee could become a bargain.

I haven't read through this thread, but there has probably already been talk of us now having a left-sided triumvirate with the makings of Arsenal's best in Cole, Pires and Henry. I hope Depay turns out to be as good as some people think, and obviously, it's way too earlier to tell with Martial, but it will be interesting to watch these three kids grow and develop in unison with us from now on. Shaw can certainly uphold his end of the bargain and I hope the others can as well.

Imagine the havoc of a Shaw-Giggs or Shaw-Ronaldo left flank, which Irwin and Evra were blessed with for the majority of their careers, and this lad deserves a talent of similar vein in front of him. Let's hope Depay turns out to be that guy.

Last thought about Shaw is with regards to the Champions League. It will be interesting to see if he is as dominant there as he is in the Premier League. Experiencing new styles of play and systems looking to find tactical and intelligence flaws in his game will elevate him even further for us, but in the meantime, it will be fascinating to see how he copes with it all.

I missed it.. did it look as bad as Owen says?

712~~~
Bollocks. feck. feck off.

713~~~
feckfeckfeckfeckfeckfeckfeckfeck.

It flopped as soon as the tackled went through, this is a 5/6 months job, I bet you. That is so unlucky for the guy.

714~~~
Distraught for the lad. Hope it's not as serious as it looks.

715~~~
Looks like a snapped leg. Absolutely gutted for him.

716~~~
feck it. By the look of that challenge a clean break is probably a good outcome. 

His knee twisted horribly.

717~~~
Looks like a broken ankle... It was going so well too <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Yeah. Clear break.

720~~~
WHY GOD WHY

feck

Gutted feck sake

Looks bad. Taking oxygen.

We're gonna miss the slow bastard.

Feck.

727~~~
That's our great back four broken up then.

728~~~
Definitely a broken leg, saw it move in the other direction as he fell down.

Such a fecking shame, he was finally looking brilliant and that happens.

729~~~
bULLSHIT feck off

730~~~
Well, we'll see him next year then!

731~~~
Ffs, last player we needed getting that sort of injury, gutted for him.

732~~~
Jesus Christ that's horrific, absolutely snapped.

733~~~
Thats him gona for 3-4 months.

What a fecking shame. An absolute shame. Hope he has a speedy recovery.

feck <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Gone for the season.

May never even be the same player again.

736~~~
FFS

737~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if this as a detrimental effect to his mentality. Basically the same thing that happened to Cleverley after the Davies challenge.

I don't think he'll ever come back with the same tenacity and aggression after this.

Disgusting

fecking disgusting.

Ban slide tackles.

738~~~
Utter bollocks. What a shame.

739~~~
Can't believe our fecking luck!! 

He's been incredible. All the best Luke, hope for a quick recovery!

740~~~
feck. That's so disappointing.

741~~~
So sickening, looks like a broken leg. I hope he has a speedy recovery.

742~~~
I hope he comes back soon for us and picks up from where he left off but it looks bad. Our best player this season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

743~~~
Horrible injury, terrible tackle that's not been punished.

Hope it's a clean break at the most so he can have a good recovery.

744~~~
Anyone got a vid of the incident?

This is depressing stuff

747~~~
Just. feck.

748~~~
Literally the last player you'd want this to happen to. He's been absolutely brilliant this year. Doesn't deserve this.

749~~~
Moreno looked distraught as soon as he made the tackle. 

feck me. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

750~~~
Poor little sod.  <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>  Just when it was all coming together for him.  And us.

751~~~
Horrible, horrible injury. 

From a United point of view, it's obviously gutting. He's been brilliant and we'll miss him.

But I just feel so sorry for Shaw himself. It's such an horrific injury. It may affect his game in a big way. Even as a 20 year old, coming back from an injury like that may affect his pace and his mentality. I really, really feel for the lad right now.

752~~~
Gutted for him and us. Star performer with his great start to the season. Speedy recovery, Luke <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

753~~~
I'm sorry I'm just really really sad about this one.

But its very common after leg breaks that the player never regains their fearlessness.

754~~~
Saw the replay, it's horrific. He might never play again after that.

755~~~
Just saw a picture of it, I feel sick

756~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

757~~~
Gutted for the lad. Had a brilliant season so far, sickening to see it end like that.

758~~~
I wish they'd shut up about how this effects England.

759~~~
Broken leg/ankle. Could rob you of your speed/confidence to go forward.

760~~~
6 months minimum to play again. 

But let's be optimistic and hope for the best.

Good luck Luke !

761~~~
I wanna fecking cry for him. Looked so good, recently. 

It was a shite challenge, on second look.

762~~~
I think the opposite.  He might not be more attacking but it might make him take precautions & rightfully so.

763~~~
confidence definitely, but if it's a clean break, I'd expect physically he can make a 100% recovery, especially at 20.

Just hope it's not any knee impact as well, those are the worse ones.

764~~~
Terrible. After a start he had... Poor lad.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

fecks up our defense too if Rojo will play as a CB in the sense of Blind and Smalling looking brilliant thus far.

765~~~
I will be worried until I hear that there are zero complications. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I feel sick. Won't be able to enjoy this season until I see Luke Shaw back playing for us.

766~~~
He can take his time recovering. I just hope he makes a full recovery. Any official update on what happened?

767~~~
How's that the opposite of what I said. It seems pretty similar

768~~~
Gutted for him. Just hope he comes back the same player, all too often you see players return in body but not in spirit. 

Hopefully being young he will get through.

769~~~
he'll be in the best hands,  and get ideal rehab.

If it's a clean break, I wouldn't see any problems, just hope there's nothing knee related thrown in.

770~~~
I feel so sorry for the lad. He's been amazing for us. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I just hope he makes a full recovery.

771~~~
Gutted. Just <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I think he'll come back fine physically, but really it's mentally where you worry with injuries like these. Sometimes players are shot mentally and can never truly recover. Hopefully Shaw recovers well.

772~~~
... No words really. Hope he's well...

773~~~
I just saw it again and it's a sickner. Lower leg hanging off to the side. Poor, poor kid.

774~~~
Scouse bastards tagging the Man Utd twitter account and laughing at the Shaw injury. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

775~~~

776~~~
Pardon me, but surely that's his PA or something tweeting that? He must be in severe pain now, he is tweeting?

777~~~
You underestimate young people and their social media <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He is probably on some intense morphine and waiting for some scans or something similar.

778~~~
I must be a pretty fecking old 24 year old then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

779~~~
You probably remember cassettes and floppy discs you old bastard<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

780~~~
There's no way we'll have any shot at competing at the top without him. Our back 4 looked fully exposed when he went off. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

781~~~
I still have them at home and i am also 24 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

782~~~
Gutted about his injury more than the loss.

783~~~
I'm absolutely gutted for him. I really hope he makes a good recovery.

784~~~
Has been our best player this season together with Smalling. So sad this happened to him. Won't do our attacking play any good either as he was the only defensive player who really had the guts to make a run forward at times.

785~~~
Our best player gets a long term injury. Hope he is alright, feeling sorry for him. He started so well and this could have been a top top season for him. Get well soon!

786~~~
He is probably tweeting while being operated on. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

787~~~
I hope Moreno gets booed every time he touches the ball for the return game. The cnut.

788~~~
Our best player, absolutely beyond gutted.

789~~~
Confirmed it's a double leg fracture.

790~~~
On a scale of 1-10 how serious is that?

791~~~
I don't know at all. Discussing it with a few mates, it depends on how clean the fracture is. He's out for 6 months minimum in any case. 

Absolutely gutted for him. I actually feel angry right now.

792~~~
Such a shame the way it happened. Was such a typical Luke Shaw run, blowing past guys at top speed. Hopefully he can come back the same player. He looked set this season to become the best LB in the league.

793~~~
I am well and truly gutted for the lad. It's sickening to see this happen after the start he's had to the season.

I wish him all the very best to a speedy and healthy recovery.

794~~~
IIRC Valencia suffered double fracture of his Ankle around the same time with ligament damage also and was back in training in february. There have been cases of 3 or 4 month return to training too while some have taken double that.

Depends on severity i suppose and we'll know better after he has his surgery.

795~~~
Fecking Montero. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

796~~~
I hate Moreno. Both of em. On the bright side though it may mean we will be in for a lb or cb in the next transfer window

797~~~
As he made the run that ended in the injury, I was thinking - as Young was playing so badly - that Shaw is currently our best choice at right wing and would give defenders trouble with his ability to carry the ball against them.

798~~~
Gutted about his injury, looked terrible. Hope he can recover soon, but no sense in rushing it I think. The thing i am most afraid of is what it will do to his mental state. Will it make him play a bit more careful/hesitant in the future? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

799~~~
tbh there is no point rushing him back,  this season is now a write off for him just like last season was, just do everything to get him ready for July and the start of pre season and hope he doesn't need a third season before he looks like a Premier League player again

800~~~
Yeah his season is over I think. He'll miss the Euro's as well, Hodgson actually has good options in the LB position so he'll start planning for that now.

801~~~

802~~~
As well it should be - it would be pointless risking him in the final month or two of the year. And England is obviously low priority when it comes to his long term fitness and readiness for 2016.

803~~~
Agree. Unless he genuinely needs to get some minutes on the pitch here and there at the end of the season to clock hours, I think we should be cautious and take advantage of the fact that he is young and doesn't need to rush into anything.

804~~~
If he is medically cleared to play before the end of the season he should. He would want to and it would give him a big boost before the summer.

805~~~
This. 

If he were to play in the Euros then he would have to be back to full fitness and playing for us around February, March at the very latest I think. 

No, save him for far more important tasks.

806~~~
England already have a few LBs, while not as good as Shaw they are decent options. He'll only go if he's back playing and looking fit for the final couple months of the season, which I doubt will happen.

807~~~
I can see him returning to training in March if no further complications. If he does, he should make the Euros.

Not sure how we can stop him going if he is fit either as he will want to go.

808~~~
Really missed him today... if you just saw the space Mane got to whip the cross in esp. for the first one it was alarming. Can only hope Rojo settles in quickly and starts covering up. Because everytime Southampton breaked, they looked to exploit our left flank and successfully got in dangerous balls plenty of times.

Get well soon Luke. Hope to see him tearing up the field again next season

809~~~
Apparently, Moreno tackled another player yesterday and injured him.

810~~~
Luke putting weight on his foot. Greats news, hears to a speedy recovery!

Looks pretty inshape too. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

811~~~
It's not even in a cast?

812~~~
Christ he looks ripped.

Also, what was the actual damage then? Just a clean break or more?

813~~~
That's a pleasant surprise. Mate of mine broke both his fibula and tibia, as well, and was not supposed to bear any weight on that leg for about 2 or 3 months.

814~~~
Pretty sure we already had this news and pic in another thread.

815~~~
Look How swollen / red his foot is, is that normal? Guess it's because it's been elevated a lot maybe. 

Great to see he's already putting weight on it though, he must be a very quick healer.

816~~~
Did he really need to be topless? I mean... come on!

817~~~
The bones would have been repaired by plates, so I'd imagine a cast won't necessarily be needed since the bones won't be at risk of moving away from each other, he will just need to be careful with the weight baring and then within a few months when the bones have fused, the plate will most likely be removed <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

818~~~
The redness and swellings are part of the inflammatory process due to the injury and is normal after an injury. An elevated limb would push the blood to upper parts of the body.

819~~~
Luke Shaw is the new Phil Jones

820~~~
If I'd got all those ridiculous fat comments I'd probably be showing off the rig at every opportunity too.

821~~~
It's for the cafs benefit <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

822~~~
Oh, I'm cumming alright.

823~~~
Is it standard to be using crutches so soon after a leg break of this nature?

824~~~
I'd imagine once the swelling has gone mostly down it would be fine. I've fractured my ankle twice and not having it levitated is the problem because it swells up and starts throbbing, doubt it has any effect on the healing of the bone though. 

I'd be more worried that he's putting pressure on it already but who are we to talk when he surely has the best medical advise in the world.

825~~~
Well one thing we have to make sure is that he doesn't rush things. Maybe this is more a mental healing so the doctors want to show him that what happened to him is not so bad and that is healing quite quick. But you can't rush the healing of the bone, can you?

What they can do is to stimulate his muscles so he will not have so hard job to recover his strength and fitness but LVG already said in one of the press conferences that they are already doing that.

826~~~
I assume they've put a metal plate in his leg to hold it together so need for a cast. At least that's what they did with my arm. I imagine he would have to wear a protective boot whilst out and about though because if he knocked his leg on something it would hurt like hell.

827~~~
I'm not complaining!

He'll probably wear a boot when out and about. I was told having a cast is a bit more rare nowadays.

828~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

829~~~
Some physio work I guess? Maybe some aquatic training to keep him fit.

830~~~
What the feck? Is he Wolverine?

831~~~
His attitude is excellent.

832~~~
We've looked far worse without him. If he hadn't been injured then Young wouldn't be playing left back and might very well be replacing Memphis in the team. The Arsenal game could have been totally different.

833~~~
Missing your left back should not hinder the whole team

834~~~
Good lad!

835~~~
Damo will be happy.

836~~~
Good news. Maybe he'll be back for the last couple of months of the season.

837~~~
Brilliant that he is already back around the team and stuff. His absence was noticeable against Arsenal. A few occasions Young got turned on the wing and was unable to recover, you just know that Shaw would have made us so much more solid.

838~~~
But it does.  Shaw was arguably our best player at the start of the season.  Plus the balance we had in the team with him and Darmian on the flanks was brilliant.  We've lost that and we're struggling to find a replacement / substitute. 

Understand what you're saying, but losing one player can affect how a team plays (eg. Kompany for city, Terry for Chelsea etc)

839~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3263609/Luke-Shaw-hits-streets-Manchester-defender-steps-horror-leg-break-recovery.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tml?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490</a>

Out and about it seems. 

*He looks like Jake Gyllenhaal in that first picture

840~~~
If your left back is not very good, then yes.

841~~~
Rio will be delighted with that

842~~~
Well, we missed Denis Irwin for various spells and our entire team didn't suffer. And he was one of the best left backs to have played the game in English football so...

843~~~
Of course the team suffered. You lose one of your best players and replace them with a lesser player, then the team suffers. The extent of the suffering can vary, but the team will suffer.

844~~~
OK well put it this way, our entire left side didn't completely collapse when Denis was injured

845~~~
That's because our entire left side was a lot better then than it is now.


Losing one of your best players, and player of the season so far, will have an effect on the rest of the team, that much is obvious.

846~~~

847~~~
Glad to see the boy out and about. Though I thought he would have binned those tight pants. What is it with young lads nowadays and their taste in fashion<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

848~~~
Must have been a bad leg break for him to have to wear a double-leg cast.

849~~~
Absolutely terrible that a club like Manchester United couldn't put in the right support system to keep a roof over his head.

850~~~
We should have hired Ronda Rousey to carry him everywhere, no expense spared!

851~~~
This boy is special!

852~~~
Red crutches, good lad.

853~~~
Christ man. You're right.

854~~~
How much of a struggle was it to get those jeans on, especially in his condition

855~~~
Exactly my thoughts <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, skinny jeans don't go well with his big bum anyway

856~~~
Hope he recovers well.  Don't see any cast on his leg.  The medical field has improved leaps and bounds.

857~~~
It's no medical advancement, it's those skinny fecking jeans.

858~~~
But that's exactly what you wear skinny jeans for.

859~~~
We need this guy back so badly. Our whole defence seems to have gone to shit since his injury.

860~~~
Nice touch by PSV fans...

861~~~
Very nice touch indeed.  It isn't the fans fault that one of their players injured one of our players.

862~~~
Couldn't help noticing this gem. So, that didn't actually happen...

863~~~
It kinda did initially, seems to have settled down again.

864~~~
I think our defence is still solid, but we aren't as good going forwards since he has been injured as there are few overlapping runs now.

865~~~
Well that's true but at the time it looked like it would really stablize our defense. At this moment I actually feel the thing we miss most about him is his contribution in attack.

866~~~
I miss seeing him just burst past two or three opposition players.

867~~~
Does anyone know how he's recovering now? How much longer will he need? 2/3 months is my guess.

868~~~
Still think it would be better if he sat this season out and got a proper pre-season under his belt first.

869~~~
Agreed. We do not want another Rooney/Giggs situation.

Edit: <a class="username" data-user="66486, @Crackers" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66486/">@Crackers</a>  To answer your question, I heard there is a chance he could be fit to play by April, maybe even March - doubt that he will, though, with the way LVG deals with injured players (bar Rooney).

870~~~

871~~~
Can't wait to have him back in the team, alongside Martial he is the most exiting prospect we have and it was a joy to watch him bomb forward on that left side before his injury.

872~~~
Yep. I'd argue that in terms of being complete in a set position, he is our best player alongside De Gea. Been a huge miss

873~~~

874~~~

875~~~
Come on Luke, Cocaine wont aid your recovery.

876~~~
When is Luke ready to play again? He might have a massive impact on our performances.

877~~~
March earliest I'm guessing. Was around the time Valencia made his come back.

878~~~
What a huge loss he is. He is vital to that team.

879~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

880~~~
Young Luke coming back in March makes me nervous.  I know he's desperate to play but I'd rather see him brought back slowly starting in July.  Screw the Euros, no way could he be top form by then.

881~~~
I read somewhere that allowing too much time for recovery from injuries isn't a good thing either.

882~~~
Too much of anything is always a bad thing.  If Luke is actually cleared to train in March then I'm all for having him train in March.  It's hard to see how he could become match fit in just a few weeks of training, just as the season is coming to an end.

883~~~
Euros kick off in June right? Thats 3 months for him to get fit, it should be easily doable.

884~~~

885~~~
So excited to see him when he's back playing again, ahead of schedule too, brilliant young player.

886~~~
Just RT'd this

887~~~
I think I will always find it bizarre the obsession some have for celebrities.

888~~~
looking at the picture, facial features says he looks fit and not put on lots of weight like some might do when they're on a 6 month injury lay off.  still don't want him back playing too soon and would rather him have a summer of recovery rather than rush into our Euro squad

889~~~
He was quite possibly on his way to being our best player this season, we got robbed of not getting to see a combo of him and Martial on the left wing so far this season.

890~~~
Great news. He's one of the finest young footballers on the planet IMO, and seems to have a really good attitude as well to boot.

891~~~
That's actually as frightening a left wing combination as any in the premier league.

892~~~
Oh god yeah. Massively off topic but it's bizarre. All for supporting people and stuff, we're all guilty of that here, but some people literally take things beyond all rational reasoning.

893~~~
I hope he takes his time and builds himself up.again 

The shape he was in at the start of the season was superb 

Just don't want us rushing him and him ending up playing a lot of football and the Euros on top

894~~~

In our Europa League squad.

895~~~
As is Rojo, Valencia and Young. Wouldn't read too much into it. We are so short of senior players we can name all our long term injuries on the odd chance they might play

896~~~
Rojo, Valencia and Young could all return in the next 4-6 weeks.

897~~~
Those 3 haven't had their legs broken.

901~~~
CBJ, Adnan and Pereira are List B players, meaning they were born after 1.1.94 and have been registered with the club for at least 2 years since 15, so they don't take up a space on the 25 man squad but can still be named as a player or sub in the match-day team sheet.

Martial, for example, meets the age restriction but hasn't been with us long enough so still takes up a squad slot...

Great news if true

<b>Luke Shaw to play for Man United this season?
</b>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/luke-shaw-to-play-for-man-united-this-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/news/luke-shaw-to-play-for-man-united-this-season</a>

904~~~
Hopefully. We've massively struggled with link up from our full backs to wingers this season. Apart from CBJ, and Valera everyone else has been poor at it mostly. Riley looked good too in his cameos.

905~~~
so whats the schedule? surely if he was doing great than normal his comeback would be announced so I guess we must wait on him for a little while..

906~~~
Any word on when he's back? Wasn't there reports a few months back that it would be March?

907~~~

908~~~
Bit selfish of Hodgson to be putting pressure on us like that to rush him back.

909~~~
feck off, Hodgson.

910~~~
cnutish. The club shall not be dictated by England though.

911~~~
As far as I'm concerned, he should be missing the tournament on principle. Even if he's technically fit enough by then, he shouldn't go. He's very young, and has plenty of prospective international tournaments ahead of him. One bad tackle or collision causing a break or fracture to a leg that, yes, maybe could have done with a summer's reinforcement <i>just to make absolutely sure</i>, and the kid's career is over.

Hodgson's opinion counts for nothing. There's a good chance he won't be England manager after this tournament, and he knows it, so he's got no reason to worry about protecting these players' futures. He just wants a successful tournament at any cost.

912~~~
Yeah, he should just feck off. I hope Shaw himself sees it as better not to take any risks, but i doubt it, he probably wants it badly if he thinks he is fit enough.

He was a 27m pounds investment, i hope the club tell Hodgson where to go.

913~~~
Luke is young and will be playing for England for a long time. Feck off Hodgson you owl bastard, let him take as long as he needs.

914~~~
I hope he doesn't play the Euros. But that aint going to happen.

915~~~
Shaw's surely smart enough to give it a miss no matter how much he wants to go. Wait this tournament out and he'll definitely be Englands no.1 for the remaining tournaments in his career.

916~~~
The guy is a fool. So we should risk our players future cause of your bloody selection. Ugly bastard.

917~~~
roy is literally looking to take a plane full of injured, unfit players

918~~~
Do one hodgson. We need a fully fit Shaw next season so i'd be happy for him to skip the euros and concentrate on full recovery. Its scary how well he started the season, probably in the top 2 or 3 players on the pitch every game, one of very few players I think everyone on here agrees is class along with martial and dave.

919~~~
And complain about it when he inevitably fails.

920~~~
To be fair I am sure if you asked Shaw he would be keen to play at a Euro Championship. Roy has just said he'd like to have a chance considering his form at the start of this season. He is far and away England's best left back so I think some a being a bit dramatic about his comments!

921~~~
I don't think it's anything to do with principle. It's really down to biology, if the bone is completely healed why shouldn't he go. If he's healthy then I'd prefer him to get a few competitive games under his belt.

The last thing Shaw needs right now is more time away from competitive football.

922~~~
There's much more to it than just the bone being healed though. He'll have lost muscle mass in that leg, so they need to build that back up, and do it properly, otherwise he's vulnerable to another break. Plus any imbalance picked up during his recovery needs to be corrected otherwise he'll be prone to muscle injuries elsewhere. There isn't a simple line you can draw between 'healed' and 'not healed'. It's about how ready you want him to be before he starts playing again.

And your last line is clearly wrong. The last thing Shaw needs right now is another injury, or any problems resulting from not giving the broken leg time to heal. He's missed the season - an extra summer away from football isn't going to hurt him. It's not as if he's still trying to establish himself at the club; he proved once and for all at the start of this season that he should be a no-questions-asked regular in the first XI, and no manager is going to have any doubts that when fit he's first choice.

923~~~
Right but if all those boxes have been ticked, if the bone has healed and the muscle rebuilt why not play? What's the point in not playing IF healthy based on some kind of principle.

Your whole assumption is that he's not ready and will get injured. If qualified medics say he's ready then let's start getting him match fit.

A pre season with us won't do that given how inadequate they now are.

924~~~
You're missing the point. There is no objective point where he's suddenly 'healthy'. It's subjective. One qualified medic might say he's ready one day, another might say he needs another couple of weeks before it's safe. My point is that Hodgson will inevitably be willing to risk Shaw much earlier than, say, Van Gaal. But if we're talking about what's in Shaw's best interests, he'd be better off erring towards a more cautious timescale, because missing one tournament so early in his career isn't going to hurt him but another injury now would massively feck him over.

As for pre-season, pretty much every player who's ever mentioned it in an interview has said that it's as crucial as anything else a player does in defining how their season goes. That 'when I've got a full pre-season under my belt' cliché didn't come out of nothing. International tournaments don't bring match fitness. They're stop-start, high-stress, involve as much travelling as playing, and aren't really anything like a league season. You don't go to a Euros to get match fit for the upcoming season any more than you'd prepare for a marathon by playing a couple of games of tennis.

925~~~
If the medical people at United and England say he's fit then you go with their advice. That's what we employ them for.

Extending his time away from competitive football by another two months for no real reason other than fear will only cause more rustiness.

A United pre season consists of about 5 games. Last year most of the players didn't even get 90mins. The training was sub standard, fitted in around flights and commercial activities. If that's all he has after 9 months out its guaranteed he won't be ready for the beginning of the new season.

Where as he could be getting proper competition training with England and competitive games. He'll then be ready for us.

Don't forget it's possible he'll have a couple of months training with us before he even joins up with England.

926~~~
And this season the tour is 2 games so there'll be less football for him.

927~~~
This is what I mean. You seriously think their assessments are going to match up? I doubt it. England's medics will want to be able to tell Hodgson he can go. United's will be as cautious as possible, knowing the club has no particular reason to rush him back. So when he's in that subjective zone where he probably <i>could</i> go but he also <i>could</i> take a bit longer and reduce the risk of injury, they're unlikely to agree.

And again, you're just giving your opinion of pre-season, apparently based on how many games we play. Those games aren't really about preparation any more, they're about the fanbase and the income and the brand. The important work of pre-season happens on the training pitch, and the players and coaches - the people whose opinions are actually relevant - are unanimous in saying that a good, full pre-season is crucial to having a good start to the season.

928~~~
Isn't that just in China? It wouldn't surprise me though. I remember last year they were landing somewhere at 10pm and then training just to fit it in. If you compare it to the pre seasons of smaller clubs you realise how inadequate ours are.

That won't be sufficient for Shaw to get into match shape.

929~~~
Why do you doubt their assessments will match up? Its science not art. Take it back a step then, if just United's medics say he's fit why shouldn't he go? Can you imagine telling him that despite being physically ready he's not going because of "principle." What a wasted opportunity to get fit and take part in an international tournament it would be.

Everybody agrees on a good pre season being crucial. So get MUTV and watch ours. You'll see just how compromised the training is.

930~~~
Yeah, we'll most likely have a game at OT too but still not much of a preseason.

931~~~
Rooney's testimonial is before the season starts too I think, and that'll be against Everton with the regular teams playing against each other.

932~~~
Yeah its not enough for most players but especially for Shaw. If his first competitive game is beginning of next season that'll be 11 months out. During that period all he'd have had is a handful of slow, poor standard pre season games. Probably only one or two full games. There's no way he'll be anywhere near match fit for 2016/17.

Hence me wanting him to go with England if declared fit to do so.

933~~~
Unless he can play a couple of games for us before the end of the season it'd be bonkers to think about Euro 2016.

You don't just sit out 9months, train for a couple of weeks and go to the big tournaments.

If he's fit, but not ready, what could be more sensible then letting him have another 3months proper pre season to get even more certain

934~~~
It's a no brainer. If he's fit he should go to the Euros. He's missed more than enough games since joining us.

935~~~
Haha all these caf 'medical experts' saying he should miss the euros, if he's fit play the lad I'm sure he's eager to get back. No need to rush him but the medical team know what they are doing and won't do anything stupid that could harm him long term. I expect him to be back playing for us anyway before the seasons out.

936~~~
Exactly. Can't believe any United fan thinks otherwise.

'He's missed a whole fecking season for us but sure, let's let him go and play three games in another dispiriting England campaign. Fingers crossed rushing him back doesn't feck up his entire career before it's even started, eh? After all, how else will he possibly get match fit?' <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

937~~~
Do you have any knowledge at all of how long a leg break takes to recover from? He's due back next month and honestly I'd be surprised if he didn't play the last few games of our season as well as trading for months. If he's ready he's ready, I don't get how people can't understand that.

938~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You've completely ignored the fact that the season when Shaw went to a tournament with England he turned up not fit enough for United and took a while to get going as a result. Whereas the season when Shaw <i>didn't</i> go to a tournament he used a personal trainer to get absolutely razor-edge fit and exploded into form straight away, played every game for us and was our second best player (after Smalling) right up until his injury.

There's this thing called training. I know you don't get to watch it on MUTV but it does actually happen. Quite a lot of it, during pre-season. Some might say it's a more useful tool for pre-season fitness than three or four disappointing England games.

939~~~
Read my original post. I'm not saying he shouldn't go, just that he shouldn't go if he's not managed to come back and play for United before the end of the season, and that it should be <i>United</i>'s medical team whose opinion counts, not Hodgson and England's medics, who are inevitably biased towards the short-term advantages of having Shaw available in France.

940~~~
Well fair enough I'm inclined to agree because we both know it's in his best interests not to be rushed back in any way. I'm not sure I agree about the Engkand medical team tho, they are not stupid and I don't think they will be looking short term. England has plenty of LB cover so they know there is no need to rush him back. I'm sure they have his best intentions at heart because they know he could be England left back for the next 10 years.

941~~~
Pretty sure his injury was this season? In addition to him possibly being fit for the end of the season.

942~~~
It's like people have spent too much time playing football manager or something, and ignore the other times we've rushed players back for tournaments. Invariably they're crap at best, and ruck themselves up further at worst. Falcao being the best example of the latter. (though not necessarily our player at the time)

943~~~
Shaw wouldn't really be rushed back though. When he got the injury in mid September, March/April time was always mooted as his return and everything indicates he's doing well and on schedule.

Different to Rooney's injury in 2006 when he fractured a metatarsal at the end of April and was definitely rushed back for that World Cup.

944~~~
True, but let's see how he does if / when he comes back for United. No point taking him if he's still rusty. The Euros is not the place to be trying to build up match fitness.

945~~~
Ok then.

How do you know his last tournament caused the following seasons injuries? On what medical basis are you claiming this.

You're right he started this season great after a regular pre season. The whole point of this conversation though is that this time he'll have been out for 9 months. He's in a completely different postion to last summer which makes your comparison pointless.

946~~~

947~~~
Shaw <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

948~~~
I really hope that United and England are not crazy enough to play Shaw now or to take him to Euros. He should get all the needed time to heal properly and then start playing in preseason.

949~~~
I've banged on about this already but we've only got three pre season games. It's highly unlikely he'll get 90mins in all of them as everybody will need game time. On top of that LvG has said training will be poor due to the China humidity.

It's going to be a miracle if Shaw is anywhere near fit for the new season. I really dislike these corporate pre seasons.

950~~~
I assume there will be lots of closed door pre season games.

951~~~
Can't say I recall that happening before. Even if we do who are the opposition? What's the standard?

952~~~
I hope he is back on the pitch playing as soon as possible.  If that means a game or two at the end of the season and potentially sneaking his way into the England squad for the Euros, even better!

953~~~
I can't wait to hear the reception he gets when he comes on, hopefully he'll return at Old Trafford towards the end of the season.

954~~~
It's a stepping stone progression. Join training for non contact, do some light contact, join the proper sessions, play a training game, have a walk around in the reserves (U21s)...

and only then think about easing him into the first team.

I dare say we've not got time to allow this full routine this season. At most, if there's nothing on game week 38, I'd give him a short sub appearance v Bournemouth. Just to give him a feel of involvement again, and really give him incentive for the summer break.

955~~~
Yep, that's what I'm hoping for. 20 minutes or so in the last game, just to get him out there in the action again so hopefully he can go into the pre-season in a good frame of mind.

956~~~
Didn't Rooney play in one whilst the rest of the squad were in the far east one time? I'm sure it was during the "angry and confused" period.

Edit: He did, along with Vidic and Hernandez. No idea what the standard was like though.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/5051047/Wayne-Rooney-returns-as-United-beat-Betis-3-0-behind-closed-doors.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepag...nited-beat-Betis-3-0-behind-closed-doors.html</a>

957~~~
That is just an u21 pre-season game. If Luke Shaw is on the tour then he wouldn't able to play in games like that.

Based on the picture the starting XI for that match was:
Johnstone
Vermijl - Keane - Vidic - Blackett
Cole - Petrucci - Charni - Nani
Hernandez - Rooney

958~~~
Presumably a few more will be added. 

We play Dortmund on the 22nd July.
We play City on the 25th July. 
Then on 3rd Aug-Rooneys testimonial. 

The PL doesn't start till the 13th August. So we could easily add another two games.

959~~~
Can't see us fitting two games into those ten days personally. With the potential for injuries so close to the beginning of the season I think LvG would rather train.

960~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> subtle wum

961~~~
Haha wasn't intentional.

962~~~
I'll see your advice and raise you a Bo-Jack.

We're pretty well covered at left back, starting with Bo-Jack.  Darmian even does a decent job there.  Whatever it takes to get Shaw back to the right physical and mental place we need to push Luke along to get there but not push him too quickly.  September, October...fine.  But I suspect he'll be good to go in August.

963~~~
I hope he's rushed back and starts at the Euros, there I said it. I think England really good go far this tournament and Shaw is by far our best option at left back.

964~~~
Any chance he will feature for us before the end of the season?

965~~~
Needs to take all the time he needs!

966~~~
No according to Van Gaal.

967~~~
That's the right answer.  Tofu has been immense and Luke should take all the time he needs to get back to 100% fitness, physically and mentally.  That might be July 1 but there's no point in taking any kind of risk whatsoever with an earlier return date to intense training and competitive action.

968~~~
I'll be pretty pissed if he goes to the Euro's. Hope Wayne has had a word with him since he's gone on record saying one his biggest regrets was rushing himself back for the 2006 World Cup.

969~~~
Not sure why some are worried. Pretty sure Roy won't pick him. He's not come back yet and at most it looks like he'll get a few mins in our final game. Baines, Bertrand, Rose and Cresswell are all ahead of him. England aren't desperate for LBs.

970~~~
Pretty sure he won't be going to the euros. Roy can feck himself.

971~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/default/files/tofu-main.jpg" src="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/default/files/tofu-main.jpg"/>

972~~~
Can't see it helping anybody.  Even if it doesn't actually set him back, he's not exactly known for finding it easy to reach ideal physical condition - can't see him being fit enough to be of use in about 6 weeks time, when he's not even in full training yet.

973~~~
I hope he doesn't go euros. Unnecessary. I've seen how some fans want Wilshere to go to Euros. It's April and he's just got back to fitness. Not sure it's the risk you want to take.

974~~~
1) If Shaw is fit then he's two levels above that named players

2)
Baines: Will never play again for England under Hodgson
Bertrand: Good player but nothing special
Rose: Good player but nothing special
Cresswell: Good player but nothing special and has never played for England

975~~~
He may well be but the chances of him being fit, never mind match fit looks extremely unlikely at this point. Despite his ability, it would not make footballing sense to pick Shaw, after playing only say 30 minutes of football within several months above any of these guys. Even if he is physically capable, he will likely be rusty anyway.

976~~~
He won't go to the Euros, if Roy is to have a brainfart around squad selection it's likely to be Wilshere.

977~~~
Shaw not going to the Euro's is probably best for Shaw himself. Some of you need a good talk with yourselves... 

Think about what that also means. It means an abbreviated summer training with the team when he needs to be eased in slowly so that he's at his peak for our opening match of next season.

978~~~
He's only 20. There will be other tournaments.

He should work on building up his fitness over the summer and then come back ready to go in early August.

979~~~
Oh sorry i didn't mean he should go to the Euros.
But you have said "England aren't desperate for LBs" and i just think England don't have a quality replacement for Shaw.
Shaw (if he can stay fit) will surely reach Ashley Cole's level and the others like Baines/Rose/Gibbs/Bertrand/Cresswell are just "Wayne Bridge's".

980~~~
Some people seem to think that going to the Euros would be a good thing but after an injury like the one he suffered his training routine will naturally be tailored towards properly rehabbing the injury and allowing him to build up to sustainable and long term fitness rather than racing towards ticking the box marked "match fitness". Doing that while being away with England, in a pressured environment and with people whose responsibility would be to get him ready for the games in the Euros would be a huge risk, IMO. His long term fitness won't be particularly enhanced by going to the Euros but it could be massively damaged.

981~~~
Good post brophs

Brilliant player with amazing potential for us.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Kind-hearted Manchester United star Luke Shaw steps in to ensure dying fan gets to Wembley for the FA Cup final</b></span>

It's amazing how he's barely played for us but he's still my favourite player in the current team.

986~~~
That's fantastic. Also nice to know our fans were willing to give up their tickets for the old fella... great story.

987~~~
Nice one Luke. I really really can't wait until he gets back, probably going to have to wait until next season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

988~~~
We have so many promising young players, I almost forgot about Shaw when thinking about it. I cant wait to see him back.

989~~~
Class story, feel really sorry for that guy but it would be lovely if his dying wish came true.

990~~~
Can't wait to have a proper left back again. Watching Rojo struggle there is awful.

991~~~
"<i>Retired water board ‘listener’ William became an avowed United fan after meeting and becoming friends with ‘Busby Babe’ Duncan Edwards while the pair did their national service as 18-year-olds.</i>"

Incredible. Fantastic gesture from Luke, I hope he makes it to the final and the boys win him a trophy to celebrate.

992~~~
He almost has become the next Evra in a way.

Absolutely everyone associated with the club is routing for him. He has an excellent attitude and seems to be over the moon to be playing for United. 

The club's next sweetheart. Don't think I've ever wanted a player to fulfil his potential more. He needs to come back from the injury with the exact same on the field attitude as before the injury - can't imagine how difficult that will be for him - real test of character.

993~~~
Evra is a legend. Shaw has had a handful of good games. He wasn't even all that great in his first season here, let's not get carried away.

994~~~
At the start neither had Evra, the promise was there but it took him time also.

995~~~
Hope he doesn't play till pre-season. Just recover now, skip the Euros and can be eased in at the start of next season.

996~~~
This. He's a legend in the making. It felt like our season was over already when he got injured. Can't wait to see him play again.

997~~~
In the leaked England line up he has been included in the squad with Smalling and Rooney.

998~~~
Whoever did it spelt Clyne's name wrong. Looks bollocks to me.

999~~~
That would be incredibly stupid.

1000~~~
England have Rose and Bertrand, and Cresswell too, so I don't see the idea of taking Shaw to the Euros.

1001~~~
Don't see it happening too. Even if Shaw may be fine physically, he has no match fitness whatsoever.

Also having looked at that squad. Rose ahead of Bertrand? Is Danny Welbeck injured again? No way Roy would drop him out the squad, let alone not have him on standby. 

Looks suspicious.

1002~~~
Yeah Welbeck got injured yesterday, something to do with his meniscus.

1003~~~
There is no way they just happened to make the list and leak it after Welbeck's injury and spell Clyne's name wrong.

1004~~~

We're getting closer and closer to not having to put up with Marcos fecking Rojo.

The Chubby Bastard is back!

1008~~~
This is the only thing keeping me positive as a United fan at the minute. Cannot wait to have him back next season linking up with Martial down the left and hopefully no more of Marcos Rojo

1009~~~
Surely the best left wing combo for years to come<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
<span style="color: #ffffff">Assuming we hold on to them of course</span>

1010~~~
Hopefully his injury hasn't effected him too much as a player, one of the most talented young defenders in Europe at his best, best of luck, Luke!

1011~~~

1012~~~
I wonder if Smalling's dog took that photo

1013~~~
Not surprising. Love his dedication.

1014~~~
Said this a few times in the newbies but our season would have been entirely different without his injury. Even the passage of play that led up to his injury ( Took it past a few players, looked for a one-two and carried his run into the box) is something we haven't seen since. With Martial and Shaw we would have a double threat on the left where as now its just Martial doing everything as Rojo doesn't offer anything at all for defenders to be concerned about.

His return to full fitness is more important than any signing we make, provided he hasn't lost any of that ability or drive.

1015~~~
He has a great attitude. Wish some of our players had the same desire.

1016~~~
He really is awesome.

1017~~~

1018~~~
Would have been mad to take any risks this soon back.

As long as he's back, there's no reason he shouldn't get back to full ability and form with this. If it was more ligaments, especially knee, you'd have more doubt.

very comfy with him having an extra 3months to make sure.

Disaster of a season for him, and having him available would certainly have made things easier for everyone. For starters, we'd have had some semblance of help down the left for Martial!

1019~~~
it is bizarre how the team declined due to losing a young fullback

1020~~~
pretty sure that shaw wasn't the main reason for it. sure he was great, but i think we could have 11 messi's in each position and as long as we're coached to lose/draw we're not going anywhere.

1021~~~
Coached to lose ?? Are you fecking kidding me ?

1022~~~
He'll walk back into the England side. Rose is a nothing player, and Bertrand is good but he's not as good as Shaw.

1023~~~
And that is the reason why United fans shouldn't be so furious with Hodgson's comments in the last months.......Shaw is three level above Rose or Bertrand or Gibbs and Hodgson knows that.

1024~~~
... Hyberbole.

1025~~~
Apart from Martial he was our only attacking option on the wing. Rojo and Darmain gave us 0 threat. CBJ was better and we improved dramatically when Valencia came back to right back. Our threat from out wide full backs and wingers has been chocking us all year.

1026~~~
yeah, and Memphis seemed to rely on him overlapping aswell. Once was gone he looked a bit lost, so Shaw did have a big effect on the team

1027~~~
Memphis has done badly when Shaw's played too. His injury has barely made a difference on that front.

1028~~~
I don't know why people here always overrate impact of injured player during the time he played.<b> We scored just 6 goals in 5 games with Shaw this season</b>, and three of those goals came in one game against Liverpool. During those 5 games we played Newcastle, Aston Villa and Swansea, teams that will turn out to be terrible defensively throughout the season. Tottenham and Liverpool were only decent teams out of 5 teams we played.

We were equally bad attacking wise as we were for rest of the season, we had total of just 18 shots on target in 5 games, that's just 3,6 per game. Our average is actually bit higher than that this season - 3,8, but both are very low anyway, so let's not rewrite history.

Now, I am not underrating Shaw, I said at start of the season that he was our best player alongside Smalling for me, and not just that, but his standard of play in general was very high, and I personally think if he can repeat that form after he recovers he can become one of the best fullbacks in the world. I just disagree that we were "much better in attack" while he was playing because that obviously isn't true. He is better than the likes of Rojo, but even all attack fullback like Marcelo would hardly improve us alone because our play in final third was and still is terrible. We are playing slow and terrible football and no fullback could improve us that much. With Shaw we were bit better in our play on our left side, but we were hardly impressive in the final third even with him. Actually, I am not sure we were any worse attacking wise when BoJack played there, I remember him creating few excellent goalscoring chances with his crossing. Of course, we would be better if we had Shaw instead of Rojo this season, but let's not pretend Shaw created 3 chances all alone every game.

Btw, hopefully he continues next season where he left before the injury, I believe he can come back stronger.

1029~~~
And of those 6 goals, 1 was OG, 2 were set pieces and one was a Martial special.

As good as he looked, our season would have carried on in much the same vein even if he hadn't been injured thanks to the ineptitude of Van Gaal.

1030~~~
You are judging Shaw's value on the pitch by goals scored and shots on target. Well done

1031~~~
Agreed, although his presence throughout the whole season would almost certainly have been worth at least an additional point somewhere along the line. Assuming we beat Bournemouth tonight that would have to be seen as a fairly big difference.

1032~~~
If you read my post you would <i>maybe</i> understand what I said. Maybe. It's not that hard.

1033~~~
Probably but had De Bruyne not got injured City might have sneaked in an extra point somewhere as well. If's and but's really.

1034~~~
It's all we've got

1035~~~
give over, you admit Shaw was one of our best players playing at a general high level then say he wouldn't have made much difference to the rest of the season. He was linking up well with whoever happened to be infront of him, as some has said there was no chemistry on the right side at all and Shaw was the main thrust on the left. that was removed suddenly we looked blunt. So the team was compromised by his absence

1036~~~
I haven't read through the thread much, but are people really saying we will be that much better in attack when he rejoins the first 11?

If so, then I probably agree with you, that I don't think it will make a world of difference in attack. What I do think is that we will become far more competent in our overall play since we will finally have a decent full back. If he can stay fit, he is a guaranteed starter every game, and we don't have many of them in our squad unfortunately. The more we have, the better the overall performance will be. The 11 players on the pitch must have experience of playing together - team chemistry is not just a stat in Fifa, it's a real thing. Leicester are the prime example.

1037~~~
I dont understand how having the best fullback in the league available wont help the team. Of course he will add point at both ends of the pitch because that what the best players do. Seems to me people underrating the fullback position in general here.

1038~~~
<i>... attacking wise -</i> I don't know how hard it is to understand that. It was an answer to people who think we would be much better in attack.
We changed every one of our player in the first XI during the season and our team always looked clueless up front no matter who played. Martial is pretty much our only player that can make a difference alone, we played the likes of Lingard over Mata at times and we didn't look any worse or any better, because our style stayed the same. As I posted, our goalscoring record and attacking play was nothing better with Shaw in comparision with our average. It's pretty obvious that playing different players in this team hardly has much difference to our attacking play, especially fullback who isn't known for his end product anyway, we are incapable of creating too much mostly because our style of play, not just the players.

1039~~~
For me its like having a new signing, cant wait to have him back. Him and TFM will be brilliant for us next season i reckon

1040~~~

1041~~~
Here here, he was looking superb for us before his injury, even given his premature end I would still say he was one of our best players this season.

1042~~~
It'll take him a year to really start to find his form again I think, there really is no rush though.

1043~~~
What is the latest? Do we expect him at the start of the season or is he a fair bit off?

1044~~~
No rush I have confidence in his return. Plus we have CBJ who can play there. Just please no more Rojo

1045~~~
I haven't heard anything to suggest that he won't be there for pre season like the rest of the lads.  I hope that's the case as he could be such a big player for us next season, if he can rediscover his pre-injury form of course.  He could be a beast under Mourinho..

1047~~~
Thanks. Hope he gets a solid pre season in. The hardest part coming back from a break is more mental than physical. Robson broke his leg three times at West Brom before coming to us so let's hope some of that rubs off on Luke!

1048~~~
I swear Luke Shaw's twitter is just weird at times. Though he does seem to have been working hard (no sexual innuendo <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>) during the off-season. Can't wait for him and Martial together <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> ( I swear I'm not gay <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>)

1049~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Look at him.

1050~~~
Pace and power down that left. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Shredded motherfecker <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1052~~~
He'll probably lose about 8lbs in pre season.

1053~~~
But the media said he was fat!

1054~~~
get back to gym and work hard like other players, your vacation has been long enough, ffs!

1055~~~
What the photo doesn't show is that he's been slacking on leg day.

1056~~~
He looks like a proper fit footballing athlete in that pic.  Ie. Memphis for me is needs to lose about 7lb in muscle and get some speed back. 

Some footballers are looking more like 100 meter guys who are just bulk muscle for short term gain but they can't run 9k a match.  
Good luck luke, like many on here hope you get that form of early season back and we've arguably one of the best left sides in Europe with like and martial

1057~~~
He's in perfect shape for a footballer. Memphis is at least 3 time the size of him.

1058~~~
We should be so much improved this season with Mourinho in charge, a fit again Shaw...rashford from the start, Bailly, and hopefully Mkhitaryan, Zlatan and maybe even others

1059~~~
Has anyone pulled the like a "new signing" one out yet? Since we're trotting out cliches and all.

1060~~~
Vacation? Rehabilitation after such a bad injury is anything but vacation. He probably worked harder than the other players did to recover from it.

Physically he will get back to what he was before the injury with time. The question is if he's able to overcome the mental barrier every time he's running with the ball and there's a possibility of a 50% challenge.

1061~~~
He'll be like a new signing for us!
<span style="color: #ffffff">I know</span>

1062~~~
I was only 10% serious

1063~~~
Anyone else staying away from the Shaw thread pretending he doesn't exist until he comes through his first few games. I can't stand the thought of finding out if he has suffered a set back. 

A fit Luke Shaw will be immense for us. Defensively and offensively he's going to add a whole new dimension to our game if he gets his old fitness back.

1064~~~
I've been doing this all season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Can't wait to see him line up for us again this coming season! He was a joy to watch early season, a definite bright spark. Can't wait to see him link up with Martial on the left.

1065~~~
Its a really weird feeling, normally when a player of ours gets injured.. I am not too fussed, I remember Rooney and his metatarsal etc, I was eagerly anticipating his return and refreshing every 5 minutes. This injury just traumatised me and I just want him to come back 100%.

1066~~~
I had a horrible pit in my stomach when I saw the replay. The players performance against Ajax that match was really telling. What made it worse was that it came from a moment of excitement where Luke broke through the defence with great energy. I'm sure he'll come back 100%, the tidbits of his recovery I've seen on social media seem to indicate so!

1067~~~
Lets hope so.. its a cliche to say Player X is a new signing but with him it really does feel like that!

1068~~~
The link up play with Martial will hopefully be godly...

1069~~~
Can only hope it would be Beckham and Neville-esque. Only Shaw and Martial are both arguably more talented/exciting than David Beckham and Gary Neville. I have never been more certain of 2 players becoming world class.

1070~~~
Potential-wise, I most certainly agree! 
Do we think Shaw will start our first pre-season game?

1071~~~
PSV? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1072~~~
Will be brilliant seeing him in the line-up again but I doubt we'll be seeing him anywhere near his best this season (if ever <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>). I remember when Ramsey had the same injury his first season back was almost a write-off, with people saying he'd never be the same player again. Even if he's 100% physically, it will take him a long time to shake the fear of another serious injury every time he gets on the ball and that tiny loss in focus makes a huge difference in performance at this level.

1073~~~
Also looking at people predicting him to be in Jose’s first starting XI, I think it’s realistic to see him playing full matches by the end of the year and hopefully at his best during the second half of the season.

1074~~~
Welcome back btw, I think you are making a solid point about how it will take the boy some time before he is back to his best and its certainly true. I hope Mourinho will look to use CBJ more early on and monitor Shaw as the the season progresses.

1075~~~
I agree with this.

Would not surprise me if Blind plays a lot of games at left back next season.

1076~~~
Yeah agree.  Probably why I disagree with those who say no rush. I don't want him to return before its medically safe but he's been away long enough now.

1077~~~
I'd love for him to come back as he started the season. I think he was our best player in most of the games he played in last season. He is also criminally underrated by a lot of people.

Unfortunately I can't see it happening though. Would love to see him back to his best but I don't think it will happen. Would be a shame to see such a great talent wasted, he's got it all. Dribbling, pace, height and physicality etc etc.

1078~~~
As long as you keep up the faith, eh...

1079~~~
Can't speak for everyone else but I have every faith in him getting back to his best. Eventually. Just think that this season will be too soon to expect to see the same player he was leading up to that injury.

1080~~~
I do agree, I was directing my post more at the guy directly above, which is very doom and gloom. Good to see you back on the forums, btw.

1081~~~
I'm interested to know why you don't think he will be back to his best. There are tons of players who have had bone breaks and produced their best form. 
Unlike muscle and ligament injuries, bone injuries rarely affect the player long term. 
Think your being overly pessimistic.

1082~~~
I think it'll probably take time to shake off the cobwebs. He's not played a single match for a year.

1083~~~
Oops. My bad. Only back a day and I'm missing points already! Start as you intend to continue, right? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1084~~~
That's inevitable. But the poster above is suggesting he may never be the same player.

1085~~~
Pogue!

1086~~~
He'll be grand

1087~~~
Howerya, Pex. All good?

1088~~~
All great my end, good to see you back, what drew you back in?

1089~~~
To be brutally honest, mainly because I'm looking for tickets to a game. Plus the fact we've finally got a decent manager, so there'll hopefully be a lot less doom and gloom. Which was draining.

1090~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Man couldn't take another season of Van Gaal.

1091~~~
Good to see Shaw back training with the others. Hopefully he'll be ready for the start of the season, although I'm not too worried about left back.

1092~~~
He will, he had already started training with the first team towards the end of last season. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1093~~~
He'll be fine. Better than fine. He's got everything he needs (not just the ability, but support and belief from the club) to be the best left back in the league for the next decade.

1094~~~
Very happy to see you back posting, mate! Always a voice of reason.

1095~~~
First game is against Wigan.

This is off topic but Jackson also states that Phil Jones will be first choice next season next to Chris Smalling.

1096~~~
Looking forward to it. 

In the Phil Jones news - I think it's because he's in the Terry-mold.

1097~~~
Mourinho is great at stopping injuries, if he can get Phil Jones fit, and i mean IF, then he will be fantastic for us.

1098~~~
He's a football manager, not a witch doctor.

1099~~~
Jones is so overrated. Wish we sold him last year.

1100~~~
Even on the rare occasions he's fit he's pretty terrible for us. Hopefully just guess work as usual from Jackson.

1101~~~
Whilst he has all the grace of a mattress as well as an utter disregard for personal safety, he's had enough games where he's been good to have hope (bolstered by a good dose of Jose).

But Shaw's back! Hooray. Best player (worst trousers) at the club last season until the injury.

1102~~~
As in he falls apart like a chocolate orange?

Great to see Shaw back, hopefully he has a bit more luck from here on.

1103~~~
Jones is class but because of injures, I am also sick of him. 

As for Shaw, why is everyone so confident he'll be back at his best? I am genuinely asking because I am not good with injuries and stuff so I have personally been very sad about the prospects. Wasn't eduardo never the same player after his injury? 

Could someone give me reason to believe he will be back playing like he was?

1104~~~
He could do a Tony V and win POTY first season back?

1105~~~
Depends on the player. You cite Eduardo but Henrik Larsson broke his twice and came back better.

Shaw is young and has had great medical attention and a sensible time to recover. He may not come back the same, but there's a good chance he will. Optimism my dear Shamans, optimism.

1106~~~
Fair enough. Sounds like it doesn't mean he will never be the player he could have been. I am optimistic. Even if he doesn't become what was once promised he will do the job!

1107~~~
Brilliant to have him fit and ready to play. He's been really upbeat and positive throughout it all so hopefully it won't affect him mentally.
