1~~~
Will he play more this season than last?

2~~~
Fantastic player but can't see him playing week in week out at the premier league level. All those muscles injuries seemed to have caught up to him last season, atleast now we have better alternatives than Daley Blind.

3~~~
He was bossing it for the first half an hour. Was pretty ropey after that. Especially in the 2nd half.

4~~~
Thought he was still brilliant today, will no doubt play a very key role this year

5~~~
his midfield partner (in a  4<b>4</b>2 midfield) was not up to it today, that would be suicidal against Barca

6~~~
The disguise he puts on his passes is just class. Still going to be one of our main players for the upcoming season.

7~~~
Looking forward to seeing him and Schweinie  boss the midfield  in a 4-2-3-1 <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>!

8~~~
His handling speed was quite worrying to me at times. But it's just pre season so fair enough. Will be grrat if he reaches last seasons level for us this season too.

9~~~
The errors he was accountable for today weren't Schneiderlin's fault though. He cheaply gave away the ball on a good few occasions whilst not really under much pressure.

10~~~
Still our best midfielder.

11~~~

12~~~
He's so smart and technically solid in possession. Has to play whenever he's healthy and we're up against high-pressing or top quality.

13~~~
Away from home in big games I'd like to see us line up with Carrick/Schneriderlin in a 4-2-3-1, super solid and hard to beat. Otherwise I think him and Schneiderlin should rotate as the single DM in a 4-3-3.

14~~~
Not at his best tonight but he's always been a slow starter.

15~~~
Looked off the pace for much of the tour. Passing miles below his usual standard. Got us in trouble several times with awful passes at various point throughout the tour.

16~~~
Didn't watch the game. How did he get on with Bastian?

17~~~
They didn't combine a great deal. The big problem was the lack of cover whenever PSG hit us on the break; either they were incorrectly positioned or they didn't have the legs, probably a combination of the two. Defensively they look a painfully slow combination.

18~~~
Defensively, I think the bigger problem was the center back but they were a bit slow in terms of closing down between the two of them. Nothing wrong with either on the ball though IMO, and we looked a lot more threatening in the first half compared to the second.

19~~~
Thanks guys.

Lack of dynamism was my worry when playing the both of them. I mean, when it comes to keeping the ball, theres not many better, but they wont give you a whole lot of energy, which is why Schneiderlin has to start next to one of them, in my opinion.

20~~~
With Schneiderlin next to Carrick, it's too defensive still. With Schweinsteiger at least we look pretty creative and can pass it around quickly, but that goes away with Schneiderlin. Herrera is the key one IMO that has to partner them for it to work. He offers the creative, forward thinking from midfield that none of the others have along with having more energy and being quicker then the others.

21~~~
I agree, we should use Carrick/Herrera and Schneiderlin/Schweini as the partnerships if we want a good balance at the base of the midfield.

22~~~
I'd be over the moon if Herrera was played as the 8, but with Van Gaal wanting two defensive mids in front of thr back four, that's looking unlikely.

As for creativity,  I dont think Van Gaals massively bothered about his defensive midfielders being creative. Yes, they need to move the ball around quick and be able to switch play, but they first and foremost, need to be defensively capable. Creativity needs to come from the four ahead of the defensive mids, hence why he probably said he needs a 'Hazard type player'.

23~~~
might be dropped if the coach persists with 4-3-3 point forward. he is the best as the lone pivote, but that may not be used much this season

24~~~
Even if he's dropped, I still think he'll see plenty of playing time this season. There'll be teams when we probably do go Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger/Carrick, and even if we don't, Carrick will get some game time since it's unlikely that Schweinsteiger will manage to play every game - he'll feature regularly, but probably miss plenty.

25~~~
won't be, ever. surely LvG wants to experiment, he knows where the limit is though
the classic Alonso - Bastian conundrum which the whole world has warned about

26~~~
It'll be very rare, but I do think it's possible that we'll see that combo every so often, even if it's just when LVG wants us to comfortably control/see out a game.

27~~~
twitching arse predicted if so. teams can easily bombard that midfield and create chances

28~~~
Excellent. 97% pass completion.

29~~~
Class as usual. Looked a bit leggy in the second half, which I guess is why Van Gaal replaced him.

30~~~
Started sloppy along with the team. After the goal was very good and was pressing high.

31~~~
Surprised that he was advancing beyond Schneiderlin in the first half, solid tidy start.

32~~~
yeah. his freshness's the thing we need, plan ahead for the UCL game. also have Bastian now so it's easier to pull him out when suitable
 "one of the worst players, invisible" apparently

33~~~
it's a double pivot, so players take turn to advance

34~~~
Made some great intercetions as well. We really got back in the game once he started venturing forward, closing down players and cutting out passes. Played very intelligently, allowed Schneiderlin to do the running around and dirty work while he took up great positions and dictated the tempo of the game.

35~~~
Made some great interceptions, I was thinking it well done Schneiderlin but then saw multiple times it was Carrick. It will be interesting to see if he can remain our no 1 choice.

36~~~
yes when fit, I don't see problems with it

37~~~
Thought the same.  I'd like to see how many he made in the 1st half: seemed like several.

38~~~
Carrick made 4 interceptions, all in the first half. Schneiderlin made 3, one of which was in the first half.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2015/matches/803169/player-stats/2404/3_DEFENCE_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/2404/3_DEFENCE_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

The main difference between them in terms of stats was Schneiderlin's 5 fouls conceded and 5 successful tackles - Carrick no fouls and 1 successful tackle.

39~~~
Played well, but I don't like the way LVG is using him.

At his age, he should be able to sit back and control the game, with two runners proving the 'legs'. Not having to charge around in a 2 man midfield.

40~~~
I think we'll eventually see sense and revert to 433 with Carrick deepest.

41~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>CARRICK: NEW SIGNINGS CAN BRING SUCCESS</b></span>
<b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Michael-Carrick.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Carrick</a> is “desperate” to win trophies during his 10th season at Manchester United and the evergreen midfielder believes the club’s new signings will support that ambition.</b>

The Reds began the highly-anticipated 2015/16 season on Saturday with an important <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2015/Aug/Match-report-Manchester-United-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur</a> at Old Trafford, where Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian, Morgan Schneiderlin, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Memphis Depay all made their competitive debuts for the club.

Carrick gave an in-depth interview to the official matchday programme, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/programme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United Review</a>, to discuss his new team-mates, the fascinating battle for places in midfield, the club's famed youth policy and his recently-celebrated 34th birthday. 

<b>We have signed five new players this summer and quite a few have left the club as well. How does it feel in the squad after all that change? </b>
It has been pretty settled actually, all things considered. The new boys that have come in have settled very quickly and I think it helps that four of them were here before the tour. Being away in each other’s pockets every day, you get to know each other quickly. It’s a good squad, there is a good spirit among us and it is a really happy camp. We are looking to carry that on.

<b>As vice-captain, what role have you played in helping everyone settle in?</b>
You obviously get to know them, speak to them and make them feel comfortable but I think it is a general thing among our squad. It is a friendly bunch of lads and the boys have settled in quickly. One of the things, when you do have a new signing, is finding them a home, finding them an apartment, a house, and things like that. So I have just been helping them, telling them about the areas, the restaurants, where to go, where not to go and all that type of thing.  

<b>How much quality do your fellow central midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger add to the group, and have you been impressed by them so far?</b>
Well, we all know about them. Morgan has been at Southampton for a number of years and has been a very good player in the Premier League. Over the last three or four years, he has had some really great performances and we have all seen that. Basti is slightly different, he is new to England, but at the same time we all know exactly what he does and what he is all about. He has had an incredible career so far and he is going to have a big say in this team and this squad going forward. 

<b>Bastian seems to be settling particularly well - are the players tapping into his experience?</b>
He has achieved so much. It is like any new signing, the boys – not just myself – ask questions and you try to pick things up, how they have done things in their past experiences and try to learn from it. He has been at the very top. He is a World Cup-winning captain - what more can you ask for?

<b>Personally, are you relishing the competition for places in central midfield?</b>
Yeah, but it is what I have had since I have been at the club. It is what this club is all about, having competition for places and a strong squad. That is how it should be. We want to be challenging on all fronts. We want to be going for the Champions League, we want to be challenging for the league title and to do that you need a big squad, and strength in key areas. It is good that the club has made these key additions and given us a chance to have a good season.

<b>Having recently celebrated your 34th birthday, how do you feel physically?</b>
I feel good, 34 creeps up on you and time has gone quite quickly, but it is not something that bothers me. I just have to judge how I feel, how I am and how I am performing. At the moment, I feel good, I feel fit and I am just trying to do the right things, look after myself right and give myself the best chance of playing for longer. 

<b>How good are the other lads, Matteo Darmian and Memphis Depay?</b>
Yeah, I can speak for all of the new lads and say they’ve all done really well. With Memphis, you can see the ability he has got and obviously he is still learning the way we play and he is trying to fit in. But you can see instantly that there is real talent there. Matteo has been very impressive in training and in the games. He is doing really well, you can see what type of player he is and I am sure he’s going to have a good time here.

<b>The boss played a lot of young players on tour this summer. Did they catch your eye?</b>
I think they all did well. It was great to see that seven of the 11 that finished the Barcelona game came through the system. It is great to see in this day and age when there is so much<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Aug/Michael-Carrick-interview-part-two-from-United-Review.aspx#80460845" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>money around with signing big players, that it is still hugely important to have the young boys coming through. This club prides itself on that and it has done for many, many years. It is vital that it carries on. Certainly this year, the big part of the squad is home-grown and there is some real talent in there as well. They just need to develop and when they get their chance, they should take it.

<b>You’ve already won five league titles in your United career, but have the last two seasons made your hungrier for more success?</b>
I wouldn’t say hungrier, because every year when I have been here we have been desperate to win something and to win the league. That hasn't changed, whether we have won it or not, to be honest. Every season, we have started the same and gone again. Regardless of whether you won it or not, you start from scratch and go again. One thing we have always done when we have won something is look at the next one and I think that is a real strength in how we have achieved what we have. Having the two years, that is gone now. When we haven’t been serious contenders and challenging is frustrating. Now is the time for us to get right back up there.

42~~~
Bit sad that we went away from the one holding midfielder formation, Carrick was benefitting alot from having more time and space to do his thing, now he is further up and gets pressed alot.
Still think he will do good though, the 12/13 season isn't that long ago, and he almost single handedly carried our midfield from that same position.

With BFS to rotate with he will have a great season, still my favourite player here.

43~~~
he just made four interceptions, nothing to feel sad as long as he can be used reasonably

44~~~
Rather poor today I thought. Seemed to shy away from the ball.

45~~~
It's not unusual for him to start a season slowly.

46~~~
The change of formation seems to make different demands on Carrick, less time spent doing what he is good at, building moves and gaining possession through interceptions, and more time higher up the pitch, so far not really impacting the game at either end. When he tries to press high up the pitch, it just looks uncomfortable as he struggles to get there in time and has no chance of getting back to help the defence.

Perhaps the logic behind the new set-up is down to Carrick's age and trying not to rely on him.

47~~~
Yea seems in midfield with 2 holdings and number 10,he looks different (performance wise) compared with 1 with 2 CMs in front,seems he has similar issues like Matic when Mou switched to 2 holdings with Mikel in 2nd half of last season,after change Matic form dropped.

48~~~
This is precisely what I feel. He is little out of his comfort zone at this point and not every move is going through him. Hence, he is not able to stand out like seasons. Its better in the long term for him as well as the team. Arrival of Morgan and Bastian will hopefully benefit him as he is coming towards the twilight of his career.
We are not making the same mistake that we did while replacing Scholes.

49~~~
He was shit. He starts slowly all the time. He shouldn't be starting if that's the case/

50~~~
Same here, I think age and the likelihood that he's being phased out of a regular spot in the lineup are playing into this.  I don't think Carrick was that bad, he is really playing with half the freedom he used to in splitting the pitch with Schneiderlin.  The formation sucks for attacking purposes but at least we're not wetting ourselves every time the ball comes into our half.

51~~~
Does he always start slow every season? He seems a little different to me this time around. He doesn't affect the game or rather run the game like he used to previous seasons. I noticed that even in pre-season. Has his role drastically changed? And this is why I'm not a fan of him and Schneiderlin starting. I think they are similar players. We need Bastian starting so he can be that deeper lying playmaker alongside Schneiderlin.

52~~~
Fergie said he always start the season slow and takes him about a month to come into form so hopefully he's right.

53~~~
Extremely poor first half. Can't effect the game higher up the pitch and is misplacing too many passes.

54~~~
Sloppy again. It has long been a cliche that 'Michael Carrick starts slowly ' but he can't afford to with Bastian waiting. To be fair, Bastian is a level above anyway,  and I reckon the boss was just planning on showing some loyalty to a senior player who had served him well by having Carrick first choice at first.

55~~~
Would bring schweiny in for him.

56~~~
Except for his assist of course.

57~~~
More to do with fitness of Bastian I think. I do expect Bastian to be starting ahead of him for a part of the season once he's up to speed.

58~~~
It was a good pass, but he was caught out numerous times higher up the pitch just like in previous matches.

59~~~
Terrible game from him and not because of his own goal.

How many misplaced passes did he have? How many times did he charge off pressing the player with the ball leaving our midfield wide open with a simple pass by the pressured Brugge player? He looked like a naive 18 year old looking to impress someone. He usually has slow starts to his season. Maybe Schweini should take over starting duties?

60~~~
Maybe starting in two matches consecutively is something he cannot do anymore.

61~~~
Not mobile enough. He wasn't available to our defenders and his passing was off. Good that he went off

62~~~
He hasn't been the same midfielder we saw last season, perhaps age is just catching up to him.

63~~~
was undroppable last yr , first man off this.

64~~~
Thought again he was poor tonight generally with his play. Would much rather see Bastian in there.

65~~~
Carrick is 34 now? I've loved him more than most since day one but I wonder if Basti might phase him out this season leading to Carrick leaving the club next summer

Sad to think that may happen but every great player's career has to end with us at some point

66~~~
Surprised that he wasn't dropped for tonight. I think Bastian will start the next game though LVG is probably cautious with his injury record.

67~~~
He looks fine physically though his mental sharpness/concentration has been lacking. I think he's just a bit slow getting up to speed after the summer and will be hugely important for us this season still.

68~~~
Worrying about his form. After 3 games, he looked so lost. Having rough time  adapting the new role?
Luckily, we have Basti but still neither of them can play 2 games a week.

69~~~
You know he’s in poor form when he does that laser passing that only Mata in our team can control. The ball to Memphis was very creative and brave but kudos to Memphis for controlling that one, 9/10 would’ve lost it.

70~~~
He'll probabaly play less ..its a pity that both him and Bastian are over 30 as they would have worked as partnership in their younger days with one at 6 and another 8..now we need Schneiderlin's energy a lot...But he's not done..Hes adjusting

71~~~
As i've wrote before, i think he could have problems getting back to a 2 man midfield, the lone pivot role fits him better at this age where he has more time and space to do his thing.
Either way we will still have Bastian to rotate with him, so i'm not worried about this.

72~~~
Think he is at least 30% better when playing that solo DMC role in 3 man midfield with point back.

73~~~
Except for his assist he had a poor game. I don't think taking him off at half time was because he picked up a knock, I think it was tactical. He's been a good servant for us and vital to the way we have played at times over the years and it's a joke that he's not won more caps for England. I do however think this will be his last season for us and I would like to see Schweinsteiger get some starts rather than coming off the bench.

74~~~
It was tactical, Van Gaal confirmed it in a post match interview.

75~~~
He's the biggest casualty of the switch to 4-2-3-1 IMO, I think playing as a #6 with 2 #8's in front of him doing a lot of work was ideal, like how Juve used Pirlo in his twilight years.

76~~~
People probably disagree, but he's been much better than BFS. Spends much less time on the ball and closes down space better. Weirdly enough, he's been much more mobile as well.

Can only attribute it to Bastian not being completely fit yet.

77~~~
He's been good since coming on ahh.

Seems whoever starts gets sucked in to our slow tempo a little and whichever comes on has the automatic advantage of being able to inject pace into the side with quicker passing.

78~~~
Was very good when he came on

79~~~
Best midfield performance of the season.

80~~~
Great cameo Carrick!

81~~~
best 30minutes from him for a looong while. Perfect when we siege opponent on their half and around the box

82~~~
Did exactly what he was brought on for, even delivered one of our better crosses of the day.

83~~~
I do like this Schweinsteiger/Carrick rotation. When one of them comes on they always seem to boss the game.

84~~~
Our best player when he came on. Played some great passes that we should have done more with. It's good we're able to rotate him to allow him to come on and influence, hopefully next time though the attackers will show up.

85~~~
Yep. People are still in the honeymoon period with Bastian. He wasn't bad, but Carrick was a lot more incisive.

86~~~
Excellent when he came on, shame his shot didn't go in.

87~~~
Much better than BS. The competition between the two will be good for us.

88~~~
Was tailor made for him when he came on today. No pressure whatsoever on the ball and given the time to pick passes. Played some great balls.

89~~~
Superb when he come on. Just like people say Schweinsteiger comes on and controls the game, Carrick did that today. The penetrative passes he plays through the middle are a joy to watch. Unfortunately, our attacking players didn't do much with it.

90~~~
Much better performance today than on Tuesday, we upped the tempo of our game when he came on.

91~~~

92~~~
1st time in 4 games Carrick has looked better then BFS still should have been Herrera to come on don't need two dms at home to Newcastle

93~~~
Also the first time he's playing against opposition on 2nd half legs  with fresh legs and not the other way round though.

94~~~
Yeah, usually a slow starter Carrick. Looked more like his usual self on Saturday. Expect him to start midweek.

95~~~
Gone under the radar a bit...but he's had a really poor start to the season imo.

96~~~
He needs Schneiderlin next to him to cover the runner so he can concentrate on his passing.

97~~~
That he was pretty poor again tonight. Awful in the first half. We've definitely looked better defensively when Schneiderlin has played.

98~~~
Standard opening month from him. As Fergie once said, we'll see the real Michael Carrick once autumn kicks in. Such a nice change to have really quality cover when it's not quite happening for him.

99~~~
Thats a good point, I'd forgotten his tendency to have a slow start to the season. Its quite bizarre how it seems to happen every year.

Totally agree on the second point. Its probably the first time in at least 5 years where I feel comfortable without Carrick in the team. Its a great luxury, long overdue.

100~~~
This, exactly. It's great that we don't have to rely on him anymore - in 14/15, it was genuinely ridiculous how clueless our team looked the second he was out of the team, when we went from our best run of form to our worst (in the run in). Schweinsteiger will prove to be a magnificent signing for that reason alone, even if he doesn't show his form of old.

I still wouldn't bet against him being our best midfielder in the run-in, though. Every single year he is criticised for a bad start, and every single year he ends up as one of our most important players towards the end of the season. With every passing season he becomes less mobile, but it seems like his reading of the game and range of passing never stops improving. He's very different to the Carrick of a few years ago, but there is no one else in the squad who has the tools he has. 

Although he won't be playing every game anymore (and rightly so, as Schweinsteiger is the superior player), he still has so much to offer us. His experience will prove invaluable in a few months, especially if we advance in the CL.

101~~~
The new signings will make perform better since he'll be more rested.

102~~~
Even a poor performing Carrick is a joy to have on the bench if needed.

Honestly even before the season after our signings I wouldn't have him in the first XI.

103~~~
A "really poor start" is a bit OTT. Standard Carrick, takes a month or two to get into the groove but nothing overly alarming. 

We've had control of most games we've played and still the only midfielder who consistently plays accurate forward passes from deep areas. I just hope he can teach Schneiderlin how to pass through a team, because if he adds that to his defensive steel he'll be outstanding for us.

104~~~
So he didn't start and we lost the game, maybe he is our real talisman.

105~~~
Agree. He is the best at dictating the tempo and organizing our game, getting the better of the players around him, specially Schneiderlin.

Every time commander Carrick gets subbed off, the french start running around the whole pitch with no clear porpoise.

Right now, playing Sweinsteiger (for more than 25 minutes) is like playing with one less man, and his midfield partners suffers it the most. Slow slow slow and weak on the challenge... Hopefully he can regain some competitive level. Because moving his arms and pointing fingers around doesn't help much.

106~~~
probably the only ones who appreciate him fully are coaches and colleagues

107~~~
Manchester United's <b>Michael Carrick</b> withdraws from the England squad to play Switzerland on Wednesday because of injury.

FFS!! Just on BBC.... Hope nothing serious!!!

108~~~
Fantastic.

109~~~
Never fear Bastian is here.

110~~~
Literally (Jamie) the least surprising news you're likely to encounter all week.

Other then "England and Switzerland in borefest at the Stade de Suisse"

111~~~
Not injured, not injured, please not in- ....... Great.

112~~~
There are few things more predictable than a Michael Carrick injury on international duty. Hopefully it's more of a knock rather than anything serious. At least we have Bastian available...

113~~~
I just want to know how Phil Jones managed to make it into the England Camp?

114~~~
That's why we bought Bastian.

115~~~
Is he really? WTF is going on there then?

116~~~
He's not - just a bad joke about Phil Jones injuring our own players

117~~~
I think it's almost impossible to get through an international break without picking up at least one injury. 

At least we've got BFS.

118~~~
He does himself no favours with the England camp, to be honest. He may well be injured, but this has been a regular occurrence for a player seldom injured at club level over the years.

119~~~
<a class="username" data-user="56592, @Annihilate Now!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56592/">@Annihilate Now!</a> 
Should have realised <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

120~~~
He's not Phil Jones who always gets into risky situations. anything, shouldn't the blame lie somewhere else considering he hardly got injured here at United? yeah just blame him right

121~~~
I'm actually leaning more to him getting a touch of the Ryan Giggs syndrome when it comes to his international career. I've got nothing to back it up, just a bit of speculative thinking due to how regular this seems to happen.

I want him to play for England at the heart of the midfield three and pulling out of crucial matches makes that less likely to happen.

122~~~
he always played whenever coaches bothered to summon him, it's just an unfortunately crap situation.

123~~~
Well no, not really, that's my point. He has pulled out of the national squad on a few occasions now. And when Hodgson first took charge in 2012 he was told that Carrick was not in the frame for selection by the FA. Carrick's entire international career has been a massive let down but I can't help but feel he hasn't really helped himself, whether it be his actual performances when selected or pulling out of the squad on a regular basis.

124~~~
the first point though I don't personally agree, but I can understand if that's the perception of coaches. But I can't recall he purposefully pulled out regularly at all, other than the 2012 event

125~~~
I'm not saying it's on purpose, how would I know? I just don't think it creates a very good perception of Carrick and his drive to play for the national side. I think this might be the third time in the last couple of years he's pulled out of a squad.

126~~~
Is it a serious injury? 
Any news?

127~~~
It's unspecified. Personally I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a 'knock' as England already qualified so there's no use risking him. I'd much rather have Smalling come back in that scenario though.

128~~~
Please no! think he's got a big season in him.

129~~~
They have said on Talksport it is a calf injury and came out of nowhere.

130~~~
Very good so far. Probably our best player so far.

131~~~
Yep, great stuff, playing like a boss.

132~~~
must say that Liverpool midfield is hardly a challenge

133~~~
Been pleased with him so far. He's played some decent passes and has been one of our better player. Perhaps need to make more incisive passes along with Schweinsteiger if we're going to get a goal, but then it's pretty difficult to create much for the forwards when it's Fellaini you're passing to.

134~~~
he's been good but, we are playing too deep due to Carrick and Sweinsteigger being both too immobile to play a bit higher. You expect us to dominate the game in deep areas but there is absolutely lack of penetration. Poor movement upfront is one thing but lack of legs in midfield is another, Schneiderlin for one of Sweinsteiiger/carrick would bring more of b2b energy and movement in midfield so much needed in this game

135~~~
He was majestic, best midfielder on the pitch till he was substituted. A couple of great penetrating passes too.

136~~~
Underrated

137~~~
He showed signs today that he's still a top midfielder. He just needs to show it more now

138~~~
more likely the coach need manage his matches

139~~~
He needs to show that he's in top form and then he will play whenever fit enough. Simple

140~~~
he's 34, playing in a 2-man midfield twice a week is crazy times two to him, how can he show anything? when he is put to do what he specializes in like today, I won't doubt for a second he can still show the best.

141~~~
Imperious today. What a brilliant player.

142~~~
His best game of the season, on most days he'd have been the best CM on the pitch today.

143~~~
Was brilliant. Some absolute brilliant passes. Shame we were unable to capitalise on them but he really was great today.

144~~~
He's such a class act. Absolutely love the guy. Controlled the game today. Pressed really well too. Super!

145~~~
Excellent performance.

146~~~
Performance has been swept under the carpet a bit. That pass to Darmian in the first half was excellent.

147~~~
And to Herrea for the pen

148~~~
Best performance of season so far for me, done his job well and complimented Schweinsteiger beautifully, couple of lovely passes for Herrera and Darmian too.

149~~~
He is still great. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

I actually think van Gaal is saving him bit too much. Taking him off when he is clearly our best player on the pitch is bit harsh, but I won't complain if he stays injury free whole season with that kind of threatment and we have him 100% fit when we need him the most.

150~~~
I was very happy with his performance, particularly his passing where he was trying to penetrate which isnt always the case.

151~~~
Excellent game from him. Knew he'd be up for the big game. 

The way he intercepts and plays the ball out are really a joy to watch. 

I remember when I first saw him live, he was the player that impressed me the most.

152~~~
He's such a quality player. Pretty funny looking back to when I thought we had settled for 2nd place when we bought Carrick and Chelsea got Ballack.

153~~~
So good yesterday,one of the things I have regularly felt in the last 2 seasons is that Saf kind of wasted his peak years by giving him no support. Now I know wasted isn't probably the right word because we won a lot as a team but I think Carrick had to do so much in those years that we kind of missed out on a lot of his attacking assets

154~~~
I wish he wasn't 34 <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

155~~~
It's a crime that he only has 33 caps for England.

156~~~
He was usually the one to provide the forward impetus even back in those days. I thought SAF used him perfectly and that was one of the reason why we were so successful. Even on RvP season, he was the second best player on the team and was very important player for us.

157~~~
I'm appalled that this thread isn't full from how amazing he was yesterday.  His passing, calmness, intelligence on the ball was fantastic. Schneiderlin is going to have big shoes to fill.

158~~~
No doubt, the penalty Herrera won was half down to Carrick for that pass.

159~~~
I suspect that fans already expect that from him so this is the reason to lack of praise. He is really a classy midfielder.

160~~~
Its an absolute disgrace in all honesty.

Those comments a few months ago from Hodgson about Carrick being a good backup for Wilshire were an absolute joke too. I really wish he'd feck England off. They don't deserve him.

161~~~
Give it few more games for that Carrick - Basti - Morgan chemistry to work and we shall see our midfield in prime I am sure. Can't wait to see Carrick and Basti spraying jaw dropping passes. We have seen few glimpses of that

162~~~
oh don't touch England's next midfield gem (and the hype when he gives a feck about being fit to play)

163~~~
Very good game from him. He and schweinsteiger still need fine tuning but seem a good pair. Wish they were both 5 tears younger.

164~~~
Vision 79 Positioning 61...

165~~~
FIFA...

166~~~
I somehow missed that. My goodness <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

167~~~
Still our best passer of the ball. I thought Bastian might rival him (and he has to be fair) but Carrick just edges it in the passing stakes.

168~~~
Yeah those computer game scouts etc really are credible sources....

169~~~
He was class this weekend, he is an incredible passer, has a great vision, a great positioning and he had a lot of energy.

170~~~
yet I've still heard questions like "If he is as good as the hype, why is he only rated 79 on FIFA? It must mean something"

171~~~
He said something along the lines of Carrick being able to 'do a job' while Wilshire is out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

172~~~
The pass for Herrera's penalty was a thing of beauty. 

He's the complete opposite of the so called quality English midfielder. No blood and thunder, no last ditch tackles, not even any goals and no media hype. He just subtly dominates and screens the back four while keeping things ticking and getting the team forward.

173~~~
Is Michael fit for this evening. Was unsure with him being taken off against Liverpool

174~~~
Honestly hope he dosnt play against PSV, a 34 year old midfielder should never play two games a week

175~~~
Thing is I think Bastian needs a rest as well playing 90 minutes for Germany and then 90 minutes against Liverpool. Schneiderlin nailed onto start I would have thought but one of the 2 elderly statesmen will have to as well.

176~~~
Bit of a pickle that. We could make the revolutionary move of only playing one holding mid? But that's off topic.

LVG obviously will be keeping his players fitness in mind, I guess we will have to trust his lineups

177~~~
Yeh. It's Bastian that need rest. He's played a lot over the past 10 days.

178~~~
Offtopic but that's misleading. Positioning is referring to "Attacking Positioning" which is obviously low for a CDM while an attacker like Müller has 94. The defensive part of positioning is covered with Interception, where Carrick has 86, so that's quite fair I'd say.
Vision should definitely be in the 80s that's true.

179~~~
We missed our talisman again, no Carrick no win.

180~~~
It's getting weird at this stage. We seemingly never win or play particularly well without him.

181~~~
Still our best CM at 34...

182~~~
He is way more direct than any of our other players, even though he sits Deep he tries passes between the lines getting it fast forward to our players or move the ball fast with a long range pass, because he can.

Also his defensive Work is quite good, he just does it very discretly closing Down passing options and intercepting in a calm manner.

Generally, he just adds much more calmness to our play, a real Deep-lying playmaker.

183~~~
Should have come on for Mata imo. Thought it was the most obvious sub once Fellaini came on and wasnt having an affect on the game. Then push Fellaini and Martial up top, and have Young and Memphis out wide crossing.

184~~~
I get that. He's my favourite player pretty much. It still just seems mental that one player however good can have that much say in our results. Surely the team should at least be able to function without him. He wont be around much longer

185~~~
Yeah i know, we shouldn't be dependent upon him, but looking at the stats from last season and this it seems like there is a connection. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

186~~~
We lose less games with him on the pitch. This is a fact.

I wonder if Blind could switch to LB and Carrick drop to CB.

187~~~
No Carrick. No Party.

188~~~
I thought we might end the game that way since we had so much possession, with Smalling coming off. 

That said, I think we need Carrick to be rotating with Schweinsteiger, assuming the German needs rest to not get hurt again, though that might be nonsense. I'm not a doctor.

189~~~
Missed him big time yesterday. I mean, the amount of times Martial was showing for feet and no one give it him was madness. The few times he did get it, he linked the play well and we looked pretty dangerous. Can't help but think we'd have been a lot more threatening positions had Carrick been on the pitch to ping some passes into him.

190~~~
anyone else surprised this thread only has 5 pages?

191~~~
Not really, its always the same with Carrick. Has a good match and gets 10 posts, meanwhile Schweinsteiger will get over 10 pages. He just isn't cool enough to post about.

192~~~
Carrick's pass to Herrera for the penalty against Livershit and Schweinsteiger's pass to Mata (where Mata fecked up) against PSV were really good.

193~~~
"familiarity breeds contempt"

194~~~
Fun fact:

8 games played
5 games with Carrick in starting line-up = 5 games won = 100% win rate
3 games without Carrick in starting line-up = 0 games won = 0% win rate

Co-incidence, lucky charm or curses?

195~~~
That's been going on for so long that it can't be a coincidence. We're a completely different team with him in it.

196~~~
But he did come on as a substitute in two of them? Anyway he is a very important player for us.

197~~~
He has to be in the starting line-up. Feels like a curse if he is not there then no matter how well we play we will not win, e.g. Newcastle and PSV. Even if you sub him on it is too late as you have angry the gods.

198~~~
This significantly reduced win % without him in the team has been going on too long to be down to coincidence, but at 34 he simply cannot play every three days. We need to find a way to win without him.

I wonder if in the games he doesn't start, we should go back to a midfield three of Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Herrera together because any pairing, without Carrick, just doesn't seem to have an optimal balance.

199~~~
True.

200~~~
Very true.

Schweinsteiger has one good game and everyone goes over the moon "OH YES CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S PLAYING FOR US BFS!!"

Carrick has a good game and it's like "Decent game, but needs to do more though passes"

201~~~
Our dependency as a club on Carrick is scary.

I thought signing BFS would be the answer to this dilemma. Its early days I guess, hopefully the German starts influencing games more soon (not that he has been bad)

202~~~
Needs to play alongside a more box to box player, him and Schneiderlin just doesn't work.

Southampton know they can just man mark Rooney because neither of our CMs are going to venture forwards whatsoever.

203~~~
He's been poor for the majority of our opening games. Disappointing so far today again.

204~~~
He's been much better then Carrick has so far.

205~~~
Southampton pressing so Carrick goes into hiding, he isn't offering himself up for the ball at all.

206~~~
I don't feel this system suits him. Carrick has always excelled when he is the sole holding midfielder, like last season when he had Herrera and Fellaini were ahead of him.

In a duo like this, at least one of the CMs needs to get forwards and support the attack.

Gary Neville is talking about it now.

207~~~
He has been hiding like a coward today.

208~~~
Needs to wake the feck up. But then again, old habits die hard (taking 3-4 months to get into form).

209~~~
Not just not offering. He is shielding himself behind Soton players, much like how Anderson did with us. Absolutely embarrassing how someone like Carrick shows such lack of gumption.

There was a period of about 5-7 mins after he dallied on the ball for ages before pasisng to Smalling who immediately gave it away under pressure and Pelle hit the bar. I followed Carrick's movements and he just kept hiding behind Soton players. Disgusting. Anyone can have a bad game, but this lack of balls but such an experienced player does my head in. Shows the difference in quality betweme BFS and Carrick.

210~~~
One of those days when he's not thinking quick enough. Not stamping his usual authority

211~~~
His biggest weakness has always been keeping the ball when pressed. If Van Gaal did his research he'd have started Schweinsteiger against a team like So'ton.

212~~~
Shouldn't be played in a <a class="username" data-user="68529, @2 Man Midfield" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68529/">@2 Man Midfield</a> against teams that press as much as Southampton. Especially with Schneiderlin who doesn't really make himself available for the ball as much as Herrera or Schweinsteiger do.

213~~~
He's been poor whenever he's started this season. Coming off the bench he's made a few good passes.

214~~~
Needs to be replaced by Schweinsteiger, BFS will look to play further forward and look to take ball into feed higher up the field as well.

215~~~
I agree. Being our midfield senior he has to get hold of the game. Disappointing how overrun we have been in midfield today.

216~~~
It is fine to be not great under pressure but he literally hid behind Soton players. Embarrassing from someone with his experience and caliber.

217~~~
He starting to look his age, his touch seems to be deserting him slightly and he gives the ball away a lot more than before.

218~~~
He can't play next to Morgan... simple as that. They don't complement each other as midfielders at all.

219~~~
Not true, he was grand against Liverpool.

220~~~
Everyone was decent in the second half. But Schweinsteiger bossed the midfield that game.

221~~~
Presumably because when he did show for the ball he was quickly dispossessed due to their heavy pressure.

222~~~
He was decent in the first half too, it was everyone infront of him and Bastian that were bollocks.

223~~~
Then he needs to be taken off immediately. If your senior midfielder cannot take responsibility to receive a pass, it would be better to play without him.

224~~~
No matter how bad we play, if carrick starts we win. Own goal, backpass mistake or whatever we will win. Let's see how long this last. Still keeping his 100% win record.

225~~~
Schneiderlin and him represent our most offensively timid combination.

226~~~
Looked off the pace throughout. Not sure the 2 holding midfielders system suits Carrick. He doesn't have the pace to get back now he is positioned slightly higher up the pitch.

227~~~
He is far better in a withdrawan 3 man midfield role with two ahead of him in a possession-oriented system. I don't like seeing Schneiderlin sitting with Carrick tasked with moving around, it's strange.  

Even still, I think when it comes to playing the ball forward into dangerous players he's our best passer of the ball. He'll come good as always.

228~~~
meh

229~~~
Him and Schneiderlin basically get in each others way I think

230~~~
He's in that Pirlo phase where he is best when playing in a proper midfield 3 at the base with two doing the running, almost like a Quarterback in the pocket. In the double pivot there is too much grass to cover for him IMO and it's made worse when he's in their with Schneiderlin as they play square of each other and he has no out ball.

231~~~
Well, he does tend to start the season slowly. So hopefully he'll improve. With that being said Southampton were very good at pressing Blind and him for the first half and hour or so.

232~~~
Funny, he was naff, and couldn't in any way, shape or form, be credited much with us winning the game... and yet:

Carrick started, and we won the game.

It's like a feckin' hoodoo or something

233~~~
I think we've seen enough now to assume that Carrick and a two man midfield role isn't working. Particularly when Van Gaal has given him the job of stepping into attacking areas of the pitch.

If we were to play with one holding midfielder then we'd get more out of him. Right now, given the new set up, the best place for Carrick is the bench, cover for Schweinsteiger.

234~~~
Yeah, pretty much. They both seem to play better without the other one on the pitch.

235~~~
He's not had a good start to the season, when Schweinsteiger came on he controlled the game in the middle much better than Carrick did. He hid away for most of the time he was on the pitch and he misplaced a fair few passes one of which nearly led to a Southampton goal.

236~~~
Think just like some other players,he is way better in < then in > formation.

237~~~
Thank god we have enough options in midfield. He isn't looking the same as he has done the previous two seasons.

238~~~
I think the criticism is harsh, he was magnificent vs Liverpool and hasn't been all that bad otherwise. I would love to see the Liverpool team again but with an inverted midfield:

-----Carrick-----
Herrera-Schweini

I feel Herrera is best box-to-box, while Carrick can concentrate on his long passing and will always have willing options for short passes with those 2 in midfield.

239~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1WxIDmv-Ak?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

What a player he can be I believe if we had 1 winger on better form, and a proper midfielder beside Carrick, we would have gone the distance in the 12/13 CL.

240~~~
I think the combination doesn't work for quite a few reasons. Firstly, schneiderlin sitting deeper than Carrick just doesn't make sense. Carrick has to be the deepest mid. They both end up looking like they want to be in schneiderlin's place when they play together. 

Why schneiderlin + BFS or Carrick + BFS works is because BFS is extremely comfortably playing high up the pitch with the ball. Neither of Carrick and schneiderlin can do that.

241~~~
Carrick is 33 now. If anyone thinks he can sustain a high level of performance they're kidding themselves.

242~~~
Why not?.

243~~~
Neither look as comfortable in the advanced positions as they look while they are sitting deep. Carrick for all his passing ability just doesn't seem willing to move up the pitch while playing 1-2s and stitching moves together. Much happier sitting deep.

244~~~
Carrick is not a pressing defender, he's a zone "wait and see" defender. (When he is defending static and in transition) That is pretty much why they don't work, for it two work you need similar players who are expert at pressing. For all Carrick's passing qualities he can't defend one on one to a man for toffee. Stick him in a zone or in transition and he always looks to clog the lanes instead of pressing. That is pretty much why they look like they get in each others way as well.

Also when we transition from winning the ball Carrick almost never offers a quick one two. He just gets it and looks for a medium range pass almost always. A few times MS has played a quick one two only to be bypassed and be miles ahead of the position only to either stop and have to slow himself down or just join the attack leaving Carrick alone.

The guy is 34 and on his last legs, not that he had very mobile legs even in the last 5 years.

245~~~
I don't agree with that. The way Carrick and schneiderlin defend are very contrasting obviously as you pointed out but it can definitely work well together. The problem I believe lies in who should be deeper. A presser + an interceptor looks a good combo. 

I agree with the 2nd bit more or less. That's what I said is the difference between BFS and Carrick. Carrick always looks to play the medium to longer range pass when he can.

246~~~
Yeah, that is Carricks thing, look up and snap a quick fire ball no matter what.

In a 4-3-3 yeah, but not in a 4-2-3-1. The presser just gets bogged down by the lack of pressing from the other guy which is what we are seeing. Then the 10 plays like a second striker and offers little help in transition.

247~~~
We should be looking for a replacement for him and BFS though, someone much younger..not necessarily for signing them next season, but just keep tabs on one..this kind of player is hard to find..a dictator of sorts.

248~~~
Yeah, the gap being created due to both of them sitting that deep is quite ridiculous. Rooney being shite compounded that problem.

249~~~
If Schniederlin had Carrick's level of snap judgement passing then he'd be an absolute god of a player. These perfect 10's all-round players just don't exist, sadly.

Rooney hasn't been that shite in my opinion, all of the people who've tried to play 10 have different problems that completely negate their ability in the role. Depay and Januzaj had no clue what they were doing and where they were supposed to be. Mata plays with his back to goal for some reason and Rooney just isn't that creative, despite being more positionally disciplined. 

Some sort of balance has to be struck somewhere. It seems like a system where you push one rod in and another pops out somewhere.

250~~~
I think our most dominant midfield performance was vs Liverpool, and he was at the heart of it. Reports of his death are greatly exaggerated, he is still the best CM at the club at interceptions, aerially, and at long passing. His game requires fitness but not physicality, I think if used cleverly he can be used for a season or 2 more.

251~~~
Goss from the U21 seems promising. If and when Strootman finally gets over his injury woes I'd like him to replace Carrick. As for Bastian we already have Herrera and I think eventually Pereira will develop into that type of CM.

252~~~
You can never be too sure how youth players turn out, especially with us as we havent really produced a mainstay in the first team for almost 20 years now. 

As for Strootman, he's just had a third knee surgery, its not looking good at all for him.

253~~~
Maybe he is playing to instruction?

254~~~
Mata or Herrera should be the 10.

Possible but why would BFS be allowed to do it while Carrick is not when they were playing the same role?

255~~~
Yeah fair play on Herrera, he doesn't look right playing there imo, though but he probably is the best option.

256~~~
We just look stagnant with him in the team in a midfield two.

257~~~
The problem is exacerbated by him playing with Schneiderlin who also doesn't make himself available for the pass.

It should be Carrick or Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger or Herrera.

258~~~
A lot of focus on Rooney's poor play this season, but Carrick has arguably been just as poor at times.

259~~~
We need to buy a youngish play-dictating midfielder soon. Carrick isn't really upto it anymore and Schweinsteiger can't play every game.

260~~~
Worst player on the pitch in the first half, if we don't count Rooney. Had a really shit season so far.

261~~~
His passing has been uncharacteristically poor. He's generally not been convincing this season, for me he should be fourth-choice midfielder. Schneiderlin does the defensive part better, Schweinsteiger has more authority and creativity in terms of controlling the game, and Herrera has energy, drive and attacking verve. Carrick looks slow and average these days.

262~~~
Needs to get back to last seasons form... Probably will around November time but he's always poor in August/September

263~~~
I wonder if at his age he's struggling to find form without playing game after game, Scholes was said to be like that and didn't like rotation.

264~~~
Carrick always started seasons like this. You could obviously be right, but I think he's going to improve.

265~~~
I think some of the reason to his average performances is that we wen't with a double pivot midfield, he doesn't have the legs anymore, never been the biggest runner but now it is very visible.

266~~~
We go through this every year with him.

267~~~
Gundogan would be perfect. 


Like I said last week. Carrick off the bench has been very good. But he hasn't been great when he's started.

268~~~
Came on against Hoffenheim midweek and was truly brilliant. Dictated everything, demanded the ball, held on to it just enough to allow for runs and then played great ball after great ball. Scholes would have been proud of the performance.

269~~~
I'm not sure why he's been so tentative this season. We have our best midfiled in a long time which i thought would elevate Carrick's performances but alas it hasn't happened. Will the real Michael Carrick please stand up?

270~~~
Not sure how Carrick's getting all the stick and yet people are saying Schneiderlin was good... they were both as bad as each other in the first half, with Morgan being the worse of the two for me.

271~~~
We really need to start looking at replacing him. He will be 35 by the start of next season.

272~~~
Agreed. To call Schneiderlin's use of the ball uncreative would be an understatement. 

The issue I saw was that Carrick and Schneiderlin are both holding players. They both sit deep and like to operate in the same areas. Playing them together, especially against a team as poor as Sunderland, was overkill. Whenever they looked up there was nobody in the #8 role to shuttle the ball to, and they either had to go long or recycle the ball backwards. 

It would help both Carrick and Schneiderlin if, generally, they were rotated with one another not paired with one another.

273~~~
Think a lot of people have a misunderstanding of what the Carrick and Schneiderlin midfield partenership does.

Seems a strong expectation for both to create things from deep and a lack of appreciation for the defensive wall and solidity they offer.

Their primary function is to ensure structure is in place to benefit our attacking players and release them from a fair chunk of their defensive duties. Did they do that today? Completely.

Creativity comes from Mata, Memphis and Rooney primarily with full backs and this partnership thereafter. Given how little Rooney moves in the first half, that leaves longer, riskier passes toward Memphis, Martial and Mata to create. In order to do that, that's asking for trouble in Van Gaal's philosophy if it's attempted and failed repeatedly. Outcome; ball possession is safer.

Bastian and Herrera are the ones to expect creativity from. Schneiderlin and Carrick are defensive blocks, though each in different ways, Carrick positionally with Schneiderlin relying on energy more.

The sooner this is accepted and the less we expect something that is not their primary function, the better.

With Carrick we win more often than not. Coincidence? No. Appreciated? Somehow still not fully.

274~~~
This, I've said this since preseason. I don't understand what LVG is thinking when he puts out his CM pairing. Either he plays Bastian + Herrera which is too attacking and leaves us exposed at the back or he plays Carrick + Morgan which is too defensive and lacks Penetration upfront. We need 1 player from each pairing to play together. For example Bastian + Carrick against Liverpool was perfect, you couldn't ask anymore from your CM.

275~~~
I can't agree with that, Carrick was worse for me this game, our worst player, actually, with Rooney turning it around in the second half. Schneiderlin ended up having a good game, imo. Michael was also crap in the Saints game, but in that game Schneiderlin was also shit.

He had a really poor season so far, only good game I can remember from him is the Liverpool game. He usually is very consistent, I don't know what happened to him this season.

276~~~
He's always been a slow starter but I just wonder if relies on playing regularly in order to find his form, plus he's heading towards 35 so it's not impossible that his legs just aren't suited to the double pivot role like they were to the system we played last season.

277~~~
The only player that could complement Carrick is Herrera and they haven't been played together even once. Bastien would have been fine alongside Carrick five years ago and Schneiderlin, unfortunately, is too limited on the ball to affect play in an offensive sense. Given the number of games we have this season we should have Carrick - Herrera and Schmidfield as two distinct midfield partnerships for rotation purposes. In enables us to keep players fresh.

278~~~
Definitely had better games than the one yesterday. Hoping to see him and Schweinsteiger against Wolfsburg.

279~~~
I have no idea why he has rating of only 5.9 on here. He's been very good for most of the season when played. I can only assume people are getting giddy about our new toys in Bastian and Morgan, both of whom seem to be getting over the top praise.

280~~~
I don't think he's been very good when played but I agree with the last sentence. I think Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger have both been better but the difference is not as big as the ratings suggest.

281~~~
Stream I was watching made a point of Rooney dropping too deep. I feel that had more to do with the fact that Morgan and Carrick wanted to remain deep and kinda play the same role. Bastian moves it forward better.

282~~~
Yeah Schneiderlin ended up having a good game thanks to his second half, but Carrick was also much better in the second half as - as a team - we were pressing them harder to win the ball back when we lost it, and moving the ball a lot quicker in possession.

I can't see how anyone can look at that first half and say that Schneiderlin was better then Carrick though - as he was the main reason our play was really slow and turgid at times. He'd pick the ball up at the base in midfield in a shit load of space, spend way too long on the ball and then do nothing with it. He refused to dribble into the space afforded in front of him (not that Carrick does dribble into space either, but his passing is so much quicker and decisive that he doesn't have too) and kept dallying on the ball for way too long.

Yesterday was actually the first time when these two played together that there was a bit more space between them - with Carrick trying to push further up the park, but Schniederlin's range and tempo of passing wasn't good enough to dictate the play. It's why he's so much better with Herrera or Schweinsteiger... because he can pass the ball short to them and they can carry it away from him. (where as Carrick won't carry it, he'll just play a another pass).

As I said, second half he was much better, but first half he was very poor, along with Carrick.

I can see why Bastian is ahead, because he does more flashy things and his presence has impacted games somewhat when he's come off the bench... but agree completely on Schneiderlin. I mean just look at their threads after yesterdays game... As per my reply to the post above, I can't see how anyone could watch that first half and say Morgan had a better half of football then Michael.

283~~~
People are definitely goig over the top with Morgan, if he played like this for City or Chelsea people would be calling him average or decent, nothing more. He didn't really have one standout game so far, Carrick had actually few performances that were better than anything Schneiderling has provided so far.

284~~~
I must be missing something in games because I just dont see this "Carrick was awful" thing thats doing the rounds.

285~~~
Is Carrick meant to be shielding our back 4? He might as well not even be on the pitch, Arsenal are continuously getting free run at our defense.

286~~~
This is like Ferdinands final season, just an absolute liability.

287~~~
Michael Carrick isn't good for these games. High energy team? Carrick's fecked.

288~~~
He's really not been doing his job this match at either end of the pitch.

289~~~
Can't believe the defense is getting pretty much ALL the criticism, they've been shit but Carrick has been beyond terrible, positionally awful and so, so easy to by pass.

290~~~
He's been left, entirely by himself, to deal with an Arsenal (ARSENAL!) midfield, as Schweinsteiger has decided he's playing every position on the pitch apart from central midfield.

And then he's been crap on top of that.

291~~~
Cazorla has been helping Bellerin. Carrick has literally not helped Darmian.

292~~~
He's done as a top player I think. Just hasn't looked the same this year, which is understandable with his age.

293~~~
I tend to say this for years, both him and Sweinsteigger are great players individually but both struggle to play against high pressing opposition let alone playing together and with someone like Rooney... Off the ball play is fecking disastrous, they're not available for a pass neither they catch opposition players when they counter, add Rooney to that and we are really laughable in that midfield.. they've been absolutely thrashed by Coquelin and Cazorla..

This goes to Van Gaal, he decided to play this set-up even all the caf knew it doesn't work..

294~~~
Is he even playing?

295~~~
I don't think he has the legs anymore for this 2 man double pivot system, he needs that full protection of a proper midfield three like we played last season. Obviously he's not helped by Schweini going walkabout and Rooney doing nothing, but still, I think he's struggled with this switch in system more than most.

296~~~
Far too slow to be a starting XI player for us. He's not the only one who's guilty of this (not Mata before you think that) but it's not going to work going forward with a player like that in the middle.

297~~~
Carrick, Bastian, Fellaini with Rooney and Mata on the flanks is possibly the slowest midfield I've ever seen in football. Its a shame we don't have a 35 year old Gaz and Irwin on rear flanks, Bruce and Blanc as CB and Berbatov upfront

298~~~
fecking shocking performance tbh.

299~~~
Horrendous. Looked completely off pace and couldn't place a ball to save his life.

300~~~
Like against Southampton, his passing and decision making are pretty bad at the moment.

301~~~
We've known about this since the CL final against Barcelona in 2009. If he faces a highly energetic midfield, he's absolutely useless.

He's a class player if you give him time and space but that's a luxury in most big games. Needs to move on or possibly retire.

302~~~
MLS

303~~~
I prefer him coming on in the 60th minute. He is 34 now and has been extremely overworked since 2011.

304~~~
As sad as it is but he is done.

305~~~
The biggest victim of the switch to the double pivot IMO and even his passing was poor today.

306~~~
He, like Rooney, played not well enough to start games so far. He needs to be replaced properly in summer

307~~~
Completely overrun in the first 30 mins. Some good passes in the second half

308~~~
Worst I've ever seen him for United, 1/10 stuff. Just did <i>nothing</i> of any relevance to the game.

309~~~
Really looked out of sorts today.  Too slow with his movement and his thinking.  Gonna need replacing this summer.

310~~~
Worst I've seen him play. Worse than he was in the Moyes era. Can't get a pass right to save his life.

311~~~
Still can't get over just how bad he was.Absolute disaster

312~~~
He just hasn't been himself at all this season. Perhaps it's the lack of a 3 man midfield that's hurting him, because he was excellent last season.

313~~~
I can't remember Carrick playing well since before Fergie left, if I'm honest. He was important last year because we had no one else, but he was average at best when he played. Had a couple of decent games against Spurs and Liverpool but that was it. 

He is also 34 so can't be playing against Arsenal unless he's not the holding player. Not sure what Van Gaal was expecting there.

314~~~
Don't think he suits this double pivot 4-2-3-1.

He'd look better as the #6 in front of the CB's in a 433.


Problem is Bastian would also look at his best in that position.

315~~~
This is why it was correct to go for a player like Schneiderlin last summer. He hasnt hit the ground running but I'm confident he'll come good and we'd be in huge trouble till christmas if we had to rely on Carrick every week

316~~~
Even when he isn't being particularly effective in possession (probably people's biggest gripe with him) he reads the game and tackles well. Perhaps most importantly he has the mobility to somewhat counteract teams who look to break with pace, there's no way we would've been 3 down inside 20 minutes if Schneiderlin started in Carrick's place yesterday.

It's fine to place Carrick as the defensive midfielder in games where we struggle to break teams down but he shouldn't be an option there against the top sides.

317~~~
This <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We're heading in the right direction with injecting pace into our squad (Shaw, Martial, Memphis, Schneiderlin (for a CM he's decent) etc.), but compared to alot of the top teams, we do lack pace, especially with that lineup yesterday.

318~~~
Carrick injured?

319~~~
I'm not sure the coming on for the last 20 minutes role suits him as he tends to take time to warm up and work his way into a game.

320~~~
He's got to accept a squad role now as hes rightfully behind Schneiderlin, Herrera and Schweinsteiger in the pecking order, he's a good player to come out and see out a game of start for us in place of Schneiderlin against slower midfields who sit back.

321~~~
He's 34. Have a feeling it's his last season with us. I think we will invest in another midfielder which will cut off his game time.

322~~~
Oh I think he accepts the role I just don't feel it suits him as he tends to need time to feel his way into the pace of a game.

323~~~
He might've really been injured in the international break. I think he's been good so far this season in 30 min sub role.

324~~~
Based on his form and performances so far, this is the role he should currently play. I think we will replace him next summer

325~~~
Next year he is 35 and should head somewhere else where his skills will be used better. I could still see him having 1 or 2 good seasons for clubs like Juventus or Roma, but maybe he will choose the safe option and head to USA.

326~~~
Think Basti and Morgan are our best pairing by some distance. I also think this should be his last season with us.  He is still a terrific player but I think there is a limit to how you can press higher up the pitch with him in the side.

327~~~
Exactly. At this stage of his career it is vital for him that he plays behind two hard working midfielders.

328~~~
As much as I prefer all other midfield combinations without Carrick. I think he's still valuable to the team, when he's used like this, being fresh playing every third game aginst lesser oppositions. So one year extension wouldn't be bad, at the same time, he's already replaced with Basti so we could give chance to some youth players like Pearson/Goss/TFM for that position...

329~~~
If we were playing one of the big 3 in Europe I think we'd have to seriously think about Herrera out left, Martial up top, Mata out right and Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin in front of Carrick.

Wouldn't trust Young to do much against the elite teams and those are pretty clearly our 6 best midfielders + attackers.

330~~~
Last season Carrick benefitted from playing in a midfield three with Herrera and Fellaini. They provided the legs, energy and tempo and allowed Carrick to get on with controlling our game with his passing, whilst not having to cover the amount of ground that he inevitably does in a midfield two. 

Carrick and Bastian might both be fantastic, classy players but it's not hard to see how a midfield of the two of them together might lack a bit of pace and energy in midfield, compared to a trio with Schneiderlin, Herrera or Fellaini. 

I don't think Carrick is done at all, he just needs to be used correctly. Even in our current formation he'd look better with Herrera at number ten as he contributes more in midfield. I don't really mind which one of Carrick/Schweinsteiger start for us as long as it's not both on a midfield two. They both have a lot to give this season and with all the games we have, and the right amount of rotation, age doesn't have to be an issue at all.

331~~~
Not looking good for him is it? He seems to have really dropped down the pecking order.

332~~~
Yep doesn't look good thought he would play today after not making an appearance during the week.

333~~~
He's been quite poor this season though, no vice-captain privileges for him it appears.

334~~~
Is this the end of Michael Carrick? Yes definitely it is. He's fecking zombie, as a captain he should impose himself much more in the game, he looks like he played 270 minutes yesterday. This is not fecking 80s and this is not at all captains performance, Fellaini's ot helping being another zombie but this is just unacceptable.. 

I was actually looking forward to seeing him this game as he should have been fresh and ready to fight Basti back  but it seems like he lost any kind of motivation...

335~~~
Meh so far.

336~~~
I'm reminded of Schneiderlin at the weekend who was looking for space to pick the ball up off his centre backs, actively looking to impose himself on the midfield. All of which Carrick is failing to do, against Middlesbrough.

337~~~
He's hiding against a Championship Middlesbrough.

338~~~
Not seeking the ball enough. Very disappointing.

I think Carrick like Rooney are finished at the top level.

339~~~
He's cooked. To be fair, even at his best he's slow as feck but at the moment, he's like a pensioner out there.

340~~~
Think he was fine and was trying to pass forward mostly.

341~~~
He's been so poor, he's just doing nothing, it's the safe pass every time - and people want him to start in the premier league.

342~~~
Agreed. He had a good 2nd half, passing has been good and he's picking out players between the lines. 

Looking tired now, just been caught in possession

343~~~
Dear god you have low standards.

344~~~
Caps off a fine performance.

345~~~
Done.

346~~~
no reason to keep him in the team, he never had any kind of leadership in him, never liked this calm captains... that only shows lack of leaders in our team...

347~~~
He really is finished at the highest level.

348~~~
He's never struck me as a confident penalty taker. I think he felt obliged as one of the senior players.

349~~~
What do you Guys expect of him? Admittedly i have a soft spot for Carrick, but i think some of you are being a bit unfair.

350~~~
To act and play like the most experienced player on the pitch?

351~~~
I expected him to boss a game like that, Fellaini covered plenty of ground next to him but he just seemed disinterested in really trying to lead the team and dictate things.

352~~~
He controlled our play and was making forward passes, alot of the time our attacking players couldn't controll the ball which aren't exactly Carrick's fault.
This is his role, he isn't a box-to-box midfielder, he sits Deep and control from there.

353~~~
Controlled our play? For the first 45 he hid behind the Boro' striker and left it all to Pereira. The rest of the game was marginally better but still a shambles of a performance. 

I know exactly what his role is, but it's safe to say he had no interest in doing it.

354~~~
No need to further discuss then, we watched a different game.

355~~~
fecking hell, watch again the first half, he was asleep lacking any kind of motivation, we neede to lift from a player like him, he also had an armband ffs... he played like he went to school and next day after a marathon... second half was better some good penetrating passes when it opened and he got hairdried most of all people but overall he's done at top level. Player who can't run with the ball and even without in modern game is just fecking useless no matter how good he's with his passing, when he's got no time on it... I hope we are ruthless in the summer. We already replaced him with Sweinsteigger, thevacant place can go to TFM/Pearson if they are up to it..

EDIT: It looks like you alone watched different game..

356~~~
Shocking this season really. Still think he'll go on a good run soon enough though as he always does. Awful pen though.

357~~~
Pirlo, Busquets, alonso and xavi say hi!

358~~~
Xavi skins players left right and centre! The other three are also a lot more nimble than Carrick, bar maybe Alonso.

359~~~
And Scholes post retirement?

360~~~
You could be right on that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

361~~~
all these players have always had much better movement  or dribbling than Carrick, how can they say hi? Carrick's been definitely one of the slowest player who ever played for United. It's not a coincidence that after Scholes came out of reitrement bossed it again at 37 while carrickbeing at his peaked hide in his shadow. Our midfield has been also underwhelming when Carrick was our best mdifielder. Now we have Herrera/schneiderlin, Sweinsteigger and one can say it's quite a difference, we have a midfield, don't you think?

362~~~
None of them ran much with or without the ball which is what the post was about.

363~~~
Those players are slow with and without the ball though which is what I was contending. Sure, they (apart from Alonso) can manipulate the ball in tight spaces significantly better than carrick.  

When our midfield was underwhelming when he was the best midfielder that wasn't at all his fault. Did you see the sods he ways playing with there?

364~~~
Reminds me of his performances under Moyes. I don't believe that in the last few months he's lost the ability to play at the top level at all. He was great as a methodical player not someone who relied on pace or sharpness. 

A combination of bad form and confidence perhaps? Due to the increased midfield competition. 

I also have a strong suspicion that he isn't playing for the manager either. The hiding away, the penalty miss - he did go to Van Gaal with Rooney and question the style. Not much to go on I know.

365~~~
I don’t agree that “he’s controlling the tempo of the game” is a fair assessment. If he did, he would sometimes quicken things up, but instead he ALWAYS keeps things on low speed.

He’s very different player to Xavi/Alonso/Pirlo.

366~~~
Of course he couldn't play on his own but if he was as good palyer as some people have always been saying he was we wouldn't see that big difference now, don't you think, players who can actually run is actually refreshing, while of course having other good tatributes other than good movement and stamina... Alsonso can come close to Carrick but he was always tougher player than Carrick, better tackler... don't rate either of them that high

367~~~
Barca fans had been calling for Xavi to get the chop. Juve fans had been calling for Pirlo to get the chop. Both those players I think we'll agree were significantly better players than any carrick, yet by this age they also suffered dramatic drops of form. 
Pep lost it earlier and got the chop, so did redondo and Albertini. All these players were outstanding, and better than him but got the chop and ended up in obscure leagues or not doing much with their careers after they were done. 

He's just done at the highest level of the game. He's been a great servant but honestly, when glacial mids lose a few yards, the writing is on the wall. 

However this doesn't mean we should re-write the past and say stuff like our midfield should've been better if he was that good as that's ridiculous. Football is a team sport and I think some lose vision of that. Great midfields are about partnerships. When scholes was running around with the djemba's and klebersons of this world he didn't look all that. Here's a better one, in Pirlos last few years at Milan he carried the brunt of the blame by the fans, he switches over to Juve which complements him with better quality in midfield and wins league player of the year back to back and is in the serie a team of the year 3 years straight.

368~~~
He doesnt like the philosophy nor does it suit his game. Sits on the bench lately, everybody can see he is desinterested and doesnt try/care anymore.

369~~~
I think Carrick's poor form has a lot to do with Van Gaal. Since we've bought Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger he's been pretty much a forgotten man. He's better than this.

370~~~
If this is Schneiderlin and Sweinsteigger, than he certainly is not better and that's not judging only by this game. if he deserves better than he shouldn't show us how "interested" he was today.. simply terrible considering he should be the one who takes the responsibility. He let Van Gaal down so he won't favour him no more since now and it's only a plus for team which should be finally build around modern dynamic players..

371~~~
WHy do you mention Djemba djemba, he barely played here, KLeberson was strieker IIRC and he hardly played either.. He played with Scholes and Fletcher, Hargreaves, than it became Cleverley and Anderson, even though before the big injury problems of the two and some confidence problems of Cleverley's they were on the verge to making it here, nd then it was only then when we started to struggle, everbody would say that our midfield was by far the weekest form all top teams after Scholes finally left...Carrick being the main man. Does it say anything? I think yes? If he was half good everbody says he could bring the midfield to another level.. but if a palyer is good when other players around him are good, it doesn't strike me as a n atribute of a top player who rather raises game of other palyers around him. He never looked like leader either and that was shown today..

And of course players age, I am grateful to him for good memories, his calm presence and superconcistency will be remembered but let's nto get carried away he should never be mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Pirlo, Xavi.

Now we are going to see the difference..

372~~~
When keane was sold, sir alex played a myriad of midfield partnerships with scholes, and at no point did it look like scholes could carry it. If he couldn't, why would carrick be able to?    

Also despite carrick being the only midfielder with some recognisable quality, we still managed to compete well. In fact, he was one of the main reasons we won the '13 title. How quickly we forget. Anderson can't cut it in brazil and clevs is now a proven mid table player. Fletch couldn't spend a minute away from the loo. These guys were never good enough. 

Before Scholes had even left our midfield was a shambles. We had a 40 year old winger that usurped scholes there. 

I wouldn't go as far as saying our midfield was by far the worst of the top teams in the prem. Prem mids have been lacking in quality for ages now hence they get shown up in europe. City used to have Barry and Toure. While Toure is class, Barry never was. Arsenal had Fabregas, song and at times wilshere. Wilshere had to carry them when they faced barca as the others went awol. Song couldn't defend. Fabregas hasn't had the bottle in ages. Chelsea's mids were old and past it. Essien had his injuries, lampard was old too, mikel has never been quality. 

We got away with it cause everyone else had the same issue really.

373~~~
Im a Carrick fan, one of my favourite players. I think some of the criticism in these forums is over the top. However I hope we replace him this summer, not because I want to see him go but its time for us to replace a 34 year old player with some high end younger talent to keep this team evolving in a positive direction. Hope he has some really good games for us before the end of the season but hope he leaves us at the end of the season. Top player for us over the years, will be sad when he does finally finish.

374~~~
Could still be his usual slow start to the season-thing. 

He's 34 though and has proved that he's behind BFS and Schneiderlin in the pecking order, rightly so.

375~~~
He's usually firing on all cylinders by October, though.

376~~~
I seem to remember him being poor until mid-november a couple of seasons? Might be my mind playing tricks on me.

Either way Schneiderlin's great so that's one position I'm not really concerned about.

377~~~
He doesn't start regularly now and isn't going to get a run of games to find his rhythm.

378~~~
Think it was Fergie himself that nominated October as the month when you'll start seeing the best of Carrick. 

He's not getting any chance to play his way into form so, in a way, it makes sense it takes longer. I agree Schneiderlin's great but we do miss the speed in transition that Carrick's passing can provide. Although that could well be down to Van Gaal's preferred approach as much as anything else.

379~~~
He's down the pecking order at the moment and it's going to stay that way.

380~~~
Only Schneiderlin will have had more Premier League minutes in midfield this season. The excuse of games is folly.

381~~~
Does anybody know what he was trying to do with his penalty last night? Hard to tell from the pictures, but it looked like something in between a Pirlo chip and a Rugby conversion...?

382~~~
This.

383~~~
He's always needed a run of games to get going. Fergie even said he started playing to his fullest after Christmas.

Funnily enough he didn't need to do that last season. When he played, he played well even with all the injuries getting in the way.

384~~~
Schweinsteiger as well.

385~~~
Exactly. In previous seasons he would start every game and build up a decent run of games before hitting his stride a few months into the season. This season is clearly different, with all the rotation in central midfield. Hardly outrageous (or even folly) to suggest this might have a part to play in him still being well below par.

386~~~
Yeah, I've just double checked, and up until the City game they'd played roughly the same amount of minutes, but Bastian has more now.

Both have started six league games, Bastian being subbed on four times, Carrick the three. There's not a lot in it. Plenty of time to impress either way.

387~~~
Still by far our best forward passer of the ball, with Blind being second and Schweinsteiger being 3rd. He and blind add a whole dimension to our play with midfield splitting passes to our forward players, triggering a direct final third play. It's a shame all our forwards are not like martial and don't capitalize on these passes. RVP was brilliant at using Carrick's passes

388~~~
Rotation has been predominantly sensible. Van Gaal has managed both Carrick and Bastian well given their age and recent fitness records, with a younger and fitter Schneiderlin getting the lion share of minutes. 

Carrick has had ample opportunity to impress and he hasn't. Personally, I don't think the two man midfield suits his game as it stands. He's better when playing at the base, albeit he had no interest in demonstrating that last night.

389~~~
Schweinsteiger has played 25% more than Carrick, I'd hardly class that as not a lot. I don't know why you're using just PL minutes anyway, all competitions work to getting in form and Schweinsteiger has played 243 minutes or 33% more minutes than Carrick. That is quite a lot.

390~~~
Schweinsteiger is a better player, as well as being three years younger. That he has more minutes isn't really surprising.

Plus, ignoring last night's game, Bastian has started the last three matches, with Carrick barely featuring. He's pulling away and cementing his place in the side now, so I'd expect that percentage to grow.

391~~~
You seem to be mistaking pointing out that Carrick has featured relatively infrequently this season (compared to usual) for criticism of the decisions behind this.

392~~~
Ultimately, I don't think he's played infrequently as you do. At the age of 34, he's still featured in nine out of our ten league games, starting six of those. He started against Arsenal and Liverpool, too; a show of faith, surely. 

He was heralded as one of our best players last season in spite of only playing 18 league games. I'm playing devils advocate a little, but the lack of match rhythm didn't prevent him from making positives contributions to the team then, so why now?

393~~~
His performances have annoyed me so far this season. I think he's actually most lowest ranked player in the index which I'm not surprised about because he's been crap. He's been a good player for us but if this carries on I think we should let him leave in the summer.

394~~~
Its like saying Rooney still can hit the ball and score screamers... he can't because in today's game he doesn't have time for that. YOu'd absolutely expect Carrick to boss the game agains Boro home, he isn't able to do that when we play top and well pressing teams like Arsenal. He's completely out of his depth.. what more can you say, Scholes would ddefo be the best passer in the team these days...

395~~~
Our next few games are against side we would be expecting to dominate in possession so I hope Carrick gets some time on the pitch despite him not having a good start to the season. Our best passer and I feel we are missing someone who plays balls forward.

396~~~
Unless BFS needs a rest, it'll be hard for Carrick now. I think this could be his last season here.

397~~~
Good first half so far, made some quality passes.

398~~~
Thought he was terrific; constantly looking to pass forwards for a change. Looks like we're seeing his usual slow start to the season come to an end.

399~~~
Thought he was brilliant 2nd half. He always looks to play forward and early, something other players lack.

400~~~
His forward passes were brilliant. I really hope he's just been off form this season because we could really do with an on form Carrick.

401~~~
Some quality interceptions and quality passing.

That was pretty good from him. Probably my MOTM.

402~~~
MOTM for me. Keeps the ball moving & actually tries to get it forward.

403~~~
Inconsistent tonight. Didn't know if he was going to send through a genius assist or blast it into the stands. Better from him though.

404~~~
MOTM for me.

I want to see how much forward and long passes he tried today. I am guessing majority of his passes were forward, and I mean real forward passes ,not sideway passes that count as forward.

405~~~
Some very good moments from him tonight

His passing sublime

406~~~
I don't get why people continue to underrate his contribution. His passing into the forwards is crucial for us.

407~~~
He's essential to us playing fluid, penetrative passing.

408~~~
Did his best to cut through the lines. Good performance.

409~~~
Sublime passing today. Dominated the midfield alongside Schweinsteiger. What a player. Needs to be managed like how Fergie did with the old guys. If that volley would have gone in <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

410~~~
Was good today much better than last week.

411~~~
So great to see a player always look for the through pass. Even though some of them didn't get to where they were supposed to he still kept looking for the runs, kept looking to move the ball forward.
Great to see again

412~~~
Thought he was the best player on the pitch. Great performance.

413~~~
For the first time this season he decided to wear his testicles and, shock horror, he plays very well.

What's frustrating is that Carrick's game is entirely mental. It has nothing to do with ability or lack of legs. When his head is right he's fantastic. When it isn't, we get 'Boro. More of the same, please.

414~~~
Very good from him today. Sometimes he just needs a couple games off to clear his head. Was keeping things ticking played some good balls from deep and some crucial interceptions

415~~~
He's always better in games where the opposition midfield sits off, he doesn't cope with pressure on the ball that well these days and in truth it was always his weak spot, but his passing through the lines adds a dimension to our play, he was in Imperial Probe Droid mode tonight.

416~~~
He usually picks up form in November. Will be interesting to see who starts now once Schneiderlin gets fit.

417~~~
He made some great passes to get us going. He tried to make the early pass.

418~~~
Welcome back Carrick, we've missed you. He was very good tonight, his passing was pretty much spot on. A lot more positive and decisive than any other time he's played this season. I hope I'm proven wrong and he's not finished with us just yet.

419~~~
if only he could perform like this every time hes on the pitch. gret performaance today, my top 3 str with lingard and mike

<i>No chance, Blind destroys him in killer passes, when's the last time Carrick played a pass like that? How many of those passes has Blind already played this season?</i>

What did you think of his passing against CSKA? His ball to Lingard was vital for our goal

421~~~
Wonderfully weighted pass for the goal, played a lot of sloppy passes as well though, one of which led to a chance. All in all a very good game from him, these are the games we should he playing both him and Blind, where we need that extra bit of vision to break down defenses.

422~~~
Carrick was so awesome in 2012/13 because of the amount of those forward passes he was playing in pretty much every game. When play is a bit slow and laborious and opposition have everyone behind the ball, those incisive passes to the forwards are crucial as they take several players out of the game in an instant.

423~~~
There were people trashing him in the match day thread calling him poor. And yet I thought he was really positive tonight with his passing and vision.

424~~~
His best performance so far this season. Hopefully he just experienced his usual slow start and is beginning to build up a head of steam now

425~~~
When he's in form he injects urgency with his quick passing between the lines. 

On a similar note I loved BFS's sudden burst through the middle - where did that come from?

426~~~
The matchday thread is knee jerky at the best of times, dread to think what is was like after nearly 4 games of not scoring!

Had a feeling he would get a start and he definitely delivered. Some of those passes were superb, reminded me of his 2012-13 season. That Scholesy-esque volley was brilliant too but whenever he hits a shot like that I question why on earth he doesn't strike from distance more often.

West Brom at home on Saturday so I hope he gets another start as we will be seeing a Tony Pulis bus parking masterclass I'm sure.

427~~~
I've seen his passing last night described as sublime, world class etc

How?

He was inconsistent with his passing, gave it away as often as he hit the target. However, the good thing is that he assisted the goal with the initial pass out to the right

428~~~
He took a while to get into the game. Some really sloppy moments in the first half. Was class in the second half though, hence the plaudits.

It was interesting that he seemed to get better as Schweinsteiger deteriorated. I still don't think they're a natural partnership. If you ask me, finding the right blend of CMs is an ongoing struggle that doesn't look like being solved yet. Carrick and the two Sch's are all so similar they almost seem to cancel each other out.

429~~~
Gave it away as often as he hit the target?

85 passes with a 89.4 percent completion (higher than any player bar Blind that started) rate according to Who scored. I'd say he hit his man often enough.

430~~~
I'd need to watch it again and count but I'd swear his pass completion would not be as high as that last night

431~~~
I see where you are coming from in the first half. He was either playing a fantastic pass through the lines but then gave it away carelessly a couple of times, one of which led to a counter attack. 2nd half he was still playing the great passes but cut out any sloppiness

432~~~
Still the teams best passer for me when he wants to be. Seemed to try a lot more positive forward passes last night which was pleasing and the pass for the goal was sublime.

433~~~
He only gave it away about three times but of course people will highlight the negatives and run with them.

434~~~
When he is on form and has time on the ball I still rate him as the player to break down opposition team defensive structures.

'breaking the bus' as it were

435~~~
Good Performance. Clearly the better midfielder yesterday. So maybe not yet done on that Level.

436~~~
I remember when there was a time when people used to make fun of him saying he only made sideways or back passes. His passing is very penetrative and his movement in midfield is actually very good. His close control and ability to turn and see a pass very quickly is totally underrated. As some have said, this is usually when he starts performing, he's a bit of a diesel. Looked great today, hope he can cement his starting spot in the team.

437~~~
He played a lot riskier than he has done recently, and it was great to see. I'd rather him lose possession trying incisive difficult passes than retain the ball in our own half. He's a very classy player and he's been written off prematurely on here by some.

438~~~
Again this thread is quiet after a good performance.

439~~~
Carrick and Herrera in a midfield two seems the most balanced on paper to me really. Has the blend of energy, passing range, creativity, attacking intent, defensive shielding. But that's only if we're going to do a 4-4-2 with 2 center mids. If we want a 4-2-3-1, with 2 holding mids, then Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger probably. The problem is, that our only central midfielder who is attack minded is Herrera. Carrick is capable of playing those incisive passes, but started the season really slowly so deservedly wasn't starting. And he's naturally a holding mid and not a creative/attacking minded midfielder who can run with the ball and make things happen like Herrera can. Also on Herrera, he's been playing a lot more reserved as a 10, and been too negative if anything, always just recycling possession. Van Gaal probably likes it more then how he was before, but it'd be better for us attacking wise if he took more risks like he is naturally inclined to do really.

440~~~
He thrives in these games where there's no pressure on the ball and he can probe away at the deep back line.

441~~~
Stretchered off for England

442~~~
Inevitable.

443~~~
I hate our players playing for England, I really do.

444~~~
FFS

445~~~
Well done Woy, leaving your oldest player on for 90 mins in a pointless friendly.

446~~~
It's honestly a formality at this point that one of our players gets injured during international break. 

fecking friendlies.

447~~~
some with balls at the club should tell him to quit if he wants a new contract. He's almost 35 ffs.

448~~~
inept tosser.

449~~~
Get well soon. He shouldn't be playing internationals at his age if he wanted to prolong his club career needless to say pointless friendlies.

450~~~
They've never deserved him. Annoying.

451~~~
feck off, just feck off!!

452~~~
Both Mike's in 1 game. Gutted.

453~~~
He looked pretty gutted as he went off. Hope it's nothing serious

454~~~

455~~~
What was it? Since been deleted.

456~~~
FFS. In a pointless fecking friendly. For Roy fecking Hodgson's pointless England! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

457~~~
Ligament damage. Feck off.

458~~~
So that's now Shaw, Valencia and Carrick with long term injuries. You would like to think Roy would use his brain with Carrick and Smalling. What are you going to learn from these players in a friendly? Nothing. Give others a chance and give these players a rest. Stupid

459~~~
If it is ligament damage and requires surgery you'd have to think he might struggle to return to full form after his recovery with him being 34

460~~~
Feck right off Woy.

Couldn't have put that better myself.

461~~~
Why is he still playing for England FFS!

462~~~
If Fergie was still manager, no way he will still be playing for England. Might not be ethical but club have to give him an ultimatum. This injury might end his time here.

463~~~
Moronic blaming Roy for him getting injured.
Equally moronic for Roy playing him.
Beggars belief the logic behind even selecting him for the squad.

464~~~
So fecking annoying. Right at the end as well. For him to be stretchered off can't be good signs either. Probably be out for at least 6-8 weeks, especially if its ligament damage.

465~~~
Pretty frustrating, but thats football. Blame whoever you want, but it is just sad and we have to kind of hope for the best.

466~~~
Thank f*ck we also added Schneiderlin to Schweini's arrival. I guess there's no excuse from putting Herrera constantly on the bench now. Perhaps another brave promotion from the academy or just full muppet in January ?

467~~~
Why the feck am I not surprised <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

468~~~
England pay the manager a fortune, Roy Hodgson is under qualified for the job, he only has it because of his nationality. I have little respect for the FA or him, surely you should choose the best candidate for the job as opposed to looking at their nationality!

And then the guy can't even get out of his group at the world cup. He doesn't even play Carrick that much so he can't be that valuable to the set up, ultimately though it's Carrick's fault because he isn't valued by England and should have left long ago.

Schneiderlin alongside Schweinsteiger is fine and I'm sure Herrera will get another chance there now and might impress.

469~~~
I fell asleep during the game but my Dad said he got injured, didn't realize it was this serious though. Bad injury at his age as well.

470~~~
FFS.

471~~~
What a surprise. Carrick and injured in same sentence. 
Kind of screws us up a lot knowing the BFS can not play a full 90 minutes. We really need to keep Schweinsteiger fit and Herrera needs to play, no excuse now.

472~~~
You know it's funny we keep Carrick fresh for later in the year and now he gets injured in a friendly

473~~~
Carrick's an idiot too. Gets sidelined for every major tournament and yet here he is at 34 playing in meaningless games for the country. Won't be anywhere near the starting 11 in the Euros either.

474~~~
Bullshit.  A good campaign for club and country would have given him every chance of playing in the euros. Hence, obviously, his willingness to play in friendlies. 

What the feck is it with people determined to be angry at someone or other for every United player that gets injured? Lashing out like that is really quite childish.

475~~~
Yeah, just like previous campaigns where his good form has resulted in him starting games in major tournaments. He's been ignored even when he was our main CM and the undoubted best English CM. Not to mention he'll be 35 when the Euros come around and is no longer a 90mins player for us. 

Btw, there was hardly any anger or 'lashing out' in the post you quoted, you'd know why you made it out to be something it isn't.

476~~~
Ok Neville ended his career with a similar injury.  Carrick should have thought of United before England. England can feck right off,  this is the end of his United career . Woy is a genius.

477~~~
Ankle ligament tears rarely require surgery. If it's a severe one (him being stretched off suggests it is) he probably won't return this year though.

I'm currently recovering from a ligament injury and just started running (barely), after 6 weeks. His might be different though, obviously.

478~~~
What the feck is wrong with you guys? How on earth is this Hodgson's fault? He has a tournament to prepare for, he is entitled to try to build and mound a team with whatever players he likes. If he plays U20s every game and then switches at the tournament, the same people will be quick to criticise him. Carrick getting injured is unfortunate, Roy playing one of his footballers in a football match is logical.

479~~~
Carrick doesn't play 90 minutes for United that often in competitive matches! Yet in a friendly against Spain who dominated the ball Carrick gets injured in the 91st minute.

It will be interesting to see Louis van Gaal's opinion on this, Hodgson has a responsibility to act sensibly.

480~~~
And playing him a week before the next United match is sensible. He most likely would have been rested for the France match had it went ahead and he was fit.

Hodgson also has a limited amount of games left to figure out his best team before a major tournament.

481~~~
If Louis van Gaal tends to not use him for 90, why would Hodgson think to use him for 90 is a good idea? 

I don't see how Hodgson using Carrick for 90 minutes in a major tournament with a quick succession of games is sensible.

482~~~
Van Gaal has more options to pick from for that role than Hodgson. Who could Hodgson have brought on for him that wouldn't have forced him to reshuffle the whole team?

I agree if Hodgson was to do that next summer it wouldn't be sensible. There's no indication he will though, and I think it's more likely Carrick will be rotated well if he is to go.

483~~~
Bringing on Shelvey earlier wouldn't have required any reshuffling of the team

484~~~
Well, Shelvey is more of a box to box or attacking midfielder than a defensive one and if Hodgson did put him there it'd still require a change of tactics as Shelvey wouldn't be able to play the role like Carrick does.

485~~~
If Carrick's injured. Then there's your Herrera playing time. I guess we can finally see W consistent run for Ander and how that affects the team.

486~~~
I'm not sure the two are related to be honest. If Carrick is injured it probably means Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin start every game. 

I think Lingard has more effect on Herrera. If he's playing well,  Rooney plays in the number 10 position with Martial up front. Rather than Martial playing from the left with Rooney up top and Herrera behind.

487~~~
Fair point. But
Champions League and FA Cup means rotation and that means more playing time for Ander if not a consistent run in the side. 

Suddenly, having this many midfielders in the team has become a blessing. This is hoe a top club should function. One injury means equally good people step up.

488~~~
Some odd reactions in this thread

489~~~
As foolish as that may sound, I think he should be playing for England only if they promise him he'll be playing on tournament. There is really no reason for him to play for them if they continue playing/ignoring him as they did over last 10 years or so.

Btw, any news?

490~~~
pray for carrick,

although he was hitting good form I have no doubt we will cope with this loss with no pain, he's well covered by Basti and we also have two great players in Herrera and Morgan who showed on many occsions we don't really need Carrick..

491~~~
Him not playing 90 regularly for United is his United manager's perogative. If his international manager decides 'I'd like to see Carrick for 90 mins against this lot', he's not going to think 'actually, maybe not, he may turn his ankle at the death'. That’s football, it's what Carrick signed up for and what he gets paid big bucks for. Club fans are quick to turn on 'stupid international managers' who overlook Carrick or one of their players, but don't seem to realise this is the unglamorous bits that earn players a spot in the international tournaments. 

Carrick's injury is unfortunate, nothing more in my opinion. It is not a fecking travesty that he played a football match. That’s what he does.

492~~~
Reasons to hate pointless international games; number 234......

<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Hurry back, Michael.......
(although with Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin at least we are well covered compared to previous years, there is also Fellaini and Jones could play there if needed)

493~~~
Herrera and Blind should be ahead of Jones there

494~~~
And Fellaini.

I hope Sean Goss gets a run out in the team now as he is a similar player to Carrick, would be great to see another young talent of our added to the squad. It could be a blessing in disguise. Carrick aint getting any younger and if he has had a serious injury then it might just be the last we see of him.

495~~~
He was on the pre-season tour wasn't he?

496~~~
Ogden writes that he'll most likely only miss Watford and PSV.

497~~~
Unsure if this is the first thing Ogden has published that I actually like the sound of...

498~~~
How about Moyes getting the sack?

499~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

500~~~
I avoided his every word following the denial of anything wrong in the build up to that moment.

501~~~
Yeah he's was, made a cameo against PSG

502~~~
Available for saturday.

503~~~
Very good to hear. Hopefully we keep him on the bench for it if he's not 100% though.

504~~~
Jaysus, that's a quick recovery. He tweeted a video of himself in full kit (wanker) yesterday but couldn't believe it had been filmed the same day. Great news.

505~~~
He must give some of those senzu beans to Martial and Luke Shaw.

506~~~
little cunning hodgson, he was just kidding.

507~~~
Hodgson should have planned this in advance not when he was out there, he knew it was a friendly and any risks with a player is not going to help anybody. Carrick having a good season for United benefits England as much as United therefore handling a player responsibly is important.

I can't see how playing him for 90 minutes (in a friendly) was ever the wise thing to do when he has hardly done that this season for United.

As it is he seems to be fine which is lucky but it's important the manager handles players sensibly.

508~~~
If Carrick has hardly been playing 90 minutes for United then it's always a risk to use him for 90 minutes against Spain but for me the sensible thing is not to take the risk in a <i>friendly</i>. Use him for 60 or 70 minutes, risking injury is never sensible in a friendly because the player having a good season with his club and staying fit helps England.

As it is he seems fine but it was still a poor decision and Hodgson will have to improve his handling of him if he is to maximise his effectiveness this summer.

509~~~
He's been absolutely fecking hopeless today.

510~~~
He seems to have hit the wall as well.  Needs replacing after this season.

511~~~
Needs to come off. A fecking liability.

512~~~
Oh definitely. He's cooked.

Slow isn't a strong enough word and I don't care if he's never been fast. I mean, he's literally a pensioner out there. Then again, maybe I'm blinded, as I've always had a grudge against him for his shitty and pathetic closing down for Robben's goal in 2010.

He's a passenger and we already have too many in this squad. Retire at the end of the season Mike, you're done.

513~~~
Looks utterly out of his depth at this level now

Probably shouldn't play again if you ask me.

514~~~
Apparently he played today.

515~~~
Pedestrian, we need a different type of midfielder to move forward.

516~~~
What a negative performance that was from Carrick. First half hour he was absolutely shocking.

517~~~
Yup. What was his purpose today?  He didn't so anything defensively (in fact he in pulled out of a couple of 50/50s), he didn't dictate the tempo of our play and he created absolutely nothing.

518~~~
Invisible. Just like Mata. Doesn't have the legs anymore. His passing was woeful as well today.

519~~~
Was shocked to see him play the whole game today. Crap performance.

520~~~
I didn't think he was that bad.

Kept us ticking over with his passing and maintained possession.

I doubt we would have had control of the game from 70 minutes onwards if he hadn't of played and I doubt Schweinsteiger could have played beyond 60 minutes if Carrick wasn't there to help control the game.

521~~~
Some decent threaded balls but he needs more protection next to him against teams that break with pace.

522~~~
I thought he looked the only player looking to play it forward all the time, at least he tried

523~~~
He looked a little rusty at first but worked well into the game, and helped us control the match. Had zero forward runners to pick out so was limited to tame passes into feet, but overall we definitely needed him back.

524~~~
Terrible first half but one of our better players in the 2nd. Think it would have made more sense to ease him in from the bench

525~~~
Agree. He was a lot better after a shaky start. Surprised he played the full game after coming back from an injury though.

526~~~
Much better second half.

527~~~
Don't think we had many options, schneiderlin could have come in but he wouldn't have offered much in the forward passing stakes, it was quite a slow tempo all game so I think that helped keep his legs really.

528~~~
Very poor first half. A good second half.

529~~~
Needs us to be in control of games to have the necessary time and space to be effective. It's always been his problem because he simply does not have the ability to create time and space for himself and that's what has kept him a level below the best. He needs an absolute fecking age on the ball.

Can't have him here beyond this season and if we are injury free he shouldn't be starting.

530~~~
Thought he was awful today. Plenty of forward passes to please <i>some</i> but nearly all of them pointless hospital passes. Offers feck all protection as well.

Looked completely fried by the end to boot.

He's done.

531~~~
Thought he did well when he came on.

532~~~
I thought he added some urgency to our play, the problem is he really needs the 2 man protection in there these days, the double pivot leaves him much to exposed to any counters.

533~~~
He's having a stop start season but I'd have his quick passes into the forwards above Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin's backward passing any day.

534~~~
its harsh on him, he was trying to be positive, thats a plus from me, but that should come from the whole team... but its carricks mobility which has been a problem last couple of years, 31 yo sweinsteigger who feels at times like 38 yo next is to him not helping at all...

anyways hard to blame individuals , we have seen that we can play really good stuff if we want but we are not doing it because of managers negative tactic.. hes the main problem...

535~~~
He was miles better then Bastian or Morgan

536~~~
That's rubbish. Not every ball came off yes, but some of them were down to mis-passing. Added urgency when United needed to, to please "some"? Well that includes me as I'm sick to death of this zombie passing. Look how many chances United had compared to West Ham in the first half

537~~~
At least he understands the problem..

538~~~
Aye, who wants penetrative passes anyway.

539~~~
Our best passer. Should play everyweek. Maybe give Swcheinsteiger a more advanced role.

540~~~
His passing is good, but when harried, he turns to jelly and the opposition win the ball back with ease. Off the ball, players seem to walk through him and he's not mobile enough to recover.

His forward passing is among the best in the squad, along with Blind, but he looks so easy to win the ball from or take on.

541~~~
If he looks done then I worry about Schneiderlin.

542~~~
Forward passes into the front men. The other CM's need to wake up and observe that.

543~~~
We have no one in our midfield that can play those penetrative passes into the front men. Every time he did that, there was danger. I think this is why we need to play with two wingers who hug the touchline. It will stretch teams and allow Carrick to find more of those passes to the attacking midfielder and forward.

544~~~
This is it, he's still our best passer but he really struggles out of possession these days, we need to get a CM that does what he does on the ball but is about 10 years younger.

545~~~
Those type of wingers are dated and offer no goal threat, the fullbacks need to take up that wider slack in modern football.

546~~~
His thread quiet again. He was class as usual. He showed urgency and wanted to attack every time he got the ball. 

Yes he left us exposed a few times but he was trying to score. We were at Old Trafford.

he is better than BFS and still our best midfielder. Id like to see him with Herrera and Morgan.

547~~~
That he is. 

I thought the idea behind getting Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin was to rotate Carrick with Schweini and then play Herrera & Schneiderlin on either side of them in a 433, with those guys taking up the box to box roles. Still would prefer that midfield combination instead of the way we set up currently in a 4231.

548~~~
Still our best CM when it comes to passing, be it the tempo or range of it. BFS's mobility makes him more suited to play the midfielder who supports the attack though.

549~~~
I agree and id like to see BFS deployed further forward when Herrera isnt playing.

550~~~

551~~~
That was great. Going to listen to the Neville and Fletcher ones later too.

552~~~
This is awesome. Funny to hear him speak about 'Arry and how important it is to let young players make mistakes, instead of punishing them and discouraging them from trying things. Can't imagine who he means.

553~~~
I've been among Carrick's biggest supporters since he came to OT. I've always valued him highly - until this year. The deterioration in his play has been dramatic. A lot of it is probably system related, but in the context of that system he's been positionally poor. Add that to a lack of speed (he's only just faster that Mata - which makes him glacial) and passing that is way below his previous level and he's almost unrecognisable as the Carrick we know and (in my case) love. It's become a problem that he and Mata are slowing our transition game to the point that the opposition have plenty of time to reorganise when they lose possession.

554~~~
Yeah, shocking the difference when he is in. No one can ping in the passes into the middle like he can, it seems. BFS is more likely to try penetrating via pass & move or even trying to dribble through, but he doesn't have the pace anymore to be as effective as previously, while Schneiderlin seems to favor the diagonal to the corners (which he is effective at), but then the move tends to die there as we're less able (or less willing) to get a good cross in. TBH, if it was Rooney or Mata who was the target of some of those passes, we'd probably have been able to nick a goal, but it was Fellaini. Granted, he did well, but he turns like a battleship and we needed a cutter. 

Wish Ander was available tomorrow, but we're likely to see Carrick & BFS, maybe teamed with Fellaini, but I wish we'd put Mata in the #10 hole, while using Memphis & Lingard on the wings.

555~~~
Those that said he was on the bench to replace Schweini when he ran out of steam were spot on, but I think he should have been on at half time.

556~~~
He was marking Naldo for the winner, that's the problem with him, he isn't aggressive enough. There was no attempt to hold him back, no force. Their most dangerous player on set pieces had a free run to the ball. 5 mins to go and we need a winner he's strolling around waiting for our fullback to take a throw in, no urgency. 
His forward passing, when he's interested in playing them are a real strength, but his presence in midfield isn't aggressive enough and for me he just doesn't exude that winning spirit a senior player and a midfielder at United should have.

557~~~
He's such a weak, petal of a player and always has been. His marking for the third is just Carrick all over.

I'm sorry but stuff like that really pisses me off. I don't really buy into the 'chest beating' stuff that some others desire but when defending I do expect players to put themselves properly to the task and do everything they can to defend properly.

It's not good enough. He was doing it in 2010 (pathetic closing down of Robben) and he's still a spineless git when it comes to defending.

558~~~
LVG's fault Carrick can't mark at corners.  Imagine if that was Fellaini - he still got more abuse for the game than Carrick even though he won a vital header for a goal whereas wonderbread wanders of his man 5 minutes from the end on a corner. 

Terrible from a senior pro.

559~~~
Anyone else think he's played really well? Actually looked to pass it forward which improved things.

560~~~
Yup, he's looked vastly improved.

He's getting time though so he should look more comfortable. Fellaini taking some attention and Bournemouth aren't pressing him.

561~~~
pretty good half by his standards but him and fellaini is really piss poor midfield overall, no signs of mobility, throw in someone as average as cleverley with no brain, just legs and we gonna win this game, absolutely no sense of closing down players, big holes in midfiled, its really nice to see players trying to press higher up the pitch but fellaini and carrick cant cover the ground as quickly, that one of the reasons we are so prone to be counter-attacked well..

562~~~
He always does. Great ball for the goal that only he and Blind can play.

563~~~
Our best player by a mile in first half, and probably still the club's best midfielder when on form. No one is even close when it comes to passing and dictating the play.

564~~~
He picks out passes like he's playing fecking FIFA. But yeah let's play Schneiderlin cos he runs around a bit

565~~~
He has looked good. Can find just about any pass forward.

We usually look more positive with him in the side

566~~~
Superb pass to Memphis for the equaliser

567~~~
Playing really well at the moment, it's a clear tactic to pick put Memphis early and to be fair he's been almost inch perfect with those passes. Encouraging, I just want to see him carry this level of positivity into our tougher games.

568~~~
Agree with <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> too

569~~~
So Bournemouth figured out their first half mistake, put a closer watch, pressed him and he's totally disappeared this half.

570~~~
Did all he could IMO, some quality passing in the first half but was always going to struggle once pressed as Fellaini was so far up the field most of the time.

571~~~
Still the best central midfielder at this club.

572~~~
His passing is a level above anyone else at the club.

573~~~
Still baffled how he didnt start in one of our biggest games midweek.

574~~~
His passing was top class particularly in the first half, at the moment I think he offers us more than Schneiderlin.

575~~~
Decent on the ball but has barely got the legs for a 2 man midfield let alone the 1 man system he played in today, had absolutely no help defensively in there.

576~~~
Neat passing when given time and space.

Velvet draped pussy as soon as an opposition player comes close to him, fannied out of a 50/50 when Norwich scored.

577~~~
Nowadays he is a regista behind two CM's, two man midfield doesn't work for him anymore it's obvious.

578~~~
Thought he played well today. He's usually the one who starts our attack going by probing the defence with his passing.

This

He needs to to play in the 4-1-2-3 rather the 4-2-3-1. The second formation is the one he doesn't have the legs for not the 4-3-3.

579~~~
It would have been nice to play two CM's alongside him then. Playing Mata and Fellaini either side of him is suicidal. Neither of the two can run or defend. He was basically a one man midfield.

580~~~
Yeah, it certainly wasn't a traditional 4-3-3, LvG kept the suicidal experiment from Wolfsburg to keep the fans happy with more direct football. Fair to say it didn't work out.

581~~~
Even a two man midfield alongside Ander would go a long way, a three with Ander and Schneiderlin would be best though. Mata doesn't offer anything in midfield so you can't even count him and I don't know what Fellaini was doing today. Wasn't getting up into attacks and wasn't defending either. You're leaving any midfielder out to dry like that let alone one like Carrick whose deficiencies are his physical capabilities.

582~~~
I still think we wasted his prime. As much as he won, I think we could have done more for him and the team (especially for CL) by giving him competent midfielders to play with.

However now, the way were using him is kinda shocking. 34, and hes pretty much still a one man midfield for 90 minutes. Madness

583~~~
Back to his usual standards for most of this season today. He doesn't seem very charismatic as a person but in the dressing room I can imagine he holds a huge influence and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

584~~~
Another player van Gaal has no idea how to use and yet he is playing quite good when you consider it. Playing him alongside Mata and Fellaini is something that even the most clueless managers wouldn't do.

His passing is excellent as always, that pass for Rooney when he messed up the first touch from the halfway line into their box was amazing. Probably still the best passer in premierleague.

585~~~
What the hell?

586~~~
In a midfield of Mata, Fellaini and Carrick we are so, so slow. Anyway, I thought Carrick was average. He played some pretty nice passes but he is essentially fighting a losing battle being a one man midfield.

587~~~
I remember when Moyes was in charge he come out and did a post match interview and did nothing to help the guy, I can imagine he's reacting the same towards van Gaal. I could be way off the mark here but he strikes me as being like a player from the Chelsea team wanting the manager to be sacked when the chips are down.

588~~~
He shows urgency with his passing. Actually he isour second best attacker which reveals the major problem.

his passing between the lines was excellent again even though a few were off the mark.

He would be so much better with Schniederland and Herrera or one of the youngsters.

He cant do it all on his own.

589~~~
People interpret a lot from a limited interview where most players are too concerned with being politically correct. What is there to suggest that he is going all rogue in the dressing room, spy like to get people against the manager? Silly stuff.

590~~~
Shocking this season.

591~~~
Looks completely past it.

592~~~
Terrible game, probably worst of the season, nowhere to be found on the pitch.

593~~~
Hilarious how he still plays for us <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

594~~~
Him and Rooney should be gone in summer. Great servants, but they both past it now.

595~~~
When the going gets tough he shrivels. Nothing new.

596~~~
typical carrick shitting himself when on the pitch to be one of the leaders, hats off to his career he was consistent performer but his legs are long gone, him wearing the armband only shows the lack of leaders in the team, if it wasnt for Mata having a shocker with fellaini and memphis out of the game as well I wouldnt hesitate to take him down and play our best defensive player Schneiderlin, carrick cant just help herrera to win the ball in midfield, fellaini being two steps behind is not helping at all.. 

It could work if all the players were in some kind of form but Herrera just got back and the team is in deep shit.. you can expect it to work suddenly lining up in this set up first time this year

597~~~
Yep been Carricks biggest fan but not a truer word spoken. Rabbit in headlights stuff again from him. His legs are gone also far to many players running off him.

598~~~
Forgot he was playing.

599~~~
I think it's time to bring him on and control this game...

600~~~
He's not playing is he? it actually looks like we have 10 men.

601~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

602~~~
When Michael Carrick is your captain and  leader you know you're fecked. Where the hell was he in that second half. Never seen a disappearing act like it

603~~~
Should just be playing in home games where we can dominate possession and he has time and space.

604~~~
Brilliant player for us over the years. Thank you for that.

But it does seem to be time.

605~~~
He's a furiating figure to watch when we're down and needing a goal. No urgency, the player on the ball next to him is begging for him to run into the space in front of him but he cannot be moved.

606~~~
Goes hiding when things get tough, it's always been the case and it's the main reason he never made the step-up to top class.

607~~~
He is finished, especially defensively he doesnt exist. It was coming for quite some time now and people would always say he is a slow starter, but i think this time it has more to do with it that he is just past it.

608~~~
Sad thing is unlike other times he didn't  even have a midfielder marking him out of the game, he just ghosted around taking no responsibility and not having a grip on the game.

So many times Herrera was dropping between defenders to collect the ball.

609~~~
I honestly didn't evn realise he was playing until I randomly saw him saunter across the pitch in the 86th minute. He's done.

610~~~
He looked about 60 loping around out there, the game just passed him by as Stoke pressed him out of it.

611~~~
Made the invisible man jealous today.

612~~~
i wish he had played today.

613~~~
Plays like someone that has downed tools.

614~~~
Pretty much.

For the 2nd time in 3 seasons.

Never really warmed to Carrick tbh.

615~~~
He should have a lot more ball. He's too far up in LVG system. He is only an engine who keeps the ball in possession and dominate games.

616~~~
I hate the way that he never actually tackles or pressures people unless they are infront of the box, so many times he follows people out to midfield and just lets them turn or pass without pressure just because they are going away from goal.

We miss schneiderlin badly in that regard that he's always nibbling away looking to pick up the ball high up the pitch.

617~~~
Shocking.

618~~~
Schneiderlin hasn't exactly set the world alight but we really miss him when he doesn't play and it's obvious that Carrick, Herrera and Schweinsteiger aren't able to win the ball effectively enough for playing CM in the PL

619~~~
So old, so experienced. Still hasn't the guts to dictate a game. Not one inch of balls in our good old Michael

620~~~
Statistically we are far better with him in the team. Herrara and Schweinsteiger create things and actually want the ball also, which is something our midfielders don't seem to want.

621~~~
Terrible during this match, probably the most invisible I think I've ever seen him. But people writing him off entirely are too harsh, he was very good the last two matches and on his good days he's still the best central midfielder at the club.

622~~~
Carrick has been a great servant to our club...but it is time to put him to pasture and start to rebuild our squad (again).

623~~~
Underwhelming again. Looks like he is past it but then again so does half the squad playing under van Gaal.

624~~~
What? No he wasn't and no he's not.

625~~~
Lives up to his criticisms at the worst of times.


Still a United great.

626~~~
And people will dare to speak of how good he has been defensively for us over years, he was always helped out by Fletcher doing the dirty work for him, as well as Rooney or the fifth midfielder in big games, because we always struggled off the ball, positionally he has been okay, filling spaces well but thats the basics central midfielders should do, but if you dont put any pressure on the player or try to tackle you will always watch team backing off but at some point you just need someone to make that tackle, you cant wait for the other team to make mistakes as the quality goes up and you see that even Stoke can easily be very dangerous if given space and that is what exactly Carrick does, his last good season was that last one under Fergie and that was it. Since that should have been used as a squad player maximum.

Wonder why our most creative midfielder Herrera had to do everything for Carrick on the pitch, linking up the play, dropping deep trying to set up attacks, covering basically all ground but you cant press with one player in midfield and I am genuinely annoyed when people start comparing Carrick to Keane in terms of how good and important they were for us, Keane was always the better player as was fletcher in his prime but you wont explain this to some people as they have short memories and still sing its hard to believe its not scholes, a chant that started that last season under Fergie iirc, the only season when Carrick could be considered one of the best in the country. He would be exactly the player England didnt needed if they wanted to progress

627~~~
Spot on. He was not a regular starter when Fletcher was at his best and Scholes/Anderson were fit and was underwhelming for a large period of time. 

When he's given the Scholes role i.e. sit back and don't worry about running he's been mixed he's fine for the most part except this season it seems father time has caught up with him.

628~~~
He is 35 guys, we have to also remember that. I do think we need to go big this summer again and get ANOTHER class midfielder, but somebody more rounded this game. Younger than a 31 year old schweinsteiger too, somebody again in Herrera's mould IMO.

629~~~
I actually didn't realize he was playing... serious, I saw the whole game and don't remember him even touching the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

630~~~
We should have been looking for Carrick's replacement, not a BFS, someone younger to be made ready to take over. Him, Morgan and Ander and even with a BFS for cover, we would be in better shape.

631~~~
He was top-class in Fergie's last season. He couldn't be further away from it now though.

632~~~
I mean Alonso-level, he never reached that IMO.

633~~~
He's been off and on for years and for me he's underperformed for years 99% of the time taking the easy option, don't get me wrong he's been great sometimes but I believe if he had the balls he would have been a far better player than he has been.

634~~~
That's because Alonso was just simply better and more talented. 

Carrick was pretty great himself, and carried a midfield with the likes of Cleverly to a league title and was a great supporting act in our success in the late 00s.

635~~~
I still rate him as one of the best, if not the best, midfielder in the country. He'd probably walk into any of Barca, Real, or Bayern sides. 

He's been a great servant of the club for 10 years. We are lucky to have him in the team as he has been the foundation of many of our successes in the last decade. 

It will be a sad day for Manchester United when he retires.

636~~~
What in the name of feck are you smoking? He would never have walked into any of those teams in his prime, let alone now.

637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

638~~~
Perhaps not in terms of pressing or mobility, but he's as good if not a better passer than any player in those teams. He just needs a water carrier next to him at this age.

639~~~
You need to up your bloody standards to casually throw around plaudits like that.

Assuming you're not trolling which you may well be.

Would walk into Barca or Bayerns team? Not even during a fecking injury crisis, he's too bloody immobile.

640~~~
What am I reading? He's a better passer than Busquets, Iniesta, Kroos, Modric, Alonso, Thiago? 

I mean Xavi Hernandez who's arguably the best midfielder of all time and one of the best passers ever couldn't make his way into those teams last season, how does Carrick manage to do it then?

641~~~
Today was his 400th appearance for Manchester United. What a majestic player.

642~~~
So, is he injured?

643~~~
I'd like to know as well.

644~~~
I was confused about why he didn't play. Was he on the bench?

645~~~

646~~~
Read in a few places (Internet, United related fanzines) that he's retiring at the end of the season. 

No idea how true it is but, he's 35 and has been ran into the ground.

647~~~
Seems fair, either way we'll definitely need to replace him in the summer.

648~~~
More like casually ambled into the ground <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

649~~~
Wouldn't surprise me. I can't see him play anywhere else but United now.

650~~~
Been a class player, I think he qualifies for a well deserved testimonial at the end of the season too if the plans on retiring then.

651~~~
He's been fantastic for us.

I know he was doing his coaching badges so I'd love for him to stay on in a coaching capacity.

652~~~
Think it's his last season with us. Whether he retires is another matter. Been a class player for us and deserves a testimonial.

653~~~
Still got something to offer imo. Surround him with competent players and he's still got the passing to hurt most teams

654~~~
Can't carry immobile players in the premier league. Every pair of legs count.

It's just a shame that our senior players seem to be fading at the same point in time, and we haven't adequately replaced them. Which, incidentally, is Fergie fault for once rather than Moyes or Van Gaal.

655~~~
I'll be so sad if and when he retires. 

My favorite United player of the last 10 years- he is absolute class and was incredibly underrated for a large part of his career.

656~~~

657~~~
When's he back?

658~~~
One of the most under-rated United midfielders ever. 

The only consistent in Uniteds midfield throughout the most successful period of it's history.

659~~~
That would be Roy Keane.

660~~~
The side that got to 3 champions league finals, won it once and won the league 4 times in a 5 year period didn't contain Roy Keane.

661~~~
Amen. People put too much emphasis on "strong" personality and not enough on "calming influence".

662~~~
94-02

Doubles, treble, etc.

663~~~
Dominated domestically when there wasn't as strong opposition as their currently is. Nowhere near as successful in Europe.

664~~~
Exactly. Absolutely majestic player, and utterly bizarre that you get people who don't rate him.

665~~~
Was a harder competition to win in the 90s, especially with the foreigner rule which meant that the likes of Keane and Irwin were counted as foreign players. Along with Cantona, and Hughes.

666~~~
He's been unfairly castigated this season due to people wanking off to our shit new toys. Still the best passer in the team by some distance.

667~~~
Without doubt.

668~~~
Finally some respect from him here. Reading some of the posts it's like his career is over. Sure, he was much better last season, but he still adds calmness and passing range to the team (when he isn't paired with Fellaini).

Incredibly underrated and seems the be the scapegoat whenever anything goes wrong.

669~~~
Getting to finals isn't success.

670~~~
Come on now. Getting to 3 CL finals in 4 years is a magnificent achievement. I call that success even if we lost two of them to the best team ever.

671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> aye we might as well get put out in the group stages. 

We got to the final and got beat off probably the best club side of all time.

672~~~
Scholes, Ronaldo etc played no part <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 

Carricks been a very good player for United and I would hope he has another season or two in him. He's not (seemingly) put on any weight, or lost any pace <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. We'll have to wait and see.

673~~~
Achievement,  yes. Success for a club as big as United is winning the competition. 

Also our midfield was actually our weakness those years masked and negated by the strength of our attack and defence whereas in Keane"s time I imagine the midfield, or he at least, was one of the strongest parts.

674~~~
Absolutely.

675~~~
Great player, no doubt, but he's a liability in terms of fitness.  Hope we find a younger, less injury prone option in the main window.

676~~~
Getting to the final is not success. It is still loosing, its just loosing later and having built your hopes up.

677~~~
Carrick was one of the reasons our defence was so good. He was the #6 sat in front of them.

678~~~
Aye, it's a good thing we got knocked out in the group stages this year, as we would of just been beaten at some point.

679~~~
Yeah, true. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

680~~~
Point still stands, failing is failing if its in the qualifiers or the final.

681~~~
Where would you rather finish in the league? 5th or 15th? Both are failures right? 

Point doesn't still stand. The club would rip your hand off for a final appearance nowadays.

682~~~
That's some mighty pithy bs there. Getting to the final is not the same as going out in the group stage.

683~~~
How is it different? you've done better, Ill admit, but ultimately failed to win the competition.  
Im sure the club would because they get a lot more cash for it, but from my point of view you still havent won it. Can you be proud of it, yes, i think so, can you class it as success, not if you are Manchester United no. Would Real class loosing in the final as success? Bayern? Barca? No. Would Leicester Liverpool or Newcastle class it as success? Probably, they aren't Utd. Ask Keano if he would class loosing in the final as success, or Eric, or SAF, I bet my balls they would all say no.

684~~~
It's clear that we need to replace him properly in the summer. Verratti or Gundogan would be interesting options to check

685~~~
This is so deliberately obtuse it's basically trolling.

Here, I'll bite:

- More players get to play more matches against ever-better opposition. Your squad gets important European experience.
- In getting to the final, you've clearly beaten a number of good teams, perhaps one or two of the best teams. This suggests that you are much better than going out to the likes of CSKA in the group stage does. You almost certainly have a better chance of winning the thing than a team who went out in the group stage.
- Money. You get a fecktonne more getting to the final than you do going out in the group stage. Matchday takings, broadcast fees, commercial desirability.
- Fans get to watch a string of top matches. Many would argue that these days the big CL ties are as good as football gets.
- A club that reaches a CL final will be more attractive to the top players, managers and other staff.

686~~~
Keane didn't even class winning it as winning it, having not played in the final.

687~~~
All absolutely correct, all very good things, all things to be proud of. Still not success. A club of our stature should be aiming to win any competition it is in. Anything less is not success.

688~~~
We need him back. Him and Blind are the only 2 who are willing to play the killer pass instead of recycling possession.

689~~~
Some are being too cynical about this.

When United won the Premier League and Champions League double in 07/08, United lost to Portsmouth in the 6th round of the FA Cup (at home mind you). That was bizarre the fact 99% of all people would have fancied United to FA Cup glory because the team was that superior to the other semi-finalists in West Brom, Cardiff and Barnsley. Obviously there is too much hindsight in this saying United would have been Treble winners once again, however that was a great FA Cup run.

A club of United's stature, the standards are always win what you're in. Europa League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, etc. Achieving the ultimate goal of winning a competition should never detract from what you've accomplished. 19 teams will not will the Premier League. If United finish 2nd this year let's say, it would be deemed successful. But ultimately, not the ultimate goal/success and certainly you'll hear that from LVG and players.

When United lost to AC Milan in CL semi-finals in 06/07, that was a success because the team made a run that wasn't really expected in the CL. But we saw the progress made by Ronaldo and Rooney and team to really make a run the next year or two or three. Sure there's massive disappointment, but you have to include some realistic perspective.

690~~~
Keane is an absolute tool then. It's about the club winning not individuals.

691~~~
He makes such a difference in the build up. His pass to Martial for the 3rd goal is exactly what we've missed.

692~~~
That pass form Carrick to Martial for the 3rd goal is exactly the kind of forward passing we have been missing! Hes crucial to us, he really is.

693~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Glad I am not the only one who appreciated it!

694~~~
Hasn't Blind been doing that all season? Infact he's been doing it tonight.

Still good to see him back, would love to see him come straight in for Fellaini, I can dream right?

695~~~
Different doing it from midfield then from the back though... not only because your starting position is more advanced.

696~~~
I agree Blind has, but its not his duty to do so as a CB really, we need someone in the middle of the park to be doing it higher up the pitch. Hopefully Carrick can remain fit till the end of the season, will be a huge help.

697~~~
He wasnt in much of a different position to what Blind often takes up when we are in position, still great pass and glad he's back.

698~~~
Just about to post the same thing. Makes a world of difference.

699~~~
So glad to see him back. He showed what we miss in midfield when he came on.

700~~~
It's Carrick, you know...

701~~~
Came in and controlled the game. Schneiderlin has a looong way to go.

702~~~
And here I thought it was impossible to hit clever, quick and incisive passes when you're next to Fellaini in midfield...

703~~~
About a minute before the 3rd goal (I think it was on 81 mins) there was a moment where he took the ball off the back four and just effortlessly found a forward pass straight into our forward players. The contrast to what we get from our other midfielders in that situation is stark. He is a cut above.

704~~~
He's pretty much the only central midfielder (possibly even factor in the #10s) who can play a penetrative pass in our side. That is pretty staggering.

705~~~
Needs to play always pretty much

706~~~
Glad he's back. Nearly gave away a goal if not for the players poor first touch.

707~~~
Wish he was 28. We need more players than we think.

708~~~
Oozes class.

709~~~
Missed a top class Carrick all season. If he can pick up some form, stay fit, then I won't be worrying. Excellent player.

710~~~
LVG needs to be smart with how he uses him... can't overplay him, and needs to keep him fresh for important fixtures.

I don't trust LVG to do this competently.

711~~~
Urged players around him to pass him the ball and was trying to get into the front three quickly. Something Morgan desperately, desperately needs to improve on.

Yep, something about Schneiderlin has to play crap to cover for Fellaini...

712~~~
We need him in our home fixtures to get straight into the opposition back four. Too much dilly dallying without him!

713~~~
Great to have him back. Schneiderlin and Fellaini can't string a decent forward pass between them.

Who will be our next Carrick?

714~~~
Completely changes the way team plays.

715~~~
Needed those minutes tonight, we really need to be finding a younger version of him that can move as well as pass nicely.

716~~~
He wasn't playing much before he got injured was he?

717~~~
In some ways, he's the player we're most desperate to find a like-for-like replacement for (in so far as that's possible.) Fantastic player, who I think will be appreciated even more once he's left us.

718~~~
He's still comfortably our best midfielder. He'll be sorely missed when he's gone.

719~~~
Good cameo. Was a good time to bring him on too.

720~~~
I really do wish Fergie had bought a proper midfielder to play alongside him during his prime years (2009-13), think it would have helped in the CL (think we would have at least had a better shot at Barca).

Carried our midfield for years. Shame hes 34 and not 24.

721~~~
We haven't got another midfielder that plays the obvious simple pass like he does

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/cc7c" width="560"></iframe>

722~~~
Still easily our best CM. If he remains fit all season and is used intelligently, we're golden.

723~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

724~~~
Great to have him back!

725~~~
I'm glad to see him back, he can be important for us the remaining of the season... 
When does he finish contract? Do you think he will continue in the club next season?

726~~~
I think he has too.

727~~~
Hope he does...  If fit hes valuable,  and a new manager could find great use of him..  Great player..

728~~~
Been saying it for sometime that I think this is his last year with us.

729~~~
He has the confidence to play the simple forward pass, it is not something van Gaal forbids. But it is easier to play the sideway or backpass to keep posession, while Carrick does it with his forward passing. Schneiderlin, Fellaini and even Schweini to an extent could do that too and should do that more regularly, but they are quite simply afraid.

730~~~
Look at Carricks position in relation to Fellaini. He's drifted right over to that side of the pitch to affect play. 

After Carrick takes his first touch, he's got 3 progressive passes in Martial, Mata and Blind(?) as well Rooney, yet he opts to play the more difficult one into Martial.

If that was Schneiderlin he would have been about 7-8 yards deeper and more central, pretty much standing in the centre circle. His likely passing options would have been forward to Rooney, sideways to Verela or back to Smalling. And knowing Schneiderlin, he'd have picked the easy one back to Smalling.

731~~~
It's the right time, we kept Scholes on rather than finding a younger player who can pass it creatively but also cover the ground with mobility and not leave his CM partner doing too much, Carrick's at this point now IMO.

732~~~
I can't see him playing for another club so may be he wants to retire because of the constant injuries.

733~~~
I think he needs to be kept on in a coaching capacity.

To be able to hold the midfield the way he does and get the team playing is invaluable. He almost does the job of two players and I think he'd be a big help in us moulding the next Carrick, Busquets, Alonso etc.

734~~~
He's getting old, but I'd probably rather he played on crutches than our current midfield. How can we spend like £100 million or some shizzle like that for it to get actively worse?

735~~~
I thought Schneiderlin was much better on the ball at Southampton than what he has shown so far. He certainly wasn't getting by because Wanyama was some kind of a special play maker out there. It will be interesting how we move forward because Schweinsteiger is not a long term option even if he regains health and form and Herrera/Pereira are more attacking midfielders than deep lying play makers. I guess a lot would depend on the next manager but it still bothers me how Sir Alex never made a move for Modric when he was playing at Spurs.

736~~~
I and a number of others would disagree.

Modric has also said that we tried to sign him.

737~~~
LVG seems to hold him in high regard, I would have thought we would want him around regardless of playing

738~~~
Not every players needs to remain at the club in a coaching role! It would be nice for a change to have a player just retire.

739~~~
That wouldn't be a change, that would be the majority of players that retire.

740~~~
I absolutely agree

741~~~
His passing range makes us a much more dangerous team. Replacing him should be number one priority.

742~~~
See, you can play well next to Fellaini.

He's a difference maker

743~~~
His passing is great but several times Stoke have just strolled through midfield with such a lack of mobility in there for us, I'd get Schneiderlin or Herrera on to add some legs alongside him.

744~~~
He's been our worst player, skinned easily, slipped in midfield and a terrible header in our own box all put us in difficulty.

745~~~
Wut? Defensively he is far from great, mostly because of physical battles but his passing makes a complete difference to this team. When on form still easily our best midfielder, at 35.

746~~~
I was about to say that he is such a great player. The way he finds players with such ease is impressive. He has slipped a couple of times, but even world class Gerrard did that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Get him playing next to Schneiderlin instead of that player who is neither playing as midfielder or attacker, and Carrick will not have to try and hold a midfield on his own, again. Funny how people complained on how Carrick had to play in a midfield two under Ferguson. Now he has to play a midfield on his own.

747~~~
This play we are seeing today is much to the effect of Carrick.

748~~~
Welcome back Carrick!

749~~~
I've got to admit, I'd probably go along with this, but everyone else has been great.

That said, no doubt we've looked a lot better today on the day he's come back in to the team. Maybe its a coincidence, maybe not.

750~~~
Yes, I'd say he is easily most influential player to our play. Of course he can be bad, but when he's good he's good.

751~~~
His positive passing at the start set the tone for the half I thought.

The whole team looks more confident knowing he's there to pass to

752~~~
It's his first start after injury and I'm sure he'll get better but it's baffling how he can do no wrong with some people.

753~~~
Give this man a five year contract. A 40 year old Carrick is probably the best possible replacement of the 30 year old Carrick.
Finding the elixir of life should be our top priority, it's slightly more realistic.

754~~~
Such a calming presence.

755~~~
How anyone can think he wasn't good to great tonight is beyond me.

756~~~
We are miles better with him in the team.

757~~~
Dire need of a replacement in the summer. Could have another Scholes situation on our hands.

758~~~
I gave him a 6, definitely didn't think he was any better than that.

759~~~
Good on the ball but the midfield was the one concern for me today, when we don't have the ball you can just run through it most of the time, no ground coverage or mobility in there.

760~~~
I gave him my MOTM because I'm bored of giving it to Martial every week. I put the majority of credit from tonight's performance on his return.

761~~~
It's a priority to actually get his heir right in the Summer, it's the simple forward passes that we've been missing to unlock the game.

762~~~
Hard to believe its not Scholes...

763~~~

764~~~
I don't really get how though... I mean, we were obviously miles, miles better then we have been in the league in god knows how long... and a fundamental reason for that was how quickly we were getting the ball to our forward players in dangerous positions... and we could do that because Carrick a) didn't spend an eternity on the ball, often taking 1 or 2 touches and getting rid of the ball quickly, and with purpose, b) had the passing range to put excellent balls into our forward players and c) was constantly looking for forward passes.

Not only that, he was constantly moving into space ahead of whoever had the ball... a recurring theme of his play was going for the quick one two around his man before spreading the ball out into a dangerous area. It was excellent, forward thinking movement that constantly put us on the front foot.

765~~~
We need him (and hopefully Basti) fit for the majority of the rest of the season now. Mostly so they can rotate and keep em both fresh (how we were doing early in the season which was working decent).

766~~~
Amazing.

767~~~
Thought he was really good, his range of passing is excellent and he plays it forward and with pace. He defines our attacks.

768~~~
I gave him a 7 but I always seem to score 1 point less then the rest of Caf, so call it an 8. 

His influence on games is massively under appreciated.

d) was not hiding from passes
e) was not needing 20 yards of space in every direction before accepting the ball
f) was not positioning himself 5 yards behind Smalling

769~~~
People who don't rate him either have never played the game at a decent sort of level, or are just completely clueless.

By far our best midfielder still.

770~~~
Yep, all bang on... I actually specifically want to mention the fact that he wasn't hiding from passes, but forgot... so cheers!

771~~~
That's all well and good but after signing Bastian, Morgan and Herrera, it still seems he needs replacing..

772~~~
Passing and positioning is a masterclass. The only time he's found wanting is when pressed.

773~~~
Give him MOTM. Controlled the game for me. Desperately need to find a replacement because, like I said before, we have no one like him, and to be fair, his type of player is pretty hard to find.

774~~~
Impressive.

775~~~
Because... performance or age?

776~~~
I think Blind might mature into the type..

777~~~
Really like Blind

778~~~
Age obviously.

779~~~
Okay.. Just think as long as he capable of performing better than the young ones he should start, the same applies to young players as well. Not playing him because he might not be the same player next season, whilst this one is slipping away is daft.

780~~~
The pass out from the back to Darmian leading to the 2nd goal - that's what he brings and what we lack when we have Schneiderlin in there. The latter would have just looked at a short pass in that situation but, Carrick has the vision and ability to make those forward passes that get us going. Hopefully Schneiderlin takes the time to learn from Carrick because that deep midfielder players such an important role in getting us moving forward on top of the defensive side of the game.

781~~~
It's more about us being proactive than doing it to late like we did with Scholes.

782~~~
It's amazing how he is still our best playmaking central midfielder after buying 5 cm ( Fellaini,  Blind,  Herrera, Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger ). Noone else has his ability to play simple vertical passes to feet to the open attackers.  

We either need to but yet another cm playmaker like Modric (not him per se, somebody like him who plays in midfield 2 and is a playmaker) or play Herrera there and get a playmaker like Silva or Isco to replace mata and to be the creative fulcrum.

783~~~
Given he's about 35 he has his flaws and will be inconsistent but his passing is irreplaceable in our squad. A winger and a replacement for him must be top of our wishlist in the summer.

784~~~
Next summer we must get replacing him next summer completely spot on. Even just off full match fitness he is so critical to our play.

785~~~
Are you pretending these things didnt happen in the first half then? Doesn't surprise me, much better in the 2nd though.

786~~~
---------Carrick---------
-----Morgan--Herrera---

Sure, sign an understudy in the summer. But in the big games, he's still our most important player imo.

787~~~
it's actually in the 2nd half where he showed some slippy moments, it actually surprises nobody given we've known everything about him

788~~~
As I said the 3 moments I mentioned happened, I didn't make it up, they all put us in a pretty sticky situation too, the reaction of it was say Depay or Fellaini making these error would've been wildly different.

789~~~
When he's on form, he's just a superb player. His form and fitness will be crucial for us reaching top 4

790~~~
I'm afaraid he will struggle against Chelsea though, especialy if we play the same team. Him and Fellaini aren't the most mobile combo in midfield. Stoke didn't create us problems because they didn't press us properly and Crouch was a joke. It won't be the same at SB.

791~~~
He played well but before people get carried away remember he played against Bournemouth, Norwich and Stoke when we lost 3 in a row. Him playing doesn't mean we win or even create chances, he is quite inconsistent. When he is on form he makes a big difference though.

792~~~
been saying it for time, replacing his passing in midfield is vital for us. it adds so much to our game, someone like Gundogan or Kroos would be great.

793~~~
When was he getting skinned easily?

As for criticising a guy for slipping... I mean come on, it was pretty wet... anyone can slip over.

The header in our box, if it's the one I was thinking off, was a contested header and not exactly a gimmie, but I might be wrong on that. Regardless, failing to clear our lines at the first time of asking was a recurring theme throughout our team - not just reserved for Carrick.

Ultimately though, the fact that you would focus on these 3 things - 2 of which were isolated incidents, and 1 of which I'm not sure even happened, and completely disregard the huge contribution he made to the fact that we actually played at a higher tempo, seems like a pretty one-eyed view of his performance.

794~~~
It's Carrick, it happened last game aswell, he played a good pass and it was decried that no other player in our team was capable of playing such a pass, despite Blind doing it weekly all season and possibly to better effect. He's hugely overrated by some on this forum (as well as being underrated by others), that's not to say he isn't a great player who improves us when he's playing but for some he could do no wrong. It happened, a few mentioned him being skinned in the match day thread, the header was uncontested - he misjudged it and actually flicked it on into our 6 yard box. The slip occurred because he was flat footed when the ball came to him. As I had previously alluded to these things happen when a player is returning from injury, but why pretend it didn't happen because it's Carrick. If that was Memphis or Fellaini they would've been crucified in the match day thread.

The whole team played with better tempo and it wasn't just because Carrick was there (although of course he was part of that), we've got half a season of shit performances with Carrick in the team where tempo was non existent, the 3 losses on the bounce included.

795~~~
His passes from deep are sexual. 

My favourite United player since I first started following the team from 06/07

796~~~
People mention all sort of shit in a match day thread... I still don't recall Carrick getting skinned easily however.

Anyway, nobody pretends they didn't happen (apart from me) but people forgive them because they weren't big deals in relation to his giant positive contribution to our game. You literally said he was our worst player in the first half... which is baffling considering his presence in the team directly influenced our up-turn in performance level. The whole team played with a better tempo and Carrick was one of the main players for setting that tempo. The fact that he was on the ball more then anyone else illustrates this.

And Blind plays good passes from the back because he's got time and space to do so, Carrick plays good, quick, incisive passes from midfield when he's not got time. That's the difference for me... but regardless, most people have been saying that none of our other midfielders this season can pass a ball like Carrick.

797~~~
You forget how important he is for us, but Carrick showed it again last night. Need to keep him fit for the rest of the season, key player for us. Just makes others around him play better.

798~~~
Yes he was in the team and obviously contributed to it but as LVG stated post match there was a intentional change to the way we approached the game, before Carrick had even touched the ball it was planned to play with a higher tempo and more aggressively from the off to get that vital early goal. These weren't small incidents, the header in particular could've cost us. When you balance these in with that he did right, it's hardly a stretch to say he was our worst outfield player in that first half. I didn't even say he played poorly, just every one of our players played wonderfully in those first 45 minutes. 

That being said I hope he continues in midfield, once he's got a few more games under his belt hopefully these mistakes will be eased out and he can really start dictating games for us, Chelsea will certainly be a tough test.

799~~~
What interview was this?

I think I've seen all his interviews from yesterday and he said quite the opposite. That he has not asked for anything different but we took our chances and scored an early goal which gave us confidence. And that team has always had this kind of performance in them.

800~~~
My favourite United player since 2010. Put him in the tier below Xavi, when it comes to midfielders. Might be overselling him a bit there, but he's genuinely one of the most intelligent players I've seen.

801~~~
I think that's fair. He's not in that Xavi/Pirlo/Scholes elite, but the next one down is fair, at worst the one below that.

802~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzk7RZYJXyg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

803~~~
Some quality moments on the ball but once they started to pile the pressure on he disappeared and couldn't turn the midfield around, which is understandable at his age.

804~~~
When we were on top he completely bossed it.

805~~~
If Carrick moved any slower he'd be travelling back in time.

806~~~
Needs to retire, as said about 100 times this season. 

Passing is lovely at times, as usual but you need more from a midfielder. Pretty sure Giggs could still whip balls around like he does if you gave him enough time so it's not all that impressive.

807~~~
We need his passing ability, still by far our best passer.

808~~~
Still our best midfield player. The difference in our play with him in the team is obvious.

809~~~
Yet somehow no-one else in our team manages to play those passes. Strange that. At the end of the day our build up play is far more fluid with him there. That's far more important than him being caught in possession a couple of times a game.

810~~~
he always struggles when he's closed down, closing down is a part of modern football, his time has come, no matter how good passer he is. He is certainly no scholes and his mobility is about the same at the end of Scholeses career..

811~~~
Ah yeah, he's been picking out any Sunderland player he wants, worst player on the pitch.

812~~~
As usual, his passing is massively overrated in terms of it's significance.

813~~~
Been garbage today, not as bad as Schneiderlin though.

814~~~
Hes forcing it too much today. Playing difficult passes to the forwards feet when he is surrounded by 3 players with back to goal is pointless. 
He needs to relax ffs.

815~~~
What the feck is going on with him today?

816~~~
That misplaced pass at the end pissed me off.

817~~~
That would be Blind.

818~~~
Ah, he'll play a decent ball in the second half and we'll be told no one else on the pitch is capable of it.

819~~~
Why is he getting so much stick? Nearly all of our play in the first half went through him.

820~~~
Not a chance.

821~~~
All those goals we've scored from those killer Carrick passes this season...

822~~~
When given absolutely no attention from an opposition midfielder.

If someone actually bothers to press Carrick and he messes up - then that's just bad luck or 'not his game'.

823~~~
He goes into hiding so often, that or he'll drop deeper and deeper until he'll be in line with the centrebacks just to get the time on the ball he needs.

824~~~
He is basically alone given how poor schneiderlin has been so far.

825~~~
Schneiderlin needs to feck off forward to give Carrick space to operate.

As it is Schneiderlin is crowding Carrick out and giving him one less option to pass forward.

826~~~
You only need to look at the number of games we've failed to score in with/without him to see its significance. Even if you just look in the league alone, its 5 goalless games when he didn't start vs. 2 goalless games with him. Or looked at another way, we've failed to score in ~40% of our league games when he didn't start vs. 17% of our games when he did. You can't seriously think that's a coincidence?

827~~~
Weird seeing the contrast in the opinions. I think Carrick has been awful.

828~~~
Nonsense he's been woeful. At least Schneiderlin has made the occasional tackle, even with our goal, Carrick fecks around with it in the middle and the progressive passes come from Blind and Schneiderlin.

829~~~
Dire today. The drop in performance has been huge.

830~~~
He's untouchable for so many in here, him being unable to pass over 4 yards is Schneiderlins fault apparently.

831~~~
Ok we get it. Calm the feck down and have a seat.

832~~~
And if the seat breaks I'll blame the table.

833~~~
Get your eyes tested then. Not my mistake. Don't quote me.

834~~~
Are you a goldfish or is your memory that bad?

835~~~
I think without him we have zero ability to pass between the lines. We basically need a younger more mobile version of him - unlike others I don't think it is impossible to find a player of his ilk but United make midfield signings look so hard.

836~~~
DDG saving Carricks arse there. Lost the ball Again in midfield.

837~~~
Well that might well be but if we're going to go down the statistics route (which some quite rightly are skeptical of - for the context in which they're used):
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/JA9g2vj.png?1" src="http://i.imgur.com/JA9g2vj.png?1"/>

Doesn't exactly suggest he's a key player. He's played plenty of games too to boost those stats.

838~~~
And this second half he's given the ball away almost every time he's got it. I'm sure that'll be Schneiderlin or Memphis' fault too

839~~~
That makes for painful reading for his sympathisers, Schneiderlin outperforms him in every aspect.

840~~~
Wow. Use "per 90 minutes" rather than "per game"  and it will show you how far Schneiderlin is behind Carrick.

841~~~
Both options are there for a reason. Stats of course don't tell you everything as I said when I posted that.

Don't think Carrick has been good at all this season and I was simply questioning this idea he's a key player. He really isn't. He needs replaced.

842~~~
Him and Schneiderlin together just isn't working. At least not in the setup that we play.

843~~~
It's not, too defensive whilst lacking creativity.

844~~~
And even then, they are not doing a good defensive job.

845~~~
He reminds me of Scholes in his last season chugging along in Yaya's dust in the derby, his passing is still good but I don't think he has the legs to cope with the press these days, it was always a weakness for him but now it's more so.

846~~~
This. His legs are gone sadly. We need to move on from him, quick!

847~~~
It's why repalcing him this summer is so crucial, as it's evident what we miss when he's not in the side on the ball, but the drawbacks are there as well and we need a player that has the passing and the ground coverage to play in there. Truth is the team needs 1 new player in each one of the spine positions bar keeper.

848~~~
Hes been our best midfielder this season, but yeah, he was poor today. TBH, hes at a stage where he should be a luxury player not one we rely on.

849~~~
He really struggled to get into the game today, misplacing passes, got skinned a couple of times and shoved off the ball quite frequently too.

850~~~
He might be our best midfielder when he actually turns up. In fact he is by some distance, but performances like today are just completely unacceptable really, and he's another one where it just happens too often.

You can't even put it down to his age because he's been at it since Moyes took over. He just has these games where he seems to think he's allowed to take 10 seconds longer than everyone else on the pitch to bother reacting to anything. He's 34, not 64. It's not an age thing.

A big part of our problem in recent years is we've gone from relying on players like Giggs, Keano, Scholes, Ronaldo, etc. as our backbone. Players who are made of the right stuff...to the likes of Carrick. A massive pansy who despite his obvious talent wouldn't win a thing if he didn't have other winners in the team to rely on. When it comes down to him, he melts or goes into a shell. 

And yeah, Schneiderlin was bad today which didn't help, but that doesn't stop Carrick from playing well under difficult circumstance. The reality is he was just shite aswell.

Which was a big problem really. Three things; He was taking far too long to play any kind of pass, he was playing the wrong pass half the time, and a lot of the passes were fecking awful. No part of it was anywhere near up to scratch. Mata was the one we should have been playing through but we couldn't get the ball to him in the first place.

851~~~
He's been just atrocious since returning from injury.

852~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/video" width="560"></iframe>

That's a dreadful pass. Last player in the team you'd expect that from too.

853~~~
He's been pretty shite all season, the fact we've spent about £80m on midfielders and it still affects us so much when he doesn't play well is laughable.

854~~~
Its look like he can't play game continues game. Need to manage his game time.

855~~~
Carrick + Herrera + Denmark = No.

*Equation correct as of 18/02/2016 18:55 GMT

856~~~
Awful.

857~~~
Let him leave on a free please.

858~~~
Really shit.

859~~~
The midfield is truly in an awful state.

860~~~
Please retire at the end of the season.

861~~~
At fault for both goals. Feck sake Michael.

862~~~
He looks like you could hear him creak when he moves, and in truth didn't look like he could be arsed tonight.

863~~~
Better than Schneiderlin though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's so poor.

864~~~
Course he has... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

865~~~
The only thing worse than his shithouse performance was his interview after the match.

I'm fecking sick of watching  Utd players mumbling apologies in interviews after the latest disgraceful performance. Carrick seems to have done loads in the last 3 years.

866~~~
Carrick was our best outfield player last season.

867~~~
He is 34 and playing in a 2 man midfield when he should be protected by 2 CM's in front of him or not being played at all.
It's simply bad management from LvG.

868~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/2812709/michael-carrick-considering-man-united-exit-sources" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Michael Carrick considering Man United exit over no new deal - sources</b></span></a>

869~~~
It is probably the best for all parties concerned. He can be very proud of his career with United, even if opposition fans don't really rate him that highly. It will be interesting if he does leave for Spain or somewhere abroad (Germany/Italy maybe?), I get the sense that it won't be. I'd hazard a guess that he'll go to Newcastle and finish his career (if they want him of course) there if we don't offer him a new deal. He doesn't really strike me as a player destined to be a great coach if I am being honest, but would be happy for him to impart his wisdom to the academy if he fancies his badges.

870~~~
*Cough* Yeah as I was saying...he's done. 

Bad passing so far, poor touches and stupid diving in. Might be in the wrong position but he's done.

871~~~
Time to call it a day Michael.

That attempt at a tackle was literally 5 yards off target.

872~~~
He's been bad overall since Fergie retired. 1 good game here and there isn't enough.

Been a great player for us, but he is done for imo.

873~~~
He's really tarnishing his reputation now, needs to retire. He just offers us nothing now, I would prefer to see TFM in there right now.

874~~~
He's finished.

875~~~
Sad but it does look like this is it for him. Great servant though.

876~~~
He seems to down tools the second the going gets the slightest bit tough.

He was alright last season, in a relatively decent season, and the first one to give up under Moyes. Mentally not here this season, either.

877~~~
At CB position, yes he is.

878~~~
Better in the second half... and better then Blind tonight (who was really poor).

879~~~
I don't think we can risk him and Blind together against Arsenal, it's like a tanker racing meet when it comes to getting turned around.

880~~~
He's just been woeful this season, didn't contribute anything to today's performance.

881~~~
As poor as Schneiderlin and Rojo were why on earth is one of our centre-backs, and tallest players, marking nobody for their goal? The slightest appetite to challenge for the ball and he gets in-between Welbeck and the goal.

882~~~
Carrick has been the worst player for us so far. He should be our leader on the pitch. Cannot believe the lack of calmness he shows when he has to take the lead.

883~~~
He is not a defender.

884~~~
He should be taken off for TFM in the second half, if he carries on in the same vein.

885~~~
Our worst player in teh first half, he better get his shit together or we're fecked.

886~~~
Because that's how the manager had them set up? Carrick is nowhere near being at fault for that goal. Schneiderlin turns his back on the bloody ball.

887~~~
Initially, yeah, maybe, but no manger sets the team up to stand around like statues and not react. He's within about 3 yards of Welbeck the slightest bit of awareness and he's challenging him in the air rather than watching him score and sticking his hand up hopefully.

888~~~
He's slow physically and generally slow in anticipating things. You saw it in midfield so he was never going to be any better at centre back. 

Hopefully we'll get through this.

889~~~
Good 2nd half defensively.

890~~~
Thought he looked really poor. It's to be expected since he's not a centre-back at all, but he just generally looked very immobile, uncomfortable, and confused at times.

891~~~
Even towards the end he cowered away from a ball that Varela came charging in to deal with.

892~~~
I think he could reasonably expect the people actually marking him to do it. There was already two players there. If he'd went to Welbeck and somebody else had scored people would be crying.

893~~~
What a fecking performance

894~~~
wow some of the comments. I thought he played really well for the entire game. He isnt a CB, considering that alone he did well.

895~~~
Good performance from the old man.

896~~~
He did very, very well today.

I feared the worst but he hardly put a foot wrong. Read the game well and intercepted loads. Really got us out of a tight spot today.

897~~~
People are morons. He'd a perfectly good game. Definitely better in the second half too.

898~~~
Tbf, it's hard to be horny at his age.

899~~~
The old man did well today given the circumstances

900~~~
I don't think thats reasonable at all. A player like Vidic, for example, would never die wondering in that situation. Expecting a player who's been around for as long as Carrick to be aware to the danger isn't unreasonable, nor is it unreasonable to assume that nominally our leader on the pitch today should take responsibility. 

Still, he performed better the second half.

901~~~
There were two players already there. To bundle in and make it three would've been idiotic. The responsibility is solely with the player who did a stupid little spin when the ball was in the air.

902~~~
What a second half from the old man. Could be the first time in ages that I've seen him take charge and lead.

903~~~
Looked really flat footed at times but held his position well, we were wise to sit deeper defensively in that half.

904~~~
Will miss this man when he's gone. Rio-eqsue performance today. 34 years old, slow as feck but holding the fort against Arsenal's speedy attackers just by reading the play.

905~~~
I can't believe people are blaming him for the first goal. 

Brilliant display from him - such a great reader of the game - even when he's out of position.

906~~~
He was great today. Thought himself and Daley would be murdered today but a very canny display from them both.

907~~~
Had a good game him. Started badly but got better as the game went on.

Surely he should get his testimonial game at the end of this year?

908~~~
Decent game, especially second half. Dont think he should be starting ahead of Morgan and Herrera in CM though. Maybe as an anchor behind them if we play three in the middle, but otherwise, coming on as a sub there.

909~~~
Not in the squad.

910~~~
Another poor showing, time to retire me thinks.

911~~~
He's become a real liability at set pieces this season. Strange.

912~~~
I thought he grew well after the red. The one good spell around 35 mins we had he was imperious - distributing, recycling, intercepting.

But agreed - he is fading in general both passing and defensively.

913~~~
He keeps things ticking over today which is welcome but at least a few times I've noted him struggling defensively. Hopefully doesn't cost us in the second half.

914~~~
What do you mean ticking over? He's dallied on the ball and played the simple pass, if this was Schneiderlin he would be getting hammered, but because it's Carrick he's kept things ticking over.

915~~~
Thought he was terrible for about 30 mins. Improved after the red but mostly because he can now afford to be slow as feck on the ball.

Not good enough for us. Probably best if he moves on. I prefer him at the back, too.

916~~~
No energy in his play. Was never the most dynamic player and he's now almost 35.

917~~~
Woah, you're preaching to the converted, look at my previous posts on Carrick. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

918~~~
Time to retire Michael.

919~~~
He looks off the pace and laboured. My favourite United player but this performance is a piss take.

920~~~
Playing with 10 men does not suit him, especially at his age. Not his fault at all.

Should have been subbed, not Herrera.

921~~~
Yes it's a shame but it comes to us all. Been a fantastic player over the years though.

922~~~
There's slow and there's Michael Carrick.

He's been brilliant for us, a really likeable player, but I think he's getting towards the Gary Neville stage where his complete lack of mobility is becoming too much.

923~~~
Needs to retire, unfortunately. There's nothing left.

924~~~
He is finished. Been a great servant to the club but needs to be moved on in Summer, along with quite a few of these mediocre players.

925~~~
I am a big fan of Carrick, but he needs to go. His legs are gone, and he's not got the character or personality to lead a young side.

926~~~
Hes been awful. Cant believe he stayed on and Herrera went off.

927~~~
Needs to go. Still cannot believe it was Herrera who was taken off for Morgan when a win was an absolute necessity for us despite 10 men. Carrick has been woeful for some time now.

928~~~
Thank for the service but Just retire asap you're done.

929~~~
Needed to be moved on LAST summer

930~~~
There is no way United should consider giving him a new deal.

931~~~
His not finished, still can give something, depending on the game.

Not his fault, Mata got sent off. LVG should have subbed him.

932~~~
When we need someone who can play a forward pass Carrick is just concerned about his pass completion %, absolute disgrace the amount of the times he played the ball backwards.

He must have had a side bet with someone about how many times he could pass the ball to DDG.

933~~~
Aye he can continue to offer us massive anxiety in every match. Id prefer he didn't though.

934~~~
Yeah he could become a useful player for the Under 21's

935~~~
New deal for him as assistent manager of the kitchen staff.

936~~~
Don't get why Herrera gets subbed off and Carrick stays on, probably because of his leadership and because the captain has to play 90 minutes.

937~~~
He's been finished for a long time. Shouldn't be getting anything like the game time he does. Spent 30 million on each of Schneiderlin and Herrera and he seems to be preferred to both. fecking ridiculous.

938~~~
Carrick is a walking vagina.

939~~~
Really struggled today.

940~~~
Knee jerk reactions. I still believe he has something and still will until we have a player of his passing ability.

I agree he played shit. It was obvious he would have the second we went down to 10 men. 

If you want to blame someone then blame LVG.

941~~~
Not knee-jerk at all. I've been personally complaining of how shite Carrick has played all season. In modern PL football the man is useless due to his lack of physical presence and playing the game as slow as a wheelchair user.

942~~~
Dont think he was half as bad as some are making out.

943~~~
To be honest I'd rather him at CB then midfield from now on.

944~~~
Carrick is done. Vying with Rooney for first place on my sellsellsell-wishlist

945~~~
Too slow on the ball and virtually stationary off it, he's done and there's nothing wrong with that at the age he is, this isn't Serie A. We've been doing too much of this "He can still play 30 minutes here and there" type of thing for too long, we need to let him go in the summer.

946~~~
Never convinced me as someone who could step up to what's needed in terms of leadership. Blatantly obvious now he will never be able to. Think if it wasn't for playing next to Scholes for so many years he'd have been exposed for what he is years ago.

947~~~
First time I have watched him and thought it is all over.

948~~~
Last few weeks of his Utd career I'd imagine now.

Been a great player for us but he's finished now.

949~~~
Either keep him around as bench player for experience or sell him.

950~~~
I am a huge Carrick fan, but he looked awful out there. So immobile. And he constantly slows down our attacks. Shouldn't be given a new contract.

951~~~
Would rather have had TFM in the middle than him. At least he would have run around and brought some energy, Carrick's performance was an absolute joke.

952~~~
That's basically his role already. He's just physically done and unless protected by a mobile 3 man midfield, there's no need for him anymore.

953~~~
Really? First time? I think you could have said the same at times last season and this. He has an odd performance now and again but consistency has been gone for some time now. I vividly remember him getting the ball in the first half today from I think Darmian on the right. He was just inside West Brom's half. He takes the ball then stands completely still. Looks around then squares it to Blind or Smalling. Closest West Brom player was maybe 15-20 yards when he received the ball. What made this even more frustrating was that everyone I could see in front of him was completely standing still, not moving anywhere.

954~~~
Yeah. He has looked slow in mind and body sometimes but most games I see glimpses of the prime Carrick with the odd incisive pass, interception or just a little bit of calm play. There was none of that today. He just looked out of ideas, playing back at every opportunity. He looked like he wasn't up to it.

955~~~
Worst player on the pitch. It's no coincidence that our best games were with Herrera and Schneidelin in central midfield.

956~~~
Bad performance. Still a legend though. Could be time to move one. Unsure about this.

957~~~
Sadly his time here is done. His legs have gone and he gets put under pressure too easily. When that happens his passing has now become atrocious . Great player .... Time to move on.

958~~~
Carricks famed composure on display again there.

959~~~
Used to be a huge admirer, but he is now a spineless coward.

960~~~
Just repeating ourselves now. 

He's awful. His Gary Neville moment has come and gone but he's still being wheeled out there.

961~~~
really bad place to take a touch like that! My word.

He knew though!! He knew!

962~~~
Honestly, for all his ability I think being spineless is always an accusation you could lay against him.

963~~~
Robben vs United, 2010. I've held it against him ever since I must be honest. Some watch that goal and admire Robben's technique. I watch it and shake my head at Carrick falling on his arse in front of him (instead of standing tall and blocking the shot).

In the present day he's done it this season plenty of times. Against Wolfsburg he was responsible for their third I remember, being ragdolled in the box.

964~~~
He has just been dreadful this season. To think last year he was one of the biggest reasons why we got top 4.

965~~~
As i've said again and again.

He's a walking vagina. The sloppy grandma version.

966~~~
I agree, it's a fair accusation. That coupled with his legs completing going makes him a massive liability.

Have to shift him in the summer.

967~~~
Always a weak link

968~~~
He's finished.

969~~~
Bet he gets a new contract.

970~~~
Yeah it's always better and perfectly rational to hold a few goals against a player who's given years of good service.

971~~~
What the hell are you on about? 

I can appreciate Carrick's good points without forgetting his negatives too. I just don't rate the guy like a lot of United supporters do. 

As I've always thought - underrated by the opposition but stupidly overrated by our own.

972~~~
I just don't know what he was trying to do, yes everyone makes mistakes but 99% of the time you can see what they meant to do, but that I don't have a scooby doo

973~~~
Someone was going to get caught out overplaying it from the back (we'd threatened to do it a number of times) and he was the man it fell upon.

I said this in the matchday thread... blame is certainly on him for fecking it up... but LVG wanted us to play it out from the back, so hey, guess what happens...

974~~~
I'm talking about you holding a mistake against a player for 6 years. That should be fairly obvious.

975~~~
Thanks for the service Michael.

976~~~
Get rid.

977~~~
I blame LvG and will blame him for every mistake from now till the end.

978~~~
A shocking mistake from a player that is clearly finished.

979~~~
Cya.

980~~~
Don't say that.. the lubes coming out in the Rooney household as we speak.

981~~~
Of course he fecking won't.

982~~~
We probably should get rid. The only problem is that based on this season at least 10 other players should be let go before him.

983~~~
He's done. Great servant, but he's been poor since Fergie retired.

984~~~
Wtf was he doing.

985~~~
He had a 5 minute spell when he came on where he hit a couple of nice, progressive passes, then it turned to shit again.

986~~~
He was great last season in fairness, it's just that he was injured for half the season.

987~~~
He was great in that run we had.

Besides that, thought he was a bit meh. Was poor in the Moyes season too.

I am one of his biggest fans too. Need to move on from him.

988~~~
Another big game, another mistake, another goal. Clear it. Clear the fecking ball.

989~~~
Awful mistake tonight which probably costs us the tie. 

I will still enjoy watching him for as long as he is with us.

990~~~
I've been a big fan of his over the years but we need to let him go in the summer. He's been poor this season, keeps coming out for interviews and coating other players off but he needs to take a good hard look at himself because he's been just as bad if not worse than most.

991~~~
Very costly mistake, I like him but clearly near the end of his paying career

992~~~
1st time I feel he's done.

993~~~
He's been awful this season and it continued tonight.

994~~~
Not his fault he was put in a three man defence in a big game, but really, he's done. He's off in summer.

995~~~
This

Please tell me he didn't give another of those "Ermmm, it's not good enough. Ermmmm we hope ta dooo beta'" interviews after that performance.

996~~~
Cutting players loose and replacing them with worse players was the mistake after Moyes. Carrick should be kept, but not relied upon. Use him in his proper position and he is perfectly serviceable. LVG has set him up for failure where SAF would have used him wisely like he did Scholes in his declining years.

I think we should be adding to the team, not subtracting from it. United have a massive budget, so having a small squad as LVG has done makes absolutely no sense. Fergie managed to bring through youth and rotate a big squad at the same time.

997~~~
At least he's got the guts to do an interview.  But I do agree with you whatever comes out of the players' mouths I don't really listen to anymore.  It's just droning hypocritical self-serving manure.  But what else could we expect.

Carrick has been a good servant of the club, not a great but will be remembered fondly.  He needs to go somewhere else however for that last paycheck.  It was a mistake giving him the vice captain role.  Maybe he has been an influence in the dressing room (all evidence to the contrary) but on the field performance just is not there.

998~~~
I have stopped listening to interviews a while ago. They are just so uninteresting, specially the ones with LVG. I can understand reading transcripts but hearing them speak with these prepared full of clichés sentences is too much for me.

999~~~
Really showed his lack of experience there, hopefully he'll learn from this in years to come as the veterans in Fosu-Mensah would know to clear it at first instance.

1000~~~
Blame LVG and his smug tactic by putting him at the back. He can spray the balls around the pitch but i feel we need more than that. Thanks for the service to the club but he as to go in the Summer.

1001~~~
Made the mistake but we improved massively when he came on . Still our best midfielder.  By a distance too.

1002~~~
Playing in the middle of a back 3 is not his thing. Still, we improved in the 2nd half, until his error.

1003~~~
He might still be our best CM, but that's not a compliment it's an indictment of how poor our other CM's are IMO.

1004~~~
Might aswell be a RedCafe meme at this stage. It's bollocks.

1005~~~
I wasn't saying he was, in truth none of our CM's have been very impressive this season.

1006~~~
I love Michael and he has been a great servant but surely either retire or China in the summer?

1007~~~
Gosh hes so crap. Plays in slow mo.

1008~~~
He's finished.

1009~~~
Was woeful in that first half but much better in the second.

1010~~~
It seems not only his feet are slow but also his brain at times.

1011~~~
He wants way too much time on the ball these days, he made 2 or 3 decent passes in the second half but often dallied on it and slowed down any forward momentum, plus he's stationary when ran at, Noble, Lanzini and near the end Antonio just ghosted past our midfield.

1012~~~
Another game, another crap performance.

1013~~~
The argument for Schneiderlin over Carrick is to be seen in games like today.

Schneiderlin doesn't have the poise and ball playing ability (that we have seen as of yet) of Carrick but by being simply twice the player physically he offers us to move up and down the pitch at a much faster rate. I don't care for all of Carrick's experience and passing because he's not delivering it to a high enough standard to compensate his other liabilities.

Is he that bad that he should leave the squad? No actually and the same could be said of players like Young and Valencia. If used correctly, they could be invaluable in a team needing leadership and quality but atm it doesn't look likely that we have a manager capable of building a progressive, consistent squad let alone needing to incorporate flawed players.

So it's a simple case of cut loose and use that iniative to rebuild (and give chances to the future youth).

1014~~~
it's just that he has a good game here and there and everybody starts to think that he's back and can play another season. No he can't at the highest level. He could still be usefull for some lower league team for a season or two but if you want to play at the highest level it's very tough at 34/35. Mobility is what he massively lacks and if his passing is off like today he's quite useless. Lets give his place to TFM

1015~~~
well I bet Schneiderlin wouldn't do worse with the ball today.. Everybody highlights how good passer Carrick is but he's been quite shit lately with the ball as well.. actually the only season he seemed world class passer was Fergie's last season since that he barely showed that level of passing but it's really hard to judge if it dropped a level or not when the ability slowly fades away over time.. It's hard to believe it's not Scholes. No it is easy. Michael should retire

1016~~~
Would be shocked if he's given a new deal. Time to move on.

1017~~~
I mean, he was clearly decent in the second half and no worse then anyone else in the first... So let's be reasonable at least.

1018~~~
He's our longest serving player (on the pitch, and second overall), has spent 10+ years playing in the PL and is vastly experienced, yet plays like he's just been introduced into football. 

As our play-maker, sitting in the centre of the park, and the player who will see more of the ball than anyone else, he has to control the game. It's his job to set the tempo, yet he fails every time. The time he spends dithering on the ball is ridiculous. 

Our best performances have come when he's not in the midfield. In fact, we're a better team with him in defense, where we have two very good players on the ball and he isn't being relied upon to control the game.

1019~~~
With Bastian back, I'd bench him and use him as a sub  again.

1020~~~
In the first half, no one was moving for him at all... So it was no wonder he spent so much time on it.

On the rare occasions anyone did move or make a run he generally gave it to them, but it's pretty unfair to pin that on him. In the second half, when everyone could be arsed and decided to actually move around, he was able to spend less time on the ball and played much better for it.

1021~~~
He has always had good forward passes in his locker. It's the tempo in his square passing that often lets us down. Slow passes, straight to players. Doesn't like to move quickly off the ball, so he never gives the option of 1-2 pass to break up play. Sets the tempo for the whole attack.

1022~~~
He's always needed too much time on the ball and that's what's kept him out of the great player bracket for me. He's not a particularly brave player and it's that lack of confidence that has him dithering. I've never been convinced by him I'm afraid.

1023~~~
Which is half the problem. If people aren't creating space or movement you need to be able to advance with the ball and force somebody to close you down. 

Carrick never pushes far enough forward to attract players out of their defensive area, so instead we just recycle the ball wide.

He is just about usable in a 433 but he lacks the speed to be able to stop any counters, so it's sort of pointless him being there apart from passing.

1024~~~
He really is done. Not a single decent forward pass today.

1025~~~
Not if you ask his BBF Michael Owen.

1026~~~
Still think he's one of the best midfielders in the league and the best midfielder at the club, but only if he has a good set of legs partnering him in midfield. We need to get him to sign that contract asap.

1027~~~
Bravo, you nearly got me there

1028~~~
Sadly time has caught up with him, I still think he could do a job if you had right players around him, playing along side fellaini is stupid they don't compliment each other at all.

1029~~~
He could play like Pirlo.. he has the talent .. just need players like Vidal,Pogba around himm

1030~~~
Some decent passes but surely we can get a player in who can do that and also run and compete physically, neither him or moppy could get out to fill in space when the fullbacks moved forwards, and the way Can took the ball off him at the end was candy from a baby.

1031~~~
He was by a huge distance our best midfielder today. It's the reason we were able to build any attacks at all. His passing is still there. I was really disappointed with his last game but this was so much better, and against a team that successfully pressed every other player.

1032~~~
Agree with both assessments. Not very mobile anymore but can still pick his passes well. We seemed more deflated when he came off, the impetus wasn't there anymore.

1033~~~
He ran the game. Shame that he was partnered with Fellani.

1034~~~
People in the match day thread are weird, knives out for him, he was okay today, was hardly a problem.

1035~~~
When he went off it went to pot.

He wasn't. It was a 433.

1036~~~
Thought he was better today and helped set a decent tempo in the first half, still has too many flaws (mostly physical) to be basing our game around but don't feel tonight is one of those games when he can really be criticised (or lauded for that matter).

1037~~~
Yeah, I criticised him in the first half, but I thought he was OK in the second. However, he's too fecking slow and lets everyone walk past him.

1038~~~
Given that Lingard was the 10 I rather beg to differ. But you are just being pedantic. Fellani was the other midfielder playing in the middle of the park for us tonight. I don't mean they were constantly at each other's side giving each other high fives every time they completed a pass.

1039~~~
The only one to me that wanted to move the ball forward in both half. I'll give him MOTM.

1040~~~
Did well. Midfield wasn't the problem today, it was composure in the final third, which can be expected from a young attack needing to score 3 or 4.

1041~~~
Both Fellaini and Lingard were pushed high up tonight, and took turns dropping deep for the ball, whilst Carrick sat. Mata was on the wing, but given the licence to drop into midfield, also. 

Late on in the second half, however, it seemed that Lingard went to number 10, with Fellaini and Rashford up top.

1042~~~
Much better performance today, one of our better players on the night

1043~~~
Yeah I thought he was decent, one of our best. His passing seemed back to a good level, it's just his mobility that is permanently gone.

1044~~~
Feel much better about him still having a future with us after tonight. Think he has a role to play in certain games. Would be nice to see him in the pivot with 2 of Herrera/Bast/Schneiderlin in front of him.

1045~~~
We did feck all after he went off.

1046~~~
We conceded 0 goals...

In all seriousness, we werent exactly lighting the place up when he was on.

1047~~~
His vision and brain is there. You could see it with some of his passes. The problem is his legs are gone. I also had a feeling he didnt trust our defenders (rightfully so). He kept dropping back to get the ball (sometimes the deepest man).

I have no problem him doing that, but it would work if we had defenders around him who could move or control the ball or wingbacks who could stretch the play for Carrick to pick out.

1048~~~
I thought he did really really well. This season hasn't been the best for him so far, but I think he was brilliant and he was excellent at being captain too (I remember him barking orders for a couple of set plays). He clearly tired towards the end just like everyone else (Gave the ball away cheaply to Origi iirc), but I really hope we don't feck around and let him go on a free. He deserves a contract extension and then slowly can be integrated into the coaching side of the game as well.

1049~~~
We can't be carrying him and Schweinsteiger next year, no more extending old players careers, the legs are gone and we need to move on with a squad of players all capable of putting in the yards and playing 90 twice a week.

1050~~~
Thought he was shit tbh

1051~~~
Phenomenal game from our captain today. Completely bossed the middle of the pitch in the first half and was vital in defense in the second half.

1052~~~
credit where it's due, he's been fantastic this game!

1053~~~
He was brilliant. Close between him and Smalling for man of the match.

1054~~~
Yeah I thought he was good. Putting himself about all over the pitch and always showed composure on the ball.

1055~~~
He was fantastic. Manage him well and pick his games and he could play for more years.

1056~~~
Thought he was great.

1057~~~
Captain. Leader. Legend.

1058~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1059~~~
Good game but needs to call it a day after this season

1060~~~
Brilliant today. 

Took control of that midfield and made sure we kept our nerve.

1061~~~
No he doesn't

Under fergie we always had experienced players

He will be very valuable as a squad player next season. To bring on for last few mins and start the odd game here and there

1062~~~
Thought he was poor, got caught on the ball in the first half and on two occasions just stood off Yaya, once giving him all the time in the world to shoot on the edge of the box and the other allowing him to cross for Aguero's header, he didn't even bother sticking a leg out.

1063~~~
In the context of the whole season, his legs are gone. We can't expect him to be much better than this next year. When it's time it's time, sadly!

1064~~~
masterclass.

1065~~~
I thought he played really well after conceding that terrible corner where he controlled the ball with his chest. More of it please

1066~~~
one of his better games today, can agree with you lot here but would it look different game if Lingard and Schneiderlin didn't play midfield which helped him immensely but it kinda drained us in attack..

1067~~~
Much better today. Pace of the game suited him down to ground as it went on.

1068~~~
Been harsh on him this season but  he had a good game today. Seems to against Yaya anyway.

1069~~~
Apart from his distribution (the highlights were the balls to Rashford down the channels) he made a few decent last-ditch challenges too. Of course positionally he remains great.
Wish we could get a replacement of his quality. Neither of the Sch guys are close in the DM+playmaker role.

1070~~~
Provides us with so much stability. Club legend through and through.

1071~~~
I liked how much organizing he was doing with the young players, unusual for him as he's never been a vocal player. He also used the ball well but when we don't have the ball he's a passenger. I think he's been an excellent player for us but I still think he has to go in the summer, we need someone that can play his role on the ball but also run when we don't have it.

1072~~~
I don't think that's a fair criticism of him today... he really put in a shift and did some very good defensive work.

1073~~~
Rolled back the years! Nice to see him play like that before retirement.

1074~~~
Captain's performance today, loved how he was taking Martial and Rashford aside during the game and pointing out what runs they needed to make from time to time. I'd like to see him hold onto the armband even when Rooney returns.

1075~~~
Great performance again. We should give him another year, as a thank you at least.

1076~~~
There were several times where Aguero had loads of room to run off when he dropped deeper as Carrick couldn't move, most time Blind had to come rushing out co cover.

This is the kind of sentimentality that has gotten us in this mess IMO, his thank you is the millions he's made and the trophies he has won.

1077~~~
Could tell he was knackered, but he dug in and put in a solid display, especally in the second half. Captain's performance.

1078~~~
Get rid of Fellani bring in a new world class CM keep Carrick on the bench for special occasions. I see no problem at all.

1079~~~
That bench place should be taken up by a player that can come in and play 90 minutes for 5 games on the bounce and not miss a beat if needed, not a 35 year old who can barely run and is there to play 30 minutes and hope we don't have to use him regularly due to injury.

1080~~~
Don't worry we will have Schweinsteiger too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Two old crumblies = one great player.

1081~~~
They don't have a set of working legs between them. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1082~~~
Schweinsteiger looks about 50 I can't believe he is 2 years younger than me!

1083~~~
Excellent game but, definitely is a case of legs have gone. His contract is up and we've got an elder midfielder in Schweiny already. Need to bring in another top midfielder preferably but, even if not, Blind needs to take his place after being replaced by a top defender.

Great great servant and for the first time today saw him really being a vocal leader with the way he was talking to the younger players like Martial.

1084~~~
Until you mentioned it I hadn't given it any thought, but he's 5 years younger than me and looks at least 5 years older. The main issue is the timber he's carrying though, he should take the international break off and spend it in the gym.

1085~~~
Ive noticed in the last two games, when we have a goal kick, he drops back between the two CBS, who then push out and the full backs go out even wider to allow Carrick to distribute. I think it would work even better if we had Shaw on the left and if Darmian was much better on the right at getting forward. (and Smalling didnt panic with the ball at his feet).

1086~~~
Great performance, reminiscent of the 2013/14 Carrick. Played like a Libero today .

1087~~~
My MOTM. His vision, passing and dictate the tempo was very good today. Second half his defending contribution was very good and vital for our victory. Not his best season but he's still our best centre midfield at the moment.

1088~~~
If we planned on extending his contract, surely we would have started speaking to him. 

We really should tell him where things stand. We owe him that much.

1089~~~
Keeping Carrick <i>and</i> Scwiensteiger would be stupid, taking up squad places with immobile old players who struggle to stay fit, one is bad enough but two is suicide.

1090~~~
Playing them together is stupid, keeping them both isn't.

1091~~~
Yeah, I can't wrap my head around the reasons why keeping two of our most experienced players around even if they are only squad players would be "stupid" especially in a squad as inexperienced as ours.

1092~~~
Yes it is, both are way past their best with no legs and shouldn't be more than last 30 minute "shut up shop" options, you don't need 2 of those in a squad.

1093~~~
Playing immobile old has-beens is stupid, especially having 2 of them in an 18 man squad taking up space where we could bring in quality that can actually play regularly and not need their CM partner to do all their running for them.
One of this type of luxury is ok, but two of them is just pointless, experience isn't everything, it's a word used to justify players hanging around after they are physically shot.

1094~~~
Both are super experienced squad players who organise everyone around them. As long as there is legs alongside them one should play. 

The issue has been when they've played together or with Fellaini.

1095~~~
We have 28 players in our squad.

1096~~~
The issue for anyone playing with them is when we don't have the ball we are down to 10 men, that's no good and neither should be starting at all next season, the midfield needs a top player that can play most games in the role, not 2 immobile old guys jockeying for a role..

Match day is an 18 man squad and only one of them should be in it next season.

1097~~~
As mentioned you have the size of the squad incorrect, and you don't have to play them both together unless the occasion suits or even play them consistently as starters. We also don't have a CM in our entire squad currently who can bring to the table what an on form Carrrick can and as yesterdays showed he is still not finished as a premiership player yet. 

As for Bastian I feel that some have written him off too soon as well as I still think he is getting used to the prem and will be better for his troubles this season as he looks a little off the pace(as have most of our players on random occasions so this may be a coaching and management issue). The fact is having a player of Bastian's experience even if it is only in the dressing room is a God send when it comes to bring through younger players.

That type of experience and professionalism is something you cannot easily replace so it would a silly decision to get rid of him simply because he cannot start up to 60 games a season anymore.

1098~~~
I haven't got the match day squad wrong, it's 18 players, do you really see them both sitting on the bench and accepting it? I highly doubt it, and you don't need two of them there, only one to come in late as a 3rd CM. Carrick had a good game yesterday against a 1 man midfield, most of his games this season he's looked like a statue and unable to keep up with the pace, keeping him is more of the same treading water that got us in the mess we are in, we should replace players with top quality when they start declining heavily which Carrick has, instead of keeping them until the wheels completely fall off.

You want to keep the experience then put Carrick on the coaching staff, he can add it from there and leave Scwheinsteiger to be the guy that comes off the bench in games when we are looking to close out a game. Keeping both means we'd almost certainly have one of them starting games most of the time and that's not good for this teams chances of progressing.

1099~~~
I said last summer that this could be Carrick's last season with us and nowadays I'm convinced we need to move him on. The days were he still looks like a top player are few and far between.

1100~~~
Noticed that he was glued to Yaya all game. Never game him any room, classical case of having him in his pocket.

1101~~~
That's simply not true. It's a different argument entirely from saying the likes of Carrick hasn't got the legs anymore (he hasn't). Positionally, he's still superb and capable of making crucial interceptions and making us difficult to penetrate if we're up against it. Tough to see how you can make that argument after watching him yesterday.

1102~~~
It would be so stupid to let Carrick go. Replace Fellaini instead.

And is Hodgson actually considering not bringing Carrick to the Euros, or is he giving him a break? They desperately need him this summer. After that the NT should plan for the future.
Organisation as well. Just look at City's defense with and without Kompany. It's not just that he's their best defender, he has regressed, but he's the one who keeps the clowns in check.

1103~~~
Yesterday we played against a one man midfield as Yaya is incredibly lazy, most of the time when playing hard working opposition they have a free run past him one on one, which means to accommodate him the other CM basically stays put rather than supporting the attack, which limits our play. It's just not worth it, there are plenty of players out there that can do the job he does without sacrificing mobility in midfield.

1104~~~
Approx 42 mins and 45 seconds he just did a highlight reel over the shoulder dink pass to loop over an oncoming Everton attacker by the half way line. It was glorious.

Don't suppose you have it <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> ?

1105~~~
We're being overrun

1106~~~
Said it many times before, hes done and dusted. Very poor showing.

1107~~~
He's been far too comfortable doing nothing useful in the game. When he actually bothers to get on the ball he's been the only one capable of opening up the play and giving us some kind of attacking impetus but that's been so rare.

1108~~~
Poor game but Everton are doing all the have to render him useless (press him).

1109~~~

1110~~~
Swoon. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Thanks <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

1111~~~
His unwillingness to hit a long pass has been baffling in this game, before the goal it was him and Schniderlin just exchanging passes before the latter took the initiative.

1112~~~
Watched Leicester just before United, Drinkwater looked 10 times the player that Carrick is right now; nevermind Kante. Just embarrassing.

1113~~~
He's not good enough to start anymore in my opinion.

1114~~~
It's like we have 10 men when we lose the ball, he just can't get around the pitch enough and it makes it harder for him to get into space to utilize his passing..

1115~~~
United have had trouble figuring things out in the Post-SAF era and one of those things seems to be moving beyond Carrick as a holding MF.  We'd better get it sorted because his legs are gone.

1116~~~
Wasn't great today, but was really good two weeks ago against City. Just how it goes. I still think he's at best as a holding midfielder in a 433.

1117~~~
If we keep him it needs to be on the used sparingly basis and have to sign a replacement. Michael is great on his day, but those days are few and far between.

1118~~~
We have to drop him. He couldn't cope with Everton pressing him today and away at Tottenham it will be even worse.

1119~~~
I think he was good when on the ball but the problems is always the same with him, we are overran so unless he hits balls like Scholes and dictates play he shouldn't be on the pitch and and less and less team will come to play us and stay back, Carrick's game is nullified when he's under pressure, he would be brilliant player in the 80's or somewhere in Italy...

1120~~~
I'd forgotten he was even on the pitch, not a good performance.

1121~~~
Not worth being critical about and I mean that with respect as I loved him in the back end of Sir Alex's years but it's pretty blatant that he really shouldn't be playing week in/week out for us.

1122~~~
He should be rested as he's had a couple of weeks off. Some of the others have played up to two internationals and some have travelled across the world.

1123~~~
Don't know if the contract situation is affecting his performances. The word is that of the club offers him a contract, it won't be until the seasons end. Think that's an insult. The guy has served us 10 years. Let him know where he stands. I personally think he should go.

1124~~~
Had a poor game, it happens. 

Still an asset and should be given a contract extension in my view.

1125~~~
Lack of legs is a problem. Still has the vision but sometimes sees the game go by him.

1126~~~
That's always been the case though if you ask me. 

Doesn't have the quality to create space for himself a la Scholes and often needs an absolute dogs age to pick a pass.

Would he be kept if Pep was coming in? No chance. Will Mourinho keep him if he's on board next year? Nope.

1127~~~
Well I'm gonna start it. 

Coward of a player, who's on the ball abilities doesn't make up for his lack of off the ball presence, physical agility and mental weakness.

1128~~~
Hilarious how he continues to play.

He does the square root of feck all every game.

1129~~~
Eric Dier looks like him.

1130~~~
He's still got 20 more years in him!

1131~~~
Carrick has always been that type of player IMO...when surrounded with better players in previous years he did an important job of 'keeping the team ticking' but he's never been one to 'take over', especially now the legs have gone.

1132~~~
Didn't get to see the match today but I can already imagine what he was like. 

Carrick can't cope with competitive midfielders - he's just one of those players that is there mainly for nice quick easy passing and support with better players around him (Scholes in Carricks best years). His defensive work isn't up to much either.

It's not harsh, it's just the player he is - useful but never required. Also the idea of him being a 'leader' or captain in any side trying to win trophies is borderline lunacy.

1133~~~
Unfair to use him as the scapegoat for the team. Front to back we were awful, apart from the obvious one or two, not many who deserve to be in a Utd shirt.

1134~~~
Sadly enough, he's still our most proven CM.

1135~~~
Prodded one or two passes through the lines but in truth we were so deep bar Martial there wasn't really anyone to pass to. Can't cope with the high press but that has been the case for years.

1136~~~
A total of 0 bollocks were found between him and Schneiderlin today. Hopeless pairing

1137~~~
Didnt even realise he was playing <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1138~~~
I know and even during those 'good' years I'd argue he still underperformed. Even with all the tools for him to play good, he never really dominated midfield or made his mark. 

He's incredibly overrated and someone, who doesn't work hard enough for me. I'm not expecting Stevie G, Roy of the Rovers stuff but I don't think he has the courage, effort or mentality (not to mention legs also) to actually try and change a game that bypasses him. 

Mata was terrible today but at least he tried to track back, recycle possession and offered an option. That's the absolute minimum you should expect. 

If you look at the first two goals, I'd say Carrick had as big a part as anyone in why we conceded them. 

The first, it was a high ball in the centre of the circle and he makes a pathetic attempt at trying to head it. He's get under it and it goes back towards Smalling/Blind. The second he just ducked under it.

1139~~~
Apparently he cursed the 3 quick fire goals. Hallucinating response.

1140~~~
Been shite all season

1141~~~
If you look when our fullbacks or centrebacks have the ball, Carrick will actively place himself behind an opposition player so he isn't in a position to receive it, he isn't brave enough to take the ball under pressure, when he does collect it off the defense he's so far back he isn't in a position to cause the opposition any concern. For someone who's main asset is supposedly his ability to keep things ticking over he goes completely missing in games we need that asset most. Those who will point to his age as the reason his performances have deteriated need only look at the likes of Scholes and Pirlo. I can understand and appreciate it will effect other aspects of his game but bring able to pass and control a game it does not, not in this modern day of training and technology.

1142~~~
He's been a good servant for over 10 years, he's scored some good goals and put in great performances.  I don't think he's a coward but he is definitely not a leader.  Unfortunately we have lost too many leaders in this respect over the past few years without replacing character players.

1143~~~
Shame his career with us is going to end like this with no extension in sight. He's been great for us and can't really argue against him not getting a new contract. Needs to go.

1144~~~
When literally the only time you notice a player is when he's caught jogging about pointlessly in TV replays of the opposition's goals, that's not good.

Did he actually touch the ball at all in the second half? I mean at least some of our rubbish players are rubbish because you notice them trying to do something and doing it badly. Carrick doesn't even seem aware there's a football game going on half the time. He just wanders about the pitch looking confused, like some kind of really boring zoo animal.

1145~~~
I respect his service for the club but I still think he's a coward (ok ok harsh words but it's accumulated over the years). I will quote you the above posters by what I mean:


The bolded parts are what get me. I can't actually see Carrick being on the pitch, he doesn't involve himself or put himself in disadvantageous situations. And the latter part, I don't mean 'oh he should try to dribble and force the game forward/drive a pass forward (the way Blind does, which I admire and acknowledge the riskiness of)' type of way, I mean why isn't he turning with the ball and playing it forward OR even MOVING with it?

Watch a game next time and see the amount of times, he takes a touch to control the ball and literally waits ON it for a pass even if there's no one around him. I'm not expecting him to be a ball carrier but he has absolute zero ambition to do it. By dawdling on it, he's already set the tempo of the pass, which is standing still.

I loathe his style and his mentality. He's a bygone player imo.

1146~~~
We got a 3 man shield in front of him today and I thought he benefited from it and was able to guide our play from deep with some space to work in.

1147~~~
I actually think Pep would have kept him. He plays Xabi Alonso a lot over arguably better options and loves a passing DM. I think Pep would move Schneiderlin to CM like he did with Mascherano, since Schneiderlin is mobile, tough and a great tackler but lacks the technical ability for a Pep midfield and he'd be far more worried about replacing guys like Fellaini, Jones and whoever the hell is our RW. Carrick would survive another year as a DM option.

But yeah, he's basically done here. I could see him doing well for a lower Prem team that plays 4-3-3 and needs a passer and holder at the base. Newcastle need one badly, whether they stay up or go down. Shelvey is holding right now and that's probably not going to work.

1148~~~
I would keep him because non of our options bar Schweinsteiger have the passing game to play his role effectively and we know all about Schweinsteiger's fitness issues. If we brought in a defensive b2b CM with drive and a No.10 we could have a top class midfield that has a bit of everything.

1149~~~
We have to find a long term solution. Giving him another contract is just kicking the can down the road.

1150~~~
I'd keep Carrick, especially if we play a 433. He shown yesterday that he is still able to control the game, providing he has energy in midfield around him, which he did. West Ham couldn't get near him. Plus, we've got no one, yes, even Schweinstieger, who can play that role. We do need to buy a deep lying playmaker, though, so that next season we can slowly faze him out.

1151~~~
Not long to go mate. Thanks you for everything

1152~~~
This should be his last season at the club.

Hopefully we win the FA Cup and he can complete the set.

1153~~~
Thought he was really good yesterday. Controlled the game, perfectly.

1154~~~
was really good yesterday. must have been his best game this season...

1155~~~
In hindsight, it worked because he had two in front of him who did a lot of running about to allow him the time to control the game. If we had started with 2 holding midfielders, I think they would have just kept us under constant pressure with no outlet. Then, as has been shown this season, especially when the manager is in a cowardly mood, Michael then disappears or get overrun. This midfield three worked last season, he could rest Michael and put Morgan in there, but this was the one midfield that seriously worked last season.

1156~~~
100% agree. Its a shame Van Gaal stopped playing the 433/4141, with a midfield three of Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini, because as you said, we looked a lot better. Actually, apart from Schneiderlin, none of our midfielders really suit a 4231. I'm hoping Van Gaal will now stick with this formation between now and the end of the season.

1157~~~
I think signing both BFS and Morgan muddied the waters a bit. Morgan was enough or maybe him and another youngster. I suppose having the chance to sign BFS was irresistable. It has caused more problems than it has solved.

1158~~~
Thought he had a better game than Rojo and Herrera - so not our worst player. A long way from being one of our better players though.

1159~~~
Ye. Well, I guess Van Gaal signed the two because he knew he wanted to sway towards a 4231, which hasn't really worked for us. If we stayed with the 433, we should have looked to get a similar player to Carrick in the holding role, whilst getting someone like Gundogan (who we were in for) to play slightly above.

Something like:

1160~~~
Is he really getting praised for his game yesterday? He was OK but He was literally given 10 yards of space by West Ham whenever he had the ball, and what did he really do with it? I can remember a couple of decent passes but I'd hope most players would be able to do the same when given near unlimited time on the ball.

1161~~~
When we first signed BFS, I thought he would rotate with Blind and Carrick for the deepest midfield spot and with Fellaini, Herrera and Schneiderlin for one of the two box to box roles. Instead, we've seen Blind go to CB, and both Carrick and BFS play together in one of the slowest spines in the PL. It's been a disaster tactically and in squad management. 

This is what our midfield should have looked like:

DM (Blind / Carrick / BFS)
B2B (Fellaini / Herrera / Schneiderlin / BFS) for the two spots.

1162~~~
We shouldn't be devising ways to keep Carrick for another season IMO, we should be thanking him for his service and parting ways in the summer, it's time we had players that can go twice a week and not require someone else to cover their weaknesses.

1163~~~
So is he off to Everton then? Think he's still got something to offer us next year. But I think it would probably be his last.

1164~~~
He's had a pretty poor season sprinkled with performances where he gives us calm and composure that Herrera, Schneiderlin and Fellaini don't. 

I personally think he's very close to being done, and would replace him this summer. If we can't get a good enough playmaker we'd have to keep him so that he and Schweinsteiger can give us the class in the middle. But we should be looking for an upgrade.

1165~~~
I think it'll be up to him and whether he's happy to be a fill in squad player. 

Carrick deserves a lot of respect for his time here. Taken a lot of abuse by our impatient fans throughout the years.

1166~~~
BBC saying not talks and none planned for now. Safe to say he's off. Wish the club would just say something so we can give him a proper send off. Been an amazing player for us.

1167~~~
I wonder if this points to a new manager coming in, so no decision is being made about MC? After all, van Gaal has said that he'd like Michael to be a coach...

1168~~~
That would be risky as he would only have weeks left on his contract.
Also, if we has already decided on a manager, he would have given word if he wanted him to stay or not. I suspect we have decided not to renew but don't  want to upset the team while there's still much to play for.

1169~~~
Where is he?

1170~~~
Rested for the cup semi.

1171~~~
Disappeared in the second half. He hasn't got the legs any more to go 90 minutes in a game like this and Van Gaal should have brought Schneiderlin on for him.

1172~~~
One of the bad performances again today. Really can't understand the desire to see him sign an extension - we need to move on.

1173~~~
The pace was a bit much for him today but he had one or two good moments in the thick of it.

1174~~~
Those 25 mins in the 2nd half when we got over-run, I kept wondering where our midfield was. Not all Carrick's fault but the lack of athleticism in our midfield absolutely killed us during that spell.

1175~~~
Love him but it's time for us to move on.

1176~~~
I don't think he was as bad as is being made out. The game passed him by in the second half, but honestly there isn't much a DM can do when goalkicks from DDG/corners go to Everton defenders, and then out wide, rinse and repeat.

1177~~~
Boots. Hang. Testimonial. Bye. Thank You

1178~~~
We desperately need to replace him.

1179~~~
He just can't handle when teams press this season.

1180~~~
He's never been able to deal with that.

1181~~~
This season? It's the one reason Carrick is below the top deep-lying playmakers - he doesn't have quick feet to beet the press, which Xavi, Pirlo, Scholes could all do.

1182~~~
True, but it has been worse than ever this season, it is like playing with 10 men. He just completely disappears.

1183~~~
Got totally overrun in the second half, should have been replaced with Morgan or brought on to play alongside him.

1184~~~
he was dogs hit today, needs clearing out with bastian and the rest of the dead wood

1185~~~
Thought he was terrible. That feck up with Mensah for the Lukaku chance summed him up. Defensively and offensively nonexistent, and hesitant on the ball all game. Could have cost us at the end where he lost the ball under pressure. It is time to go, time for fresh legs

1186~~~
Sold Fosu-Mensah down the river for Lukaku's opening chance. Kind of sums up his general ambivalence towards taking matters into his own hands and acting with authority.

The ball was there to be headed away.

1187~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1188~~~
He was fecking class in the first half. Running the show, along with Rooney.

His legs clearly didn't last the full 90 mins. But more importantly, Fellaini and Rooney didn't press effectively in the second half and failed to dominate possession. 

That was a good display from Carrick. Cut the guy some slack ffs. He's nearly 35.

1189~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1190~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1191~~~
Again, I don't get what he's supposed to do when
1. Everton are attacking from the flanks
2. Winning corners or conceding goalkicks
3. The corner is cleared or goalkick launched to their defence
4. Rashford loses the 1st ball, Rooney/Fellaini lose the second ball
5. Everton attack from the flanks
...

He never got a touch, but no one was trying to find him at all.

1192~~~
Bizarre reading these comments. I was at the game today and thought he was great but had 2 poor moments with the Lukaku chance and giving the ball away in the 2nd half. Thought he did well, especially in 1st half

1193~~~
Yes, I replayed parts of the game in my head just now and he had some excellent passes to feet and through a bunch of Everton players. Didn't take the easy option. When he was invisible, it wasn't his fault. I gave him a 7/10 in the ratings and I think that's about right.

1194~~~
I just hope he gets one more season though. He'll be eligible for a testimonial then. One of my favourite players for the last 10 years<i>-ish</i>.

1195~~~
He shouldnt be a starter in the sense of playing 90 minutes every game. He should be more of a luxury player especially at his age.

1196~~~
Carrick is one of my favourite all time United players, I don't know why I just love the guy. The fact he has him playing fecking golf in his Twitter pic says his time is up.

1197~~~
Haha, bantz from Carrick. First half he was really good. Controlled the tempo as usual. Second half, he struggled a bit, as did everyone when Everton were putting pressure on us. Still a class player to have, though.

1198~~~
Everton upped the tempo and he fell to bits in the second half. It is to be expected, the guy is 35 and has never been an all-round power-style player. He's a man who fits a hole and when he's in the hole he plays the pivot well. I think LVG's system requires much more all-round mobility and defensive and attacking action.

1199~~~
He didn't sell anyone. He made a terrible error but Tofu was also there to defend. Both players made a mistakes in that sequence. 

Again, we as a team go to pieces when teams are ready to press and attack us. It has happened on multiple occasions this season. It is not an individual player's fault but a shared blame between our midfield and defense.

1200~~~
I'm not talking about the team though, just Carrick. It is a trait of how he has built his game that he isn't an "all action, roll the sleeves up and lets do it lads" type player. This type of system doesn't really lend itself to individually styled players fitting the system. Not sure why you need to defend him though, it's just an obvious off the cuff remark that is quite visible in his game as it was yesterday. He's 35, can't really complain about it.

1201~~~
Don't think it's about him being 35. Basically what you are describing is a defensive midfielder like Kante, when Carrick is more a deep lying playmaker. His strengths are reading the game, interceptions, his visions and passing. In the system we played last night, 4141/433 whatever you want to call it, the onus 
is on the box-box midfielders on his side to be the all action midfielders and blunt the opposition. Once Everton started pressing us, Rooney disappeared and excelling under that kind of pressure isn't Fellaini's strength either. Now, I am not saying that Carrick shouldn't have done better, but everyone could have done better to stop the barrage of Everton's attacks that came in the second half.

1202~~~
Yeah his legs have been gone for a while, that is all I am trying to say. I dare say timeshare would have been invoked and BFS would have come on if he was fit. Also that I can't blame him, he's 35 and never been a mobility player.

1203~~~
He does very little - but does it with calm composure.

1204~~~
Probably his best game for a while in the league.

1205~~~
I want him to stay over Schweinsteiger. 

Let him play once in a while when our main holding midfielder needs a break. He is still a good player.

1206~~~
MOTM easily. No contest.

1207~~~
He was decent, but he should be a luxury player rather than a starter for us. Thats nothing against him, but to try and see him go 90 minutes three times a week (or even twice) is not what he should be doing.

1208~~~
Too old, too slow. One good game every month isn't what we need.

1209~~~
Still our best CM in my view. Sign him up for another 12 months but use him sparingly.

1210~~~
I thought he was great. Obviously, if you look at what his strengths are and analyse them, you can see he had a good game. Forward Passing - Check. Interceptions - Check. Tackles - Check.

But putting him in a midfield with Rooney and Fellaini was a bit suicidal. If van Gaal insisted on playing Rooney, then Herrera should have started the game. He should definitely be here next season. In games against the bottom 15, I would definitely play him.

1211~~~
Typical Michael Carrick performance recently wasn't it?

Fine in the first half, nice touches, broke up play, did his job and then faded badly in the second and was probably the main reason, or at least one of the main reasons, why Leicester came back into it in the second half and we struggled to get control of the game.

It's hard to blame him though, his legs have gone. We know it and he knows it, but for some reason LVG does not consider substituting him at all.

1212~~~
We could have defended better and we win and lose as a team - but Carrick made a bad mistake that led to their goal. If that was Rafa when he was still here - folks would have called him rash. I don't think he was that great - I think Leicester were there for the taking and sadly it led to their goal. Carrick would i'm sure admit that himself so i'm not going to praise him. They weren't really in the game at that point - just keep your composure ..

1213~~~
If we are to continue with him, it must be like Pirlo at Juve: with two strong runners that can defend the space before they reach Pirlo, so as to reduce his defensive burdens.

1214~~~
MOTM. Especially in the 1st half, he dominated the hyped Kante.

1215~~~
He must be on his way in the summer the alternative would just be further proof of how poorly run the club is at the moment

1216~~~
Played well. Much better than Fellaini and Rooney.

1217~~~
It really is amazing how people are so prepared to let him off the hook. He was crap again. Has been for these past two seasons and more. Look people! How can someone be considered a leader and sometime captain and yet be rated our 22nd best player overall in the EPL? He is finished. Has to go. Good riddance. His influence has been damaging.

1218~~~
I didn't really notice him for good or bad today.

1219~~~
He's a master of disappearing when the pressure is on.

1220~~~
Was decent in some moments and useless in others.

1221~~~
Glad Schneiderlin will be playing against West Ham. I can't trust this guy in a physical game.

1222~~~
Was he injured?

1223~~~
I often feel like I only truly appreciate what Carrick contributes when he's not playing.

1224~~~
I don't understand how he got dropped for this ffs.

1225~~~
LVG said he was feeling tired/weary or something along those lines.

1226~~~
Poor lad. The most divisive player in the history of United and probably English football. 

I can understand why he was not starting, but he needs to come on soon.

1227~~~
Roll on the years one last time.

1228~~~
Tried his best and improved on Schneiderlin.

1229~~~
We play better offensively when hes on the pitch cos he can pass and he can do it by going forward.

The problem is his age and how he should be a luxury player now. But much like with Scholes before him, were relying on him to sort out our midfield at age 35...

1230~~~
Should have started.

1231~~~
Desperately need someone like him. Still our most influential midfielder.

1232~~~
guys, we were always coming stronger in the second half, always. 

Carrick has struggled more than a lot on big occasions and in fast paced games past couple of years so I wasnt surprised he was dropped. We can only guess if he would be up to the big task in the first half against pumped up westham midfield..

saying all this credit to him he was decent. Herrera and schneiderlin on the other hand is a big disappointment this season - zero confidence, they definitely need to step up next season, getting tired of these performances even though we all should known by now that they hardly fit in this drowsy possession-based system

1233~~~
Would definitely keep him for next season. He's still one of, if not our best midfielder which is pretty staggering.

1234~~~
Shockingly true, how have we not improved on an almost 35 year old Carrick after the money we've spent.

1235~~~
Agreed. Had a poor start to the season - looked worst when he was partnered with Schweinsteiger. He's been our best midfielder during the second half of the season - which is hard to believe as we had signed 4 CMs (Fellaini, Herrera, Scheniderlin & BFS) in the past 3 years and 6 if you include Blind and Di Maria (who I believe was originally signed to play there).... oh that money spent and we're depending on a 35 Year old Carrick. 

Getting another season at United is a no brainer - but we shouldn't be relying on him again next season.

1236~~~
Thank you for everything Michael. An underrated player who we will miss. We had the best times with him at the heart of our midfield.

1237~~~
He's not going anywhere don't worry.

1238~~~
He finishes the league campaign with 1973 minutes; 0 goals, 0 assists. 

Fantastic player over the years who has contributed hugely to many trophies. Hopefully he wins one more at the weekend and leaves on a high. It's time.

1239~~~
A nice stroll in the park for his final game at Old Trafford.

1240~~~
Still to this day underrated and the most underrated Man Utd player in my lifetime

Hope this isn't the end

1241~~~
He's just so classy on the ball, always makes the ball do all the work and then finds the perfect pass.

1242~~~
He should probably stay for next season when we are playing at home dominating games.

1243~~~
Still our best midfielder.

1244~~~
Pity he never had the confidence, or perhaps the arrogance, to shoot from distance more often because he can really hit them.

1245~~~
always a downgrade on Keane, always

1246~~~
I still expect him to be here next season. Still a very good midfielder.

1247~~~
Hopefully he stays. Can still be a very valuable squad player, though it definitely felt like a farewell at the end with his kids.
Should go down as a United legend IMO. Came in 2006 and was a mainstay in our midfield throughout those 10 years basically. Key part of so many league titles, trophies, and our best sustained run in the champions league... Will miss him when he's gone and will leave a big gap like Scholes has done since he left. There's just nobody else who can pass it like them 2 in our squad currently and it's why he's still so important for us. 

Also, the only reason this season was relatively poor for him was because LvG changed from the 4-3-3 for most of it until recently (when Carrick suddenly picked up). He needs to play as a deep lying playmaker like that, sitting at the base of the midfield. Not whatever he was told to do before.

1248~~~
Probably is still our best midfielder ffs, well either him or Basti

1249~~~
I guess he is going to be release because he haven't sign a new contract. I hope we can win the FA cup this weekend, so he can say goodbye with a trophy in his hands.

1250~~~
The only guaranteed starter in midfield in the clubs most successful period ever, and yet he's ridiculously under rated. 

Amazing player.

1251~~~
Hope he gets one more year. If not, then I guess it was a good game to end his time at United. Been a superb player for us. Would have been fitting if his strike went in.

1252~~~
Possibly, but he wasn't there to do the same job as Keane.

1253~~~
I hope he stays for another season.. Does a great job when he has the help in midfield, too old to be the only holding midfielder against top teams. Would suck to see him join Arsenal, hope he heads to A-League or the MLS

1254~~~
So let me get this straight, people want to keep him with Schweinsteiger and then Rooney making up the core of our central midfield options with the water carrier and the mop rounding things? Some room needs to be made, especially if Rooney is going to be infecting midfield next season, you can't carry 3 barely mobile has-beens in midfield.

1255~~~
He isn't remotely the same player, and 99% of footballers would be a downgrade on Keane.

1256~~~
I don't think it is down to any of those attributes. Tactically he was never allowed to take such chances. Ferguson mentioned it several times when he scored from a similar position like the one today. He was never given that freedom to begin with.

1257~~~
Im not comparing them as players, I'm talking about the influence on the team...

1258~~~
So let me get this straight, you want to ruin a nice moment where people are commenting and reminiscing on one of our best midfielders in the last decade. The answer to that is yes apparently. I could see all three having a role next season

1259~~~
Ruin a nice moment? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> the posts above me were talking about extending Carrick's contract for a year which is what I replied to. We cannot carry 3 barely mobile has-beens in midfield.

1260~~~
All 3 are still capable of performing very well. I wouldn't put the 3 in the same run on side but you could definitely have the 3 of them in the squad playing a their part

1261~~~
He's one of the deepest lying midfielders in the world. He's had to change that a bit when playing for us because we don't require a deep midfielder.

 With LVG he's been playing a lot more forward, probably been told to run more and intercept play higher up the field. I don't think it's been successful but no disaster either. He's just better further down the pitch.

1262~~~
Would be nice if we could transfer his mind into a younger body. Herrera would be a good candidate, as he doesn't seem to know what to do with his anyway.

1263~~~
What do you mean Possibly? Keane was a much better player.

1264~~~
Possibly.

1265~~~
I never disagreed about Keane being better than Carrick did I? They aren't even remotely similar players though.

1266~~~
This is why were are in the mess we are in, keeping old players who can't do it week in and week out for nothing but name value. We need top talents in midfield not guys playing bit parts, that's patchwork stuff and top sides do not carry 3 has-beens in a team that expects to be in a title hunt.

1267~~~
Rooney may not be mobile enough for striker but he is quite mobile for a central midfielder. If given the choice between Carrick and Scweinsteiger, I'd rather keep Carrick, he's far more effective and useful than Schweinsteiger.

1268~~~
I don't think Rooney is mobile enough for either role and also lacks the strength to protect the ball these days, but I agree on keeping Carrick over Schweinsteiger, although preferably neither should be in our squad at this point.

1269~~~
Its pretty hard to find a play maker of Carrick's pedigree who can control the tempo of a game, make incisive passes while shielding the defense effectively at the same time. There's rarely a player of that mold anymore and you can already see the difference in quality when you replace Carrick with Schneiderlin so I'd keep him for another year and see if we can take more time finding a proper replacement.

1270~~~
The problem is that he's a liability against any team that presses which is most in the PL now, it's like playing with 10 men as he doesn't offer much protection at all now and when teams get about us he's a non factor. I'd give Blind a shot at it before spending another season with a 35 year old who can't run in the side.

1271~~~
Blind is a valid option and a good choice but we have more use for Carrick even as a squad player than freeing up his salary and squad place. There's really not any young players in his position to think he is blocking the path for someone, unlike Rooney.

1272~~~
We never replaced Keane with a like for like replacement. I don't think we should do the same with Carrick either.

It seems like people just want him to stay no matter what. Whether that means him warming the bench for months on end. I'd think that Carrick fans would remember ,and even Sir Alex alluded to, that he requires a run of games to get into form. He wont be getting that with what people are suggesting. 

And we should have been scouting for a replacement for years. 

Morgan is good at breaking up play,but he's  not a playmaker. How about we pair him with someone that dictate play but a bit further forward. A Gundogan like passer. It's up to the club to solve this issues.

1273~~~
I think the old timer that plays a bit part role will be Schweinsteiger next season though, we don't need two of them, especially not when the midfield is also likely to have Rooney in it.

1274~~~
To me this season is his worst season and still our current best midfield. It shows how poor our current midfields are. We need to find Carrick's replacement, someone who is not clueless on the ball, someone who can dictate a tempo. This season should be his last season and we should move on by finding his replacement but do we have anyone available? If we can't find a proper replacement then I don't see why it will hurt us to keep Carrick for another season if we have yet find a proper replacement for him and clearly this season he is still better than our current midfield. And what I meant by proper replacement is someone who is top or world class like Buquest, Veratti and etc. If we are going to sign another Schneiderlin or some unknown players then we might should just keep Carrick to avoid the risk of flop.

1275~~~
You keep saying has-beens as if they aren't capable of performing well. Schweinsteiger when fit is still one of the better midfield a going around imo and only struggled last season as he doesn't know anyone.

We know what Rooney and Carrick are capable on their day and tbh Rooney has had an awesome 2016. You can't get rid of these 3 players at the same time

1276~~~
I keep saying has-beens because they are well past their best IMO, the odd game here and there doesn't alter that. As far as Rooney in 2016 goes, lets just agree to disagree as that discussion wont go anywhere.

1277~~~
With Carrick on the pitch in PL games this season, our goals record is 25 - 18 in 1973 mins, compared to 24 - 17 in the 1447 mins he wasn't on the pitch.

He started when we lost to Midtylland away, Sunderland away, Bournemouth away, Norwich at home, Arsenal away, Stoke away, Spurs away. His experience didn't seem to help us a great deal in those games.

Clearly he hasn't been our worst performer but this has been a season in which there was a huge opening for someone to control the tempo of games (i.e. get us to get the ball forwards a lot faster) and instead the likes of Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Blind have effectively run the clock down, especially when the score has been 0-0.

1278~~~
Philosophy. You can't blame Blind, Bastian, Carrick solely on this. It's LVG way of play. Do you blame the striker to not shoot enough, where they are only allowed minimal touch and most outside the box?

Have you stayed awake all games? The ones who slowed down supposed quick counter attacks were not Carrick or Blind, it's Mata, Rooney, Herrera, Felaini,... whom play in more position but have no pace. Many times, the ball were played quickly up front, but then being slowed down since these guys could't beat the markers. The ball ended up being played back to our defenders.

1279~~~
Carricks experience is over stated and i'm still annoyed him flying out to win the ball, when were were comfortable against Leicester.  We just need to freshen it up.

1280~~~
Having a steamer out there, hopefully he improves in the second half as this is probably his last United game.

1281~~~
The man is too old, legs are gone!

1282~~~
Glad he got to lift a trophy in (probably) his last game. Great player for us.

1283~~~
Was defensively very good aside from that one misplaced pass. 

Has been a great player for us and I'm chuffed he's got the FA cup to add to his tally as well. 

Now for a new contract!

1284~~~
A picture of him holding the trophy anyone?

1285~~~
Thank you for the memories Michael. Its time.

1286~~~
Sign him up, terrible decision to let him go. 

Pleased for him to win the trophy and shame his header didn't go in.

1287~~~
Was good. Should have scored, though.

Great to see him lift the trophy which should be a fitting farewell.

1288~~~
Should remain at the club

1289~~~
Could've scored.  Glad to see him complete his trophy set at the club.

1290~~~
He should stay at the club but not be a starter. I think we should keep him as rotation/back up. He still has a year in him.

1291~~~
Legs are gone. Was painfully evident today as the game wore on. But can still pick a pass. Has he gotten a testimonial from us? Wouldn't hurt to have him as a squad player and an experienced old head for the young 'uns. Can still do a job against teams who park the bus though (which is most of them).

1292~~~
Started off badly but got better as the game went on. I'd still give him a new contract because having experience and another midfielder around is helpful, especially when we are likely going to go through even more changes in the summer. Just as long as we don't expect him to be first choice then it shouldn't be too much of a problem. However if it is his last game then it's nice he could complete his collection.

1293~~~
I think it's time. 

Should be brought back to the club in some capacity after he's retired.

1294~~~
Thank you Michael. The most underrated Man Utd player of this generation. He won it all with us.

Deserves a tesimonial summer send off. 45 mins each half job with his new team (whoever that may be).

1295~~~
Please sign him up

1296~~~
Good player technically but a weak minded man and I hope it's the last we see of him. Good way to end his career though so he should be happy. Retire on a high.

1297~~~
Whoscored gave him the lowest rating of all of our players apart from Smalling. I think that's fair. Bye bye.

1298~~~
I think it's the right time for him to leave, he's struggled this season.

Still been our best central midfielder of course but that's more an indictment of his competition.

Lovely way for him to bow out, lifting the FA Cup and completing his medal collection. He's been a great servant to the club.

1299~~~
Really struggled today but was decent in extra time. I thought it was interesting that Rooney shared his first trophy lift as Captain with him.

1300~~~
Those who say let him go, you don't keep him to continue playing him every week you keep him around for his experience and what he can (and will) still bring to the club

He deserves to end his career here, still underrated 10 years after we signed him

1301~~~
I think it is time to say goodbye. Rooney now in midfield means we should not have too many passengers. 

We need better starting CMs, and for squad player I rather have our youngsters given a chance.

1302~~~
You have to know when to let players go and move on. It is time. 10 fantastic years.

1303~~~
So glad he got to to lift the trophy. Not sure how its decided but props to the club and Rooney for making it happen.

I fecking love the guy. He's been a wonderful servant.

1304~~~
Nobody gives a feck about Whoscored ratings.

1305~~~
Carrick just said Wayne offered to share lifting the trophy.

Classy from Wayne

1306~~~
Would be ridiculous to let him go. Even if we just use him for Europa games in the main.

1307~~~
I'd much rather Carrick stuck around than Schweinsteiger.

1308~~~
Poor first half where he uncharacteristically was sloppy and got turned over in dangerous areas. Grew into it as it went on. Shame he missed that sitter as was a lovely run and a great way to sign off.

1309~~~
Definitely

1310~~~
Last couple of games he's been taking more shots at goal, like he is wanting to sign off in style. Wish he would take a chance more often as he has a good shot on him.
I would still keep him on for another season if he wants to stay

1311~~~
A very underrated player who was the main victim of the "let's not have any competent or fit midfielders" policy. But it's time for him to head off, which is what I assumed Rooney was signalling by the joint trophy lifting.

1312~~~
Unbelievable at his age to be playing so well for 120 minutes especially after playing midweek. He's been brilliant for us and I hope to not see him playing for a different club next season. He should stay with us.

1313~~~
Well, If whoscored said he was crap, it must be true!! Yay! Personally, I prefer to make my own mind up based on what I actually see.

1314~~~
Pointless keeping him unless he plays and Mourinho will not play him. Great way for him to bow out.

1315~~~
Whoscored never rated Carrick high, even when he was one of our most important players in the 12/13 season.

1316~~~
I hope we give him a one year contract, but not have him as a starter. Nothing wrong with having a luxury player with experience to help transition new signings.

1317~~~
I wouldn't want to keep him around another season. The club really does need to move out of the Fergie era as sad as it may be.

However it was a fantastic send off for a fantastic servant to the club, has been instrumental the past 10 years. I remember getting my second united shirt (the anniversary one with the shield crest) with the number 16.

1318~~~
We need some energy in midfield. I wouldn't mind him staying around for a season but he should be nowhere near being a starter.

1319~~~
Loved that burst to the box near the end of the game... 34 years old and still had the energy to do so. Wasn't his best game but no way was he the worst player on the pitch. I really hope that wasn't the final game for us.

1320~~~
I hope he stays - we've not yet been able to find his successor (though Blind maybe would have a chance if the we invest in a dedicated centre-back to free him up), so there's no reason in my view to let him go right now. Even if we recruit his successor this summer, then having Carrick whilst the new guy settles in would be sensible, and would give us a reliable option when injuries inevitably strike. 

He doesn't have to be first choice, but I would trust him in many games next season and I appreciate and value what he has brought to the club these last 10 years.

1321~~~
The guys pretty much won every trophy imaginable for us. Nothing but respect for him. I think he could be useful in a sub role next season, but if not a nice testimonial it is (hopefully the club doesn't mess that up).

1322~~~
Paddy Crerand just said on MUTV that Carrick has extended his contract. Hopefully it's true, I feel he would still be a good squad player for us next season.

1323~~~
It would be painfully disappointing if we'll keep likes of Young or Fellaini and in the same time end Carrick's career.

Better be right this time, Paddy.

1324~~~
It's obvious that Mou wants to turns us into <span style="color: #ff4d4d"><b>dogs of war</b></span>, rather than softies who cry into their lattés if you tell them it's raining.

1325~~~
Yeah, no place for Mike in that England team.. Let's take Wilshere(+10 others) instead..

1326~~~
Shows how idiotic the England setup has been. 
Carrick and Scholes controlled Europe for 4 odd years yet how many games had they together for England?  Playing with Hargreaves and Rooney as well!
