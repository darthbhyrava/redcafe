Might as well get Ander's underway. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I'm expecting big things from him this season, he was very good in the second half of his first season and I think now he's fully attuned to the PL he's going to be an even bigger player for us in the upcoming season, I can see him getting double figures for goals and assists.

Interesting comment just now from LvG, I think this confirms my feeling that Herrera will move into a more advanced midfield role this season.

2~~~
Is it really interesting comment? 

Above four can play as holding midfielders. Herrera is not.

3~~~
Yes, because he isn't. When he had to play there we lost all the things that make him so good going forward.

4~~~
Yeah, think his spot in the team is pretty nailed on for the most part. Schweiny and Schneiderlin are excellent signings, but they don't replace the stuff Herrera can bring to the team. Really looking forward to seeing the 3 of them together.

5~~~
More interesting than that though, it also tells us a bit about the shape we'll be playing doesn't it? Two of those four + another is a forward facing triangle, no?

If we're playing with an out and out #10 then it becomes more likely that we could see someone like Mata or Rooney competing with Herrera for that central spot.

6~~~
No surprise. Both by virtue of his excellence last season and how perfectly he fits the AM role in a Van Gaal 433 (i.e. where that position is filled by a proper midfielder, not a #10), he's in the position of being basically the first name on the team sheet. More than deserves it, too.

7~~~
This was the most interesting thing for me in the press conference, he basically says we are going to play 4-3-3 with the point forward instead of backwards, that's what i hear atleast

8~~~
That would really make sense considering the players we have now.

9~~~
I expect Herrera to continue in that advanced to the right midfield position he had last season where he was playing his best stuff (especially when linking with Mata). Im expecting close to 10 goals from him.

10~~~
It's what he did at Bayern. Had Muller in the #10 behind a line leading striker. Could see us lining out with Ander in the #10, Mata on the right, Depay on the left and Schwein and Morgan behind.

11~~~
Lvg considers him as a No.10. He even said this last season.

12~~~
That bit probably implied that Ander is an unquestioned starter, which seems pretty reasonable given the level and consistency of his performances since the turn of the year. Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Blind will compete for the #6 holding midfielder, and #8 box-to-box positions in the 1-4-3-3. Ander is the presumptive #10 (sort of) midfielder in the trio, or the #10 ahead of two holding midfielders if we choose to employ a 1-4-2-3-1 setup.

13~~~
In Before Fellaini is the starting #10 And Herrera backup. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Anyway, i wonder if he has a more attacking AM like a Di Maria or Mata with 2 solid holding mids behind which he didn't have last season.

14~~~
4-2-3-1 suits our squad better arguably anyway.

15~~~
He's a perfect number 10, really. Offers the defensive support that Mata lacks too, who I presume will play on the right most of the time.

16~~~
I really hope he he will get double digits in Assists and goals next season, he has it in him, certainly when you play as ten and behind you it is morgan fecking schneiderlin and bastien fecking schweinsteiger, so you can really enjoy your more attacking role

17~~~
Think we might change between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 next season, both suit our squad. Herrera is great because of how complete of a midfielder he is, in that he can easily play the #10 role, or be a box to box player in the 4-3-3. It'll depend on injuries and stuff, but 4-3-3 will be the main formation I'd guess and I'm sure Herrera will be one of the first names on the team sheet.

18~~~
Also means that he'll probably be on the bench behind Rooney if we sign a first choice striker....

19~~~
433 is the default formation, and I don't see why we would, as things stand, change between that and anything else.

The defining difference between 433 and 4231 is what sort of AM you play. 433 (Van Gaal's 433, anyway) calls for a proper midfielder in that position. 4231 calls for more of a proper #10, a creative forward. Herrera is obviously one of the first names on the team sheet, and obviously fits the 433 'midfielder' bill better. The only way 4231 fits better is if you expect us to drop him for Mata (more of a proper #10), which seems unlikely.

20~~~
Not really, Rooney will fight for his place with the other striker. And the other striker will fight with Herrera.

21~~~
Yep. Though there is always the chance we sign a top class striker and then Rooney moves back as a #10 again, but I hope not (and doubt it).

22~~~
This is what I'm thinking, I know plenty want Mata or Di Maria to get the AM role but I think Herrera will suit LvG more as he adds the defensive support in midfield that the other 2 don't bring.

23~~~
The Herrera love on here is hilarious. You cant suggest a lineup on here without him and not getting attacked.

He is a good player and had a good season, but for some he is completely undroppable. He has to fight for his place like everyone else.

If we buy a good striker, I can see either Rooney/Mata (#10 position) or Schneiderlin (#8 position) taking his place.

24~~~
He will be played in his best role, the furthest forward of 3 central midfielders which made him stand out as a great player during that short spell he was played there last season. I think he's got a great chance of getting double figures in the league this season. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

25~~~
Glad to see Herrera getting praised. He very quickly became one of my favourite players last season and I'd love to see the team built around him.

26~~~
It will be interesting to see how he fits with our recent signings. Had to adapt himself to LvG's demands last year and by all intents it seems like he came good in LvG eyes. He's a very good player and links up well with the rest of the team, sees the pass and the free man, not the best defensively but good enough and has a lot of energy in the midfield. He's not an unquestionable starter though by any means and we'll see how he fits into the next phase of our plan/system.

27~~~
Exactly. for me its Herrera just in front of Schweiney and Schneiney. He brings passing, energy and importantly, goals! Carrick will still get lots of games.

IF we buy another big game striker then simply Rooney will have to accept that challenge. I dont want to see him dropping into midfield.. ever.

28~~~
van Gaal might always start his captain but nothing would stop him from changing the captain if he doesn't perform. van Bommell situation at Bayern when he fell out with van Gaal. I think it was Gustavo who LVG signed when he thought that van Bommell was declining, removed him from captain and started Gustavo instead of him.

29~~~
he's more than good enough, it's one of his strong assets being fantastic defensively for offensive midfielder, reading of the game and getting stuck in.. he has much better numbers than Carrick for example and with the arrival of Schneiderlin we can be sure we won't lose any midfield battle since. 

He may not start every game since the arrival of new boys and Van Gaal will rotate it at some point and try new combinations but he should definitely need to be first name on the team sheet with Smalling. I reckon he will have cracking season, fingers crossed for him to stay injury-free.

30~~~
I was worried at first but now we bought two very strong midfielders who will be there for the sake of balance so we should not worry that Rooney would play ahead of them.. he has 1/5 good games there depending on which exact position it is. He still could feature as no10 in 4-2-3-1 at some point but never long term..

31~~~
Rooney will have to perform. He was lucky before as his captaincy was not under too greater a pressure, but a certain German could be a real threat, as you say LvG has dumped a captain before.

32~~~
Obviously he's droppable, everyone is. But people are making predictions on the only evidence we've got, which is what happened last season. Based on that, Herrera is clearly the strongest candidate for the point of the midfield triangle. And that's why everyone's putting him there in their line-ups. It's not 'Herrera love', it's common sense.

I'm not sure how you can 'see' Rooney playing there, given that he's our only top quality senior striker. Unless/until we buy someone else, we have to assume he's our regular #9. Or Schneiderlin, given that Van Gaal literally <i>just</i> said that he, Carrick, Schweini and Blind are competing for the deeper midfield positions.

Mata at least makes some sense as a suggestion, and he was good at the end of last season. But Herrera was more important, and Herrera was actually in that position, so it's logical to assume he'll stay there.

33~~~
Sky Sport News HD Germany just said that Herrera could possibly leave United and join a club in spain? Are they (or we?) mad? I never heard about that, not even on Bullsh**-Twitter? Any sources?

34~~~
It was in Marca gossip a few days ago. There didn't seem to be any solid stuff, no prices or sources being quoted, but a suggestion that Atletico and Valencia were interested in his position at United and had not been turned down flat.

I chose to ignore it because I didn't like it. However, if I'm feeling sufficiently paranoid, I could look at LvG leaving him off his defensive mids list and leaving Rooney off his attackers list and wonder if we're going to a forward pointing 3 with Roo at its head. He didn't even get a mention on LvG's "time to adapt" list which could be a positive or (continuing the pessimism) a negative.

35~~~
I think he'll be a revelation next season at the front of a midfield 3 with 2 of Schweinsteiger/Carrick/Schneiderlin/Blind behind him. Will get plenty of goals and assists if given the opportunity.

36~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

37~~~
we won't sell our best player after only his first season in the club. He's my bet for the player of the year award next season (in EPL of course)

38~~~
One would think he would be a definite starter but with LVG I wouldn't be so sure...

39~~~
Confirmation of a 4-2-3-1 for me. 4-3-3 with the point forward.

Four players contending for the two deep spots while Herrera and probably Fellaini contend for the advanced role with Mata and Rooney no doubt getting time there too.

40~~~
I would have liked to have seen us go forward with Herrera playing number 8. I liked what I saw from him there last season and I think he can grow to become something pretty special. As it is with Di Maria leaving, we can assume Mata will be needed out wide and Herrera would make most sense at number 10.

Rooney should never play number 10 ahead of Mata or Herrera. In fact I'd rather change shape, leave Rooney up front and bring in Fellaini.

41~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure he's 100% convinced by Hererra for whatever reason. IMO it's between him and Mata to play behind Rooney and wouldn't be a huge shock if Mata gets the nod. Horses for courses, though. In tough away games Van Gaal might prefer a number 10 who is fond of a tackle.

42~~~
You mean where he was dropped for large portions of the season?

43~~~
Not the last bit he wasn't. He will get plenty of time no matter what. We are United, there isn't a cat in hell chance there won't be injuries. Very likely our midfield will be last season defence. I think LvG can now tailor his side depending on the opposition.

44~~~
I'd assume that would be Rooney, if we get a top striker in.

45~~~
You would? Rooney's hasn't shown any defensively abilities at all last season, and he spent half of it in CM.

46~~~
I think Wayne will have to be on top of his game this season. I know LvG says his captain always plays, way to get round that would be change your captain.

47~~~
We know what happened against West Ham when Wayne tries to stop the opposition attacking.

48~~~
I'd disagree with the former, and the latter has only served to prove that he'll start pretty much every game. If we bring in another top striker I reckon we'll see Rooney at #10 quite a bit.

49~~~
I actually don't get why they want another top striker, I would be getting someone who can play anywhere across the front and is up and coming. Just not inspired by the striker names they keep coming up with. Same old names.

50~~~
I agree he will get his game time and play well for us. I like him a lot but he is not the next coming of Messi that some people are making him out to be.

He's a very good player but he is not the one undropable player in the squad as has been mentioned in this thread after all he was often dropped last year.

As for the last bit of the season. It was worse than the start with only 1 win and 3 goals in 6 games.

51~~~
He wasn't playing number 10 last year and if we go with a midfield 3 then he'll get plenty of game time. 

He was superb at the end of last season and to be fair to him, its not unreasonable to expect a player coming to a new league to take time to settle. The suggestions that he might now be sold because we've signed two midfielder is lazy journalism ignoring the fact that we were so light in midfield last year he was often the only recognised midfielder playing in there. 

For me the first choice midfield is any three from Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Herrera. I see no reason we'd sell him given that we'll potentially have 50 games next year and especially since Carrick and potentially Schweinsteiger (given recent injury issues) are likely not be fit for the whole season without interruption.

Bottom line though for me is clear - why would we move on one of our best players when he's just starting to show what he can do?

52~~~
Can't be arsed getting into positional semantics but I'm talking about him playing as an advanced central midfielder. Which is something he did do last season, on a number of occasions. Where he struggled was when he had to play a bit deeper, which I don't see happening again now we've so many players capable of playing that position better than him.

53~~~
Sorry, whats this? Who said anything about selling?

54~~~
I'm sort of with Pogue and the others in that I think he'll end up in and out of the side this season. I think most weeks we'll play two of Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger/Carrick in midfield with one out of Mata, Herrera and Fellaini playing ahead, in some guise. None of which even mentions the inevitable Rooney positional shift if we buy someone like Cavani.

55~~~
Unrealistic imo

56~~~
Why? He nearly did it last year.

57~~~
Fair enough. I'd be very surprised if Van Gaal wasn't impressed with him at the end of last year so I don't see why he'd neccessarily be the one to drop out. Schneiderlin is nailed on for me to sit in front of the back four and I'm not sure where that leaves Carrick in terms of playing further forward. Herrera is a much better option for me in terms of moving the ball and getting into dangerous positions.

If Mata gets in I think it'll be on the right of a three upfront. I suppose a lot depends on who comes in, but it wasn;'t that long ago Mata was supposed to be away. Seems to me this Herrera to Athletico/Valencia stuff has come from nowhere.

58~~~
As much as I don't think Rooney is a really top striker anymore and would love an upgrade there (if we can find one), I'd much rather we kept Rooney upfront if it meant him having to take Herrera's place in midfield if a new striker is signed. 

Herrera will be a key player for us, and offers a different skillset to the others.

59~~~
Seems to be suggested in the Spanish press - Athletico and Valencia linked. According to the internet anyway.

60~~~
He got 8 in 22 starts this season all competitions, it's not that unrealistic.

61~~~
It really isnt unrealistic. He will play a big amount of the 50 or so games we have in the season. Thats pretty much 1 every 5 games (or 4) provided he plays (which he should).

62~~~
Agreed he will get plenty of game time but I see those 3 all getting games if we are playing well in all competitions. 

I wouldn't go out on a limb as to which of the 3 he picks as his #10 for the first game of the season against Spurs, I think that players have the 4 matches preseason and the training sessions to make their case for a starting place.  

It will be very interesting to see what happens preseason.

63~~~
I think Fellaini will be an impact sub tbh. I think it will be two of Schw/Schn/Carrick and either Mata/Herrera.

64~~~
Sports Witness on the sales claim. Seems claims originated in Italy (and not from Di Marzio!). Wouldn't think there's anything in it.

65~~~
The positive vibe going through the camp has been well noted. I get the impression ander is central to it. great player.

66~~~
Fellaini was one of only 2 players that LVG named as Undroppable last season, the other being his captain. 

He was most important in the games against expansive teams such as Spurs, who we play the first match of the season. I can see him being penciled in for that one.

67~~~
LvG is always saying things. Fellaini was bloody awful towards to end. Seriously awful and I think you will find he can't play against anyone for 3 games after his stupidity in the last game.

68~~~
I forgot that he was banned did they confirm it would be 3 games? 

The whole team was shocking in the last 6 games 1 win and 3 goals is shocking for a team that is supposed to be challenging for honors.

69~~~
That's what happened when Carrick is missing, in a way that is why I don't think he will risk Carrick and Schweinsteiger together. They are options for each other. Although he seems to think Schneiderlin is as well. Our luck they will both get injured and we will be back to square one. Yes it is a 3 match ban. These new players names are killing me. I will likely spell them differently everytime I mention them.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

70~~~
I stick to Bastian and Morgan it's easier.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

71~~~
I think I will and annoy the folk who don't like us using players first names.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

72~~~
Why would anybody care If you call him Bastian or Schweinsteiger? It's his name after all.

73~~~
Some are really funny about it. That you don't know them so don't use their first names.

74~~~
And I'd be, yeah backs away and locks the padded cell on the way out.

75~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I wouldn't care but if they were asking for their autograph they would call them by their name. You wouldn't shout out "Oi Rooney sign this". I would presume you would be phenominally polite and say "Please would you sign this Wayne".

76~~~
Exactly. Where I was brought up you call people by the first names or the last name with their proper title, Mr Schweinsteiger If they are older than you, never just their last name, it just seems so cold.

77~~~
Exactly teachers and bosses call you by your surname.

78~~~
Nah my boss is Dave.

79~~~
I definitely wouldn't call a teacher by their first name. Disagree with that completely. This thread is going off at a tangent.

80~~~
No I would either but then their is that age gap between teacher and pupil. Even if there isn't one 6th former's newly qualified teachers one should be manufactured for propriety's sake. 

Yeah what was this thread about anyway before we took it in a whole new direction.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

81~~~
I can't see any other solution then Herrera being a intergral part of our 3m-midfield. Probably rotating with Felleini and Morgan.

To good to be on the bench more than accationally once in a while. I think he have a good chance to be selected for his NT this season.

82~~~
I'd be much more annoyed if we sold Ander than I will be if we sell Di Maria, he's the ideal player to compliment our 4 more defensive minded CM's, his short passing game is better than Rooney's and he is quicker, more athletic and stronger than Mata.

83~~~
Stop fretting. I actually think the way he knuckled down and learnt how to play a different way will have impressed LvG. There will be games where another player might be more suitable, but he will play plenty. We needed the new signing, but if we start selling others in the midfield we just leave ourselves an injury away from a crisis again. I like you think we could cope without Di Maria better, although I don't actually want him to go. If his wife is still unsettled then he might have no choice but to leave.

84~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/ryrUr7O.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/ryrUr7O.png"/>

85~~~
I hope so, perhaps the media are still stuck in the train of thought they had in the first half of last season when he was out of favour. It would be ignorant of them to think that LvG leaving him out of the 4 CM competition he mentioned at the presser, means he's not got faith in him, I felt it just meant that LvG will now be able to use him as more of a #10. Like everyone else he'll have to compete but I can't see how anyone else would start ahead of him in that position at the beginning of the season. I'm not wanting us to sell Di Maria but there are numerous factors that make it more acceptable than selling Herrera IMO.

86~~~
He was saying they are holding midfielders, so they were fighting for two out of we would presume three places. Ander will be competing for the third one as a attacking midfielder which is what he is best at. Really for the first game it could be him or Mata, depending where he wants to play Mata. Fellaini is suspended anyway. If we start the season well, Fellaini might wish he hadn't got sent off.

87~~~
That was how I took it as well, Bastian, Carrick, Schneiderlin and Blind competing for the 2 deeper CM roles, with Herrera competing with Mata and Fellaini for the attacking CM role. LvG talks a lot about balance, it doesn't get a lot more balanced than that.

88~~~
I agree, it's amazing how our manager can open his mouth and we get a million different interpretations of what he meant.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

89~~~
Well in fairness LvG kind of has his own unique way of using words so that most are left wondering if they actually got his point. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

90~~~
What's this shit about him being sold? If he keeps improving like he did this year, I expect him to be considered one of the best in the world on his position by the end of the season. Especially with the fussballgott playing next to him. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

91~~~
I don't believe it for a minute. LvG came in last season, didn't know the players so had a look at them and then shipped some out. His usual way is to tell players he doesn't want at the end of the season that they will be sold. He has done that this time, RvP, Evans ,Valdes and sold Nani. If Herrera was going he would have already been told at the end of last season. All Ander has spoken about is how much he is looking forward to this season at United.

92~~~
That's how most people took it.  With Bastian. Micheal, Morgan and Daley competing the 2 deep roles while Juan, Ander and Marouane fight for the  #10 position.

93~~~
Valencia is like "These feckers won't leave me alone. Every single day!"

94~~~
We are determined to get him smiling. He will have a fixed grin by the time they finish with him.

95~~~
Ander won't be sold, the rumors makes very little sense and are reminiscent of last season when Van Gaal's words got micro-analysed (he's not 100% proficient in the language still), and Herrera was being linked with moves away from United, prior to him complying with the all-encompassing philosophy. We finally have a midfielder that can add some vibrant link-up play and goals from central areas, and his effervescence will provide a huge spark going forward, despite additions of even Der Fußballgott and Schneiderlin to the likes of Carrick and Blind. All of them are more holding players, and presently can't play the role Herrera can, who brings balance in terms of primarily being a central midfielder who can add goals and link with the forwards in the final third.

Fully expect to see this kind of base setup with minor changes to preserve fitness or account for injuries/ loss of form :

<span style="color: #ffffff">----</span>Schneiderli<span style="color: #000000">n</span><span style="color: #ffffff">--------------------------</span>Herrera<span style="color: #ffffff">---
------------------------</span>Fußballgott<span style="color: #ffffff">-------------------</span>

Schneiderlin and Fußballgott can both play in the #8 box to box role, but the latter has lost a bit of mobility, so I'm not sure he's ideally suited to that role. Some of his best performances for Bayern and Germany have come from a similarly deep position. Morgan can play either the defensive box to box or as the #6, did so for Southampton to good effect.

Carrick in another holding midfielder, and given his age will slowly be phased out with one eye on the future or maybe even start at first until Fußballgott is more accustomed to the league. Blind is the jack of all trades, adept at filling in as and when required, as either the #6, or as an emergency left-back. Not sure how Mata will fit into the midfield three, he's probably been penciled in for the right flank like the 2nd half of last season. A bit too lightweight for a Van Gaal midfield. Could also play when we mix up the formation a bit, necessitating the presence of a traditional #10 behind the striker. So that's all bases covered, not sure Van Gaal would like to disturb the balance now that we finally have a good complement of midfield players.

96~~~
LvG is mental if he doesn't see Herrera as part of his plans. If there's one midfielder we have that I'd like to see us build the midfield around long term, its him. He and schneiderlin (going by what everyone says) should be vital pieces of the team were building. He's no Messi or ronaldo and doesn't warrant a "can't imagine a team without him" treatment but he is a quality central midfielder whose brings a lot of difference aspects to our play.

If you're wondering why this tweet is in here, here's a tip. Click it. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

98~~~
They should find some way to include the 'shot on target' stat too. IIRC Ander had like 100 % through last season, or something close that. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

EDIT : Sorry, 6 goals off 7 shots on target, still pretty imprssive.

99~~~
There's "shot accuracy" on there, and for Ander, it's 29%. Not having that.

100~~~
He didnt play?

101~~~
2nd half I think, I was asleep.

102~~~
Second half in midfield with Schweinsteiger. He did well and was involved with most of our best moves and chances.

103~~~
I will look forward to watching that.

104~~~
Thanks guys! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

De Gea who?

106~~~
He shown he was a really good finisher in and around the box last season, but I wonder if he can do that consistently as a 10, such as Mata, Rooney, Lampard, etc? 

If I had my choice I would have used him how Mourinho uses Fabregas. Against teams where we'll boss possession, put him as an 8, and when we need to solidify ourselves a bit more, put him as a 10.

107~~~
Do you mean "David who?"?

108~~~
I'm glad we're exploring all our options on the keeper situation. Wouldn't mind seeing him go on loan to get some regular football and come back as our no.2 next season.

109~~~
Thought Ander was the best of our 4 CM's tonight, covered a lot of ground, passed it well and was always looking to link up or thread a pass into the channels.

110~~~
Excellent tonight.

Expecting a big season from him.

111~~~
Yep. He's argiably the most consistent player in our team, as his performances are all of a very high standard. The one poor one I ca remember from him was when he broke his rib, which was understandable.

112~~~
Need a gif of that sequence in the 2nd half.

113~~~
That's a good way to break ligaments in your wrist. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

114~~~
He was great tonight, as per with his usual performances. 

Terrific player to watch.

115~~~
I just hope LvG sees his importance to this team.

116~~~
In which midfield combo did he play?

117~~~
Surely LVG sees the kid's quality, especially after the way he took on his instructions and continued to improve. He's clearly been the best CM so far this preseason. Ander should be the first on the team sheet in my opinion.

118~~~
Judging by his comments about the second half, it sounds as though he wasn't as impressed as the people who posted in this thread.

119~~~
In the second half team alongside Schweinsteiger again. I think I posted elsewhere that I hope Schweinsteiger doesn't play in a midfield two for us outside of preseason. It wasn't the most balanced of midfields. I just hope Herrera features in whatever midfield three we continue with going forward. 

It was a steady 7/10 performance from Herrera personally but the team weren't great in the second half.

120~~~
To be fair to him we did nothing much in the second half. I guess Wilson januzaj pereira Lingard combo is too raw. Coupled with the fact that McNair can't cross and Blackett doesn't attempt to. Herrera and schweinsteiger Were good.

121~~~
He singled out Pereira for phrase though. Said he was the "only good thing" about our second half performance.

122~~~
I thought he would actually shuffle the teams about as we don't know if Bastian can play with Carrick or Morgan can link with Herrera. Bastian and Herrera are having to try and link up with players who might not even play next season. Wilson looks hopeless, Adnan is not progressing. Perreira looks the business though. The defence was all over the place which then doesn't make Smalling look good. I know which team their talents would look better in. Will be interesting to see how the team cope with Barcelona. I fear for some of them.

123~~~
I think the defence only looked bad because everything in front of them was disjointed. Schweini (I'm getting tired of typing it out in full) and Herrera didn't complement each other too well today and because we had less control of the game they were exposed a bit more. I can only remember attacking contributions from McNair. I thought Evans played well. I agree with you about trying different midfield combinations though. Hopefully he will mix it up in the next two games because he hasn't got any more games to try things out before the season starts. Is this the fewest games we've ever played in preseason? As for Adnan I think he is suppressing his natural instincts a tad which is taking away the excitement.

124~~~
The fact he isn't mixing it up is a worry for me. I think Bastian is cover for Carrick and Ander would link better with Morgan. LvG thinks it is better we only play 4 games in pre-season, the amount of experimenting he needs to do with this squad to get us up and running straight away is immense. These 4 games might not be enough. Di Maria, Rojo are coming back, is he going to chuck them straight in or is it going to take ages for them to play and get as he says match rhythm?

125~~~
Best combo would maybe be Schweini or Carrick, Morgan and Herrera. 

He tried Carrick and Morgan and then Scweini and Herrera which is not too bad cause Herrera is a CM. IDeally he would play as a nr. 10. But he still has 2 more games to see which combo is the best in midfield. Cant remember which midfield combinations we had vs America.

126~~~
This quote from the post-match presser sums up why I think Van Gaal has his doubts about Hererra:

"It was a threat always and that was not necessary. Our positions in midfield was not so good as in the first half."

127~~~
I personally don't feel Ander is at his best in a midfield two. I don't think its surprising that most of his best football came for United on the right hand side of a midfield three. That, to me, is where he excels. He's not a number 10, he's not a number 6, he is a box to box midfielder. Herrera can play as part of a double pivot but you lose a lot of his attacking impetus using him in that way. I'm not certain if Herrera is as good in a midfield two as Carrick, Schweinsteiger or Schneiderlin. Van Gaal's apparent departure from 4-3-3 in favour of 4-2-3-1 will likely result on Herrera returning to the subs bench this season.

128~~~
I'm just going by what I've seen other posting, but apparently he directly came out and said Schweinsteiger played bad today, but didn't say anything negative personally about Herrera?

129~~~
Well in 4-2-3-1 you usually have a player who has a bit more defensive work and a CM who tends to go a bit forward and in this case Herrera would be that CM. He doesnt need to play as a part of double pivot. in 4-3-3 he basically played a CM too.

130~~~
That's correct. He didn't name Hererra. Although he only named Schweinstieger in response to a question about his individual performance.

131~~~
Herrera needs to do much more defensive work in a 4-2-3-1 than he does in a 4-3-3. In a 4-3-3 if the right handed centre midfielder advances to form a triangle with the right back and right winger, the left handed centre midfielder can come across to support the anchoring midfielder to prevent our midfield being overrun. It allows both the left and right handed midfielder more freedom to get forward, depending on where the play is. In a 4-2-3-1, the '2' centre midfielders act as the cover for the #10. Whereas in 4-3-3 the two box to box midfielders share attacking duties and also help out in defence, in a 4-2-3-1 the #10 has virtually no defensive duties and that means the two behind him have to be far more disciplined. Herrera can play that role but its not his best role, and its very questionable if he's as good at it as Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.

132~~~
4-2-3-1 can easily be transformed in 4-3-3. As in 4-3-3 in 4-2-3-1 you have wingers too whom can Herrera help in attack and form triangles while one player, nr. 6, stays a bit behind to cover or to be free for the ball.
As you said it yourself in 4-3-3 he'd have some defensive duties too.

133~~~
I disagree that a #10 in a 4-2-3-1 would have no defensive duties. Especially if Van Gaal employed 4-2-3-1, who instructs the team to be as compact as possible when not in possession. Players roles play a much bigger part than formations. If Van Gaal lined the same 11 players up with either 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, I would predict the instructions of each player would be the same in each formation. Especially as he seems to favour a defensive midfielder, box to box, and an attacking midfield in his 3 man midfield anyway, so his 4-3-3 is very much a 4-2-3-1 anyway, and more of a 4-5-1 when not in possession.

134~~~
Depay has done virtually no defending as a #10, he's like a shadow striker. Likewise Perriera and Januzaj in that position.

135~~~
All I heard was: "The only highlight was the goal from Pereira". I.e. nothing about any of the general performances being good.

136~~~
I always said there is something about him that van Gaal doesnt like. I still maintain the fact he will be in and out of the team throughout the season. He is a caf favourite, but i think that he isnt perfectly suited to the way van Gaal wants his midfielders to play.

137~~~
I may be wrong but I predict that will change when we are up against tougher opposition than Club America and San Jose Earthquakes. 

The formation in the last two games looked more like 4-4-2 to me, with how close Memphis and Rooney were playing together. It would get torn apart by the better PL sides. I'd be surprised if Van Gaal persists with it into the season.

138~~~
Not that again, LVG said he wanted Herrera to adjust his game, he did it and was a regular started in the 2nd half of the season.

139~~~
This. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

140~~~
He name-checked Pereira twice. The first was the quote you mention there but he also referred to him when he was asked about Schweinsteiger's performance:
"

141~~~
If someone ask specifically about a certain player then he has to give an answer. Perreira has been good in both games and has scored. He will praise him. Somebody should ask why the man who is supposedly going to be our main striker hasn't scored. Hopefully he will be doing that once the season starts.

142~~~
what is LVG trying to get at, it f###### makes no sense. Bastian is not a DM, Herrera is not an DM they are both CM who can get forward with the ball. Carrick and Morgan are DM. pair 1 of each and you have the balance hes looking for. Herrera is not to blame, LVG is. understand the abilities of your player and put them in positions that compliment them and  that will get the best out of their abilities. i can not believe LVG is having a go at Herrera again, the best midfielder we have had in years and hes shitting on him, he must be more of a muppet than caftards just because hes got shiny new toys. Carrick and Herrera partnership has been far better than the shower of shite midfield that has been served up so far in preseason. sort yourself out and the positioning of the players, Depay, Blind etc

edit: a bit ott oh well, were getting mauled against barca

143~~~
Pre-season means absolute feck all, both individual player and team performance wise. You only have to look at our performances last summer to see that they translated into nothing, when the season started.

144~~~
I agree, I have mentioned that before. In that case he shouldn't be so damn critical. It's about getting players fit. I wish he would switch the teams round a bit. I am not sure he will learn much from these lineup, keep to the formation that started working last season. It will be interesting what he does in the last two games.

145~~~
I think he wants to set out two balanced teams with enough quality in each halves. If we decided to play 4-3-3, with Herrera playing the first half, then the second half team would be significantly weakened, and it wouldn't be fair on the entire half eleven. Playing the 4-4-2 allows him to evenly spread the quality a 4-3-3 doesn't. 

Being critical is important, otherwise the players might assume they're playing well, given we've won two out of two.

146~~~
A bit?

147~~~
Van Gaal obviously has his doubts about Herrera, otherwise he wouldn't have gone through a period of time when he was barely used last season and we prefered Rooney in midfield to him. However he gave him a fair chance towards the end of season and I'd like to think that he can see that Herrera took it and impressed. I don't think he hates him to the extent where he wouldn't be keen on giving him a proper chance next season. With the selection we have in midfield he will obviously have to fight for his place, everyone will, but he is well capable of making himself a permanent fixture in the side.

148~~~
Problem is he hasn't been setting two teams where the quality is balanced. The first half team is loaded. Then Smalling, Bastian and Herrera have had to carry the 2nd half team. The first game they did. Yesterday Perreira showed what a talent he is, but the rest of the kids a mile off being in the first team. He should have mixed it up a bit more. He has to pick near full teams for the next two games. This is why I am worried about only 4 pre-season games.

149~~~
How on earth are people using pre-season fitness workouts to conclude Van Gaal still doesn't like Herrera?

150~~~
Hopefully. Although the closing fixtures, without Carrick in the team, left a bit of a bad taste. I haven't watched the pre-season games but here's hoping Hererra has done enough to wipe those games from Van Gaal's mind.

151~~~
Of course they need criticising. Maybe he was getting at some of the kids not grabbing their opportunities. Who knows what the logic with LvG is. Not sure he know himself sometimes.

152~~~
God only knows. All that matters is that they get fit. I just wish he had changed the teams round a bit. Picking them like this is might just put in some of the kids heads that they don't matter and they are definitely just the second string.

153~~~
Mainly because he was so harsh about our second half performance. 

Although it's also fairly obvious we've been playing an A (first half) and B (second half) team in both the games so far, with Hererra playing for the second string. So there's that.

154~~~
You think his 3rd captain is someone he considers part of the B team?

155~~~
Yes. So long as he sticks with this silliness of playing a left-footed CB in every game anyway.

There's no doubt that the first half team is his perceived best XI, surely? Isn't that obvious? Fairly sure he's said as much too.

156~~~
Seeing as Blind played ahead of Smalling and Schweinsteiger was on the "second string", I'm not entirely sure.

157~~~
Only on paper. It isn't as great as you'd think when you factor in different aspects such as age, experience, position etc. It has three new signings, all of whom are still quite relatively young. Blind is playing in a position he's never played for us. Carrick is coming off a long lay off, and Rooney seems to be severely out of form. 

I think you worrying a bit too much. Pre-season, like you've said, is an opportunity for our players to gain match fitness, and not a lot more. The quality of the opposition is so poor that you'll never truly be able to determine much from player/team performances. If we're expecting to learn much more from these games, then we're clueless. Other than gaining match fitness, pre-season allows the youngsters to mix in with first teamers, and allows new signings to learn a bit about their new team.

158~~~
Last season was enough proof that he prefers a left footer on the left and not that he always will play one there. 

How's there no doubt? I think it's about balance. He doesn't want to play 2 new CMs at once and wants to combine a less mobile CM with a very mobile one. Hence the Carrick schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger Herrera pairing. 

If he's said the 1st half team is his main 11, I've missed it. You have a link?

159~~~
Bitterly disappointed for Chris Smalling in that case.

160~~~
I don't think he sees Schweinsteiger starting games for a little while yet. I suspect he'll use him cautiously enough until he's a bit more acclimatised to the league.

161~~~
Smalling is ahead of Jones even if he isn't ahead of Blind as a left sided CB, that much is clear IMO.

162~~~
I agree, that the majority of the first half team will be apart of the first XI, but I don't think you can draw definitive conclusions on all of them.

Smalling is van Gaal's third choice captain now and was a mainstay at the back last season. He's even acknowledged how much he's grown as a player and leader. Likewise, I don't see Schweinsteiger as part of the second string team either. The likelihood is, he still wants a bit of experience and leadership in the second team, as it's bereft of it without those two.

Not disputing that LVG doesn't seem too keen on Herrera however.

163~~~
There's no team A and team B.....

Season hasnt even started and again that LVG doesnt rate Herrera stuff, based on absolutely nothing.

164~~~
Not his fault he isn't right-footed so yeah, he can feel a little hard done by. From what I've read, though, he didn't play very well anyway.

165~~~
I think he was okay but I thought he could be more on the ball, perhaps he thought that BFS could orchestrate the game more and didn't impose for that reason.. we should not play midfield two though.

It's clear that two best midfielders are Herrera and Schneiderlin now only to pick Carrick/Sweini to play at the base, those two should never play together as I highly doubt they are mobile enough

166~~~
Don't worry, Mike Smalling will be in the first team, very soon.

167~~~
I would be as well. I think Chris is our best CB. Also if he keeps the first half team against Barcelona it will be quite scary to see how Blind copes. He should have given a penalty away against Club America.

168~~~
Not at all. Last season we played Smalling and Jones at centre back, and in a big game against Liverpool when Rojo was available too. I think it's a preference more than a necessity. 

I'd also say that the first half team is more balanced, but the second half XI has experience in Smalling, Evans, Herrera and Schweinsteiger. Smalling has the armband on merit, it could easily have gone to Schweinsteiger or Evans, but I think Van Gaal sees Smalling as a first team player.I would say that the only players guaranteed to start the season currently, fitness permitting, are Rooney, Mata, Carrick, Smalling and Valencia. I think the reat will depend mainly on what he sees in preseason matches and training.

169~~~
Of course. People need to talk about something. Blind won't be our starting cb ffs.

170~~~
Also it's LVG's preference to have a left footed CB but he didnt insist on that last year nor was stubborn about it..

171~~~
I really hope that's true but I was shocked to hear him be so dogmatic about it in the pressers on tour.

It's definitely possible that he's playing Smalling in the second string to shore things up but I refuse to believe it's a coincidence that he's been playing so many obvious first XI players in the first half of both games and so many fringe players in the second half. Seems clear to me that we're starting each game with very close to what Van Gaal currently perceives as his best XI.

172~~~
To me you play your best two CB's. Left footers aren't easy to find anyway, so I wouldn't want quality sacrificing to satisfy a theory.

173~~~
Carrick controlled the game much better in the first half that Schweinsteiger was able to in the second, but much of that could be down to the other players on the pitch. I'm sure Carrick will start the season, but the question remains, in what system? 

A midfield three is more suitable, and I'd expect Schneiderlin and Herrera to start as Schweinsteiger acclimatises, but I think we might want to progress to a midfield two with a #10 in front of them. Herrera can move to that role and Schneiderlin has the legs to cover Carrick, so that makes sense too in terms of fluidity and versatility for the start of the season.

174~~~
The next two games might throw that completely into the air. The lo and behold the season is on us.

175~~~
Best CB pair should be Smalling plus one, Jones, Rojo or a new CB which would be the best option.

176~~~
Herrara is a quality player. Van Gaal just needs to play him in the right way. He is not a dm.

177~~~
If this is true then I will honestly have very little hope of challenging this season. Imagine Schweinsteiger not getting a game? Christ.

Herrara is still our best attacking midfielder. He would be great in a 3 with Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.

178~~~
.... yet he's not using Herrera in the second string to sure things up.

Keep your narrative going at all costs mate.

179~~~
Come on people, we've played two pre-season friendlies against poor teams. You can't say who is first choice and who is bench material already. At this stage last year one of our best players in the friendlies was Reece James, who's now at Wigan.
We'll know much more after the PSG and Barca games.

180~~~
It's "shore things up" and that's what defenders do, not attacking midfielders.

181~~~
It wasn't only Carrick who controlled the tempo Schneiderlin did as good as him or even better in first 15 minutes which makes me feel that we might not really need to use DLP, Sweinsteiger did much better than Carrick in the first game on the other hand.. so it will be interesting to see which one of them starts against Barca.

Anyway Carrick is here longer and is also a safety option so he might be little more ahead of BFS in the pecking order, as we've always seen with Van Gaal that he plays his players until certain player have a bad game or "option no2" has a significantly better performance to bench the former.

Good selection headaches for Luis

182~~~
Get used to it. By all accounts (including the manager's) he's still a long way short of being properly match fit. And that's without even allowing for easing him into a new team/league.

183~~~
we won't

184~~~
Actually it might just get more complicated.

185~~~
It doesn't take too long for a pro footballer (without any injuries) to get fit though. Hopefully he will be sooner rather than later.

186~~~
Absolutely.

187~~~
Ah, fair enough.

188~~~
I'm not convinced it is the case. Seemed more like Smalling ** last season and I doubt much has changed.
Agree.

189~~~
Not at his best yet since it's obviously pre-season, but it's clear IMO that we need to play him regularly in a midfield 3. Provides the forward energy and drive in the middle of the park, as well as lots of intelligent movement

190~~~
The first and second half teams are hardly a barometer of what he prefers. One would assume some of the senior players are kept for the second half for crowd entertainment.

191~~~
I think a player like Herrera will always take a dip in form when there's no defensive midfielder present around him. That's why with Schneiderlin and to an extent Schweinsteiger (who isn't strictly defensive but adds calmness to the area) I'd expect that he'll no longer have this problem. I'm also assuming that's why we've brought Schneiderlin.

192~~~
I think it's close to a first 11 but not exactly it.. Like the center back and midfield partnerships I'm not sure are his first choice. For the first halves, he has our 2 most defensive mids, but our 2 most attacking center backs (well, if you count blind as one). The second half is our 2 more attacking, creative midfielders who are weaker defensively, but behind them is our 2 most experienced center backs in Smalling and Evans. So in that group of 4 central players, there's a similar balance to it for both halves. The rest are very clearly A team and B team, but those 4 could change once we start the season (and I'm not sure if we'll play a 4-2-3-1 when it starts or if he's just trying it out right now).

Maybe I just have blinkers for herrera but I can't see him not playing a big role this season in the midfield 3, as he offers so much to the team and he plays at a high level consistently, and even this pre season in both games he's impressed me more then the other 3 center mids.

193~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/e6tEKuPbDe2/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

194~~~
i thought he did a nice job being tidy in midfield yesterday. he has fantastic control of the ball in tight places and helps relieve pressure in a hurry by not only being confident on the ball but distributing it smartly. just a brilliant player.

195~~~
I think he's played well in the two games, but he seems to be quite reserved in his play. It sort've looked to me like he was trying to give some of the younger players a chance to shine last night (he would pass to them in situations that he would likely take the ball forward himself normally). Or maybe that's just how LVG wants his center mids to play right now.

196~~~
I just think in a midfield two he has to be less adventurous. He plays better in a three where he has less positional responsibility.

197~~~

198~~~
Wish he was a better passer.

199~~~
He needs to be playing, he need his versatility and movement in midfield to compliment the holding/combative qualities of Schweinsteiger and Carrick.

Schneiderlin looks good in there too.

Maybe a Schwein, Schneid, Herrera combo?

200~~~
This is what I expected when we signed the Sch's

201~~~
So. Looks like I was right after all?

202~~~
If he does start with the exact 11 he did so far, Yes. Blind at CB over Smalling would be so fecking ridiculous though.

203~~~
surely the future of the midfield is 

schweinsteger/carrick schneiderlin
                    herrera

204~~~
It might be, but he has to see what Morgan can do and how he copes in our side. Also Bastian had not done any training, so needed minutes, unfortunately that might have led to the slight injury.

205~~~
There is nothing this boy cannot do from central midfield. Nothing. Right foot, left foot, header, tackle, pass - to space, to feet, high, low, short or long, shoot, hold, high energy. Everything in his locker. Easy to forget just how many goals he was a part of too, not just the assist or finish. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

EDIT - watching that has reaffirmed my view that he is the most complete, all round central midfielder in the league. No doubt about it.

206~~~
It think it's quite likely that "the most complete midfielder in the league" won't be in our first 11 when the season starts. He's probably gonna have to fight his way into the team (again).

207~~~
There will be plenty of games to go round. Plenty of injuries likely as well. Ander doesn't seem like a sulker, so at least we know if he does come on in games he will try his best. That is all you can ask for. LvG has a load of shiny new toys to play with, so it was likely they would get game time to prove themselves. It's Smalling I am feeling the most sorry for atm.

208~~~
Aye, I had a suspicion that Herrera would be in and out of the team this season anyway so him starting off on the bench isn't a particularly big shock. Not picking Smalling surprises me though, I'd have thought he was nailed on.

209~~~
Smalling and Herrera should both be nailed on starters this season imo.

210~~~
tbh lets wait and see.

211~~~
It could all change remarkably quickly. Bastian is good, but was warned by Bayern about the pace of the PL. Luckily Morgan has played in the PL so he should settle, but there is a lot of pressure playing for United compared to Southampton. I would prefer a midfield of Carrick/Morgan/Herrera, the latter two providing lots of enery, with Bastian to be rotated in when necessary.

212~~~
Herrera will get back in very quickly, LVG will notice the lack of creativity and pace without him in the side soon enough.

213~~~
But how many points will it cost us before he realises this? LVG will lose a lot of my faith if he replicates last seasons mistakes.

214~~~
Cant tell, it's not like Herrera will single handedly win us the games so maybe LVG will be putting it down to other things again. Like the new players having to get to understand his new philosophy again.

215~~~
The one thing that worries me is if the pace of the game is slow again, it was at times even with Ander in the side. That to me was down to the boss. Having Depay in the team might change that, but it is no good for him if the build up from midfield is laboriously slow.

216~~~
With Schneiderlin and Herrera I think we could seriously speeden up our game. If he goes for a Carrick, Bastian, Schneiderlin midfield for instance, maybe the tempo wouldnt be too bad, but the creativity and depth in our game would suffer.

217~~~
You say that but I think Herrera was one of the most important players in the team last season and should be undroppable. I think I saw a stat that said in every game Herrera and carrick started together we won, which really should cement his importance. I think people are forgetting just how good he was last year at times.

218~~~
It's a bit weird if two of our best players last season get dropped from the starting eleven to start the season. But I've given up trying to second guess LVG's selections.

219~~~
Smalling will likely get in when Phil attempts some kamikaze tackle and brains himself on the goalposts.

220~~~
I'm hoping for a 433 with our squad as it is as our midfield selection is exceptionally strong on paper and imo, gives us our strongest line up.

221~~~
Wait where did this „Herrera will be benched again” story originated from?

222~~~
I'm looking for major improvements in Jones I was such a fan when he first came. But in time he looks like that youthful power and over eagerness to do well was masking a few things and the last couple of seasons he has looked incredibly brainless and incapable of sensing danger. I hope he pulls it all together and for the sake of him realising his full potential he doesn't become a bit part player at United because that what he looks destined to become at best and I had much higher hopes. (That's why I'm probably incredibly hard on him in my past posts).

223~~~
Herrera wasn't in the group of players who trained together, the group which LvG seemed to imply could possibly start against Spurs.

224~~~
But he's the better player, he shouldn't be getting into the side through injuries, he should already be in it. Likewise for Herrera.

225~~~
Does anyone have any idea who might start for Barcelona to see if Blind will be torn a new one?

226~~~
You'd hope so, but then Herrera did play just 75 minutes of football between mid-December and February last season. In my view we should be going with a midfield three of Herrera & Schneiderlin and then one of either Carrick/Schweinsteiger to dictate the tempo of the game; a midfield containing both of the latter two players would surely be short of energy/mobility.

227~~~
Out of all the managers in the Premier League Lvg is the only one i would expect to drop Herrera after the fantastic season he had. He just has these weird decisions time and time again.

228~~~
Suarez will play and that's enough

229~~~
Hopefully if Phil pulls some of his faces it might scare Suarez away from Blind.

230~~~
I doubt he will care too much as long as we keep the ball as per philosophy. He will blame the lack of creativity down to not having a Robben to carry the attack on behalf of his team.

His teams seem to be built to just keep the ball and with only one player allowed to take risks/carry the attack - at least recently watching us for the first half of last season, Netherlands at the World Cup and his Bayern team.

231~~~
LvG's preseason experiments are Blind at CB and Depay as a 10, I don't think he's made his mind up yet about the team for next season at all, and he's spread some of the experienced players about between his two teams, I would say the PSG team would say far more about his thinking then Barca.

232~~~
I would say that he thinks the balance and structure of the team is more important then the individual. If you don't follow the instructions he wants from you in the position selected then you are left out. For example last season Young deposed Di Maria as he integrated far better into LVGs system, despite being an obviously inferior player.

233~~~
Not how he set up at Ajax or Barca.

He's more flexible than he gets credit for.

234~~~
And he's back to being on the bench <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

235~~~
Then will have to carry a pile of kids in the 2nd half.

236~~~
RIP Herrera. You were pretty good.

237~~~
van Gaal clearly doesn't rate him and that infuriates me.

238~~~
He doesn't rate Smalling then either. I presume he wants to see what Morgan can do. I know Fellaini is banned but he is available for the CL qualifying. Is he that pissed with him about the sending off?

239~~~
I guess re Fellaini as well he no longer has his position from last season as the formation has changed (same with Ander as well). I'm guessing both competing for the 10 position that Memphis is occupying in preseason.

240~~~
I love him but I do understand if we're playing a 4-2-3-1. He can play as a 10 or as a deeper midfielder, but he's more a box to box. Schneiderlin and Carrick are more defensive midfielders, Mata/Memphis are more suited to behind the striker positions. When we play a real 4-3-3 like last season he walks in IMO. Or should. As a proper mid I probably rate him higher then Schweiny, Carrick and Schneiderlin currently, maybe not Schweinsteiger as we are yet to see how good he is currently but he's class obviously.

241~~~
It's only a friendly guys. Maybe wait until we start playing some proper games until we all start losing our shit?

242~~~
It seemed inevitable but it makes no sense, a #10 on the RW and a LW at #10 and Herrera on the bench.

243~~~
Doesn't remotely surprise me. Just can't get rid of the feeling that Van Gaal hasn't taken to him.

244~~~
he could easily play next to Schneiderlin and be more useful than Carrick, we will need that movement whích Morgan can provide but he's not technically that good as Ander, don't understand if we play this flat 4-4-2(1-1) next season, it won't work, not panicking yet but some serious doubts like with the 3-5-2 formaition which cost us at least 9 points at the end of the season..

245~~~
Its fecking stupid, thats what it is, just like half of LVG's stupid and pointless tactics from last season.

246~~~
It does make sense really. Mata has done well on the right, but through the middle Memphis has huge potential IMO and adds loads to our goal threat. He's shown excellent creativity and movement to get in on the end of chances and looks like he'll score or create every game. That's exactly what you want from your 10. Mata on the right doesn't have the pace but he's a very intelligent player and hasn't done badly at all IMO. We lacked pace through the middle and relied too much on crossing and wing play last season, so with Memphis through the middle we have that threat down the middle as well.

247~~~
I think he's off. LVG just doesnt like him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
I'm sure he'll be on the bench for next 8 months. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

LVG and his stupid decisions, we wont go far with him at the helm!

248~~~
He'll get plenty of football next season, keep your shit together everyone.

249~~~
No he wont. LVG just doesnt like him.

250~~~
It's not a flat 4-4-2 in any way though. It's a 4-2-3-1 with 2 defensive/holding mids. Just Schneiderlin has more license to roam forward probably while Carrick sits and dictates. The wingers are further up and not wide midfielders either.

251~~~
He'll be in and out of the team.

Guess he doesn't fit this shape in LVG's eyes, which I can sort of understand. He probably wants more of an attacker rather than a midfielder at #10. Plus it never seemed like Van Gaal rated him quite as highly as a lot of the caf does.

252~~~
We could have Ander posing much of the same threat as Memphis in the #10 role and have Memphis providing a genuine goal threat from his natural role on the left, as opposed to having Young there who offers very little goal threat. I just mentioned Mata as he is another example of a player out of position in the formation. He has had some decent games there but he doesn't keep the shape well and is far from an ideal wide player IMO.

253~~~
If you saw the interview they have just shown on MUTV, Ander is going nowhere.

254~~~
I love Ander as much as his biggest fan probably, but it's a completely different threat as a 10. Memphis is a much more direct threat on the ball, has that threat from range, can go past players and adds genuine pace. Herrera's best qualities are his quick and incisive passing and interplay, and he's a really smart player, but it's a completely different threat to Memphis. Young has the position on the left locked down currently I think, and he's such a reliable player in terms of effort defensively and has improved a lot going forwards. Memphis will probably be the left winger eventually, but to start off, I think he'll play in the hole while Mata and Young are doing well on the wing.

255~~~
I'm kiddind but some people are not kidding which is.. crazy.

256~~~
He may not be a van Gaal favourite, but it's a bit of a surprise to see him omitted from the team given the opposition we are facing. You'd think we'd want to match up in midfield, especially with a player so comfortable on the ball.

257~~~
If they get over run in midfield. LvG will do his nut.

258~~~
Strange he's opting for the 4-4-2/4-4-1-1 then if that's the case.

259~~~
He will do his nut even though he might be the cause. It depend how Barca play and how quickly. I was worried about the Real game last year and we won it. I am probably more worried about us going unbeaten and then having the same start to the season.

260~~~
I think the key in the #10 role is the ability to feed the front 3, to me Ander's vision and short passing are better suited to that role than Memphis who has barely ever played there, where as Ander played there plenty for Bilbao. As for Young having the LW spot locked down, that is troubling IMO as while he was solid last season we need an upgrade in quality in the role which is what I thought we bought Memphis for.

261~~~
I worry that Memphis, because he wants to prove himself won't feed the front man but will want to be taking shots all the time. That is the risk with a young player.

262~~~
We need to get this kid in the team. Switch to 433 - Carrick, Schneiderlin and Hererra. Yes Bastian is a big name but he should be fourth choice atm.

263~~~
Stewart Gardner and Denis Irwin are saying that this will be the team that starts the season. Did they not just listen to the interview LvG gave.

264~~~
Depends on the type of #10 you want really. Van Gaal has said recently he wants his #10 to always score or create goals, he see's them more as a goal threat and forward (like Bergkamp for example) then a midfielder I think so that would go with Memphis playing there. Also I do think Memphis is going to be the left winger long term, but while Young is playing pretty well, then it's okay. Also, we are looking to buy Pedro, so our front 3 or 4 will be Mata, Pedro, Memphis behind Rooney, and those 3 can all rotate around.

265~~~
I may well be burying my head in the sand here, but I still think we'll soon go back to the 4-3-3 formation with Ander playing a major role in the system. He's a dynamic, goalscoring midfielder and Van Gaal fully knows how hard it is to find a player like him. There's no way he doesn't rate him.

266~~~
I don't blame him if he is. It was dumb from Fellaini, the sending off. Get sent off for reacting to provocation, two harsh yellows or a needed professional foul, not a cowardly, lazy tackle. LVG would have known he was bringing in at least one CM by that stage and Fellaini just made it easier for LVG to drop him.

267~~~
Basti is better than all 3. He should be first choice, not fourth.

268~~~
He is when he is in shape, he isn't at the moment.

269~~~
Is he that much of a goal scorer? I know he grabbed a few last season but I didn't think it was a big feature of his game before then. Plus I'm pretty sure he had a vey high conversion rate last year, so much so that you'd wonder if it was just a unsustainable purple patch.

270~~~
Well obviously. That goes for anyone.

271~~~
it is certainly 4-4-2 at some point, not a starting shape though, with winger like Mata it can't get any more rigid. Why can't we play no10 at no10 position, cener back at center back etc?

272~~~
Too logical.

273~~~
Some good long range passing that I haven't seen too much of him yet. Should really play in a 3 men midfield

274~~~
Thought he was nice and neat, not scared to get stuck in and helped out in front of that defence. We have a really good squad.

275~~~
LVG doesnt love him. He'll probably be sold in the winter. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

276~~~
Don't be silly. We have a really good squad and it could get even better.

277~~~
I must be in the vibe of the place. Leave me be. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

278~~~
I think the ones who came on did us proud. In a way they had the hardest job. To go and score two more goals was the icing on the cake.

279~~~
LVG doesn't seem to like him. Similar kind of to Di Maria.

280~~~
The manager probably rates him as a player in terms of quality but the system always comes first, he doesn't really fit the profile of the 8 which is more like a Strootman or Davids (or Bayern Schweinsteiger) nor does he fit the profile of the 10 which is a player like Muller or Litmanen.

As with Mata who doesn't fit the profile of a RW for Louis but has amazing quality he will adapt the role for him but he will likely be a rotation option,  he needs to perform better than Schneiderlin to get the 8 position and with Schweinsteiger alongside him I can see him doing that. A switch to 4-3-3 (point backwards) and I can see Herrera being the preferred most attacking central player, I can't see that happening though as even an injury to Depay would probably result in Januzaj playing the 10.

281~~~
Memphis has played the role pretty intelligently so far, but I just feel we could benefit from him on the left and Ander as the AM, rather than only having one or the other.

I can understand him wanting a goal scoring #10 as it alleviates the responsibility on Rooney, but Ander can add goals and then we'd get goals from Memphis on the left, something we don't really get from Young. I just feel we could get the best of both worlds.

282~~~
He's already said Valencia is his first choice RB with Darmian in 2nd and yet Darmian is in his "A team that will start every match" where as Valencia is in his "B team that he doesn't rate".

So just relax in regards to Herrera and others people...

283~~~
Valencia was coming back from injury though, wasn't he?

284~~~
They each played half of the match though, so he could have easily put him in the A team.

That or everyone is right and he doesn't rate Herrera at all.

285~~~
Wait what??

286~~~
'We have brought Darmian for the second position behind Valencia and now already because of injury, (Paddy) McNair has to play there.'

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3169167/Matteo-Darmian-second-choice-Antonio-Valencia-season-according-Manchester-United-boss-Louis-van-Gaal.html#ixzz3gyTPWUuR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...United-boss-Louis-van-Gaal.html#ixzz3gyTPWUuR</a>

287~~~
The A team played 65 minutes. It was clearly his preferred XI. Presumably he didn't want Valencia to play so many minutes in his first appearance after the injury. Either that or Darmian's performances on tour so far have pushed him up the pecking order.

288~~~
Suppose so, any way the point I was trying to make is people need to stop worrying too much about Herrera being in the B team, he is good enough, he will force his way in the first team.

289~~~
It must be taxing to prove yourself repeatedly. He already forced his way into our starting XI in the second half of the season, and was one of our best players. It's a bit preposterous if he is down the pecking order again and will need to prove himself this time too, if that is indeed the case.

290~~~
Every player in the squad has to constantly "prove himself". That's how competition for places works. Having signed two top class players that play the same position as him, Hererra will know that the competition for his place just got tougher. He's said as much himself.

291~~~
I want to die now.

292~~~
Darmian will overtake him soon.

293~~~
I like Darmian. It's pre-season though. We will have to see how he copes in the PL. That's a different animal.

294~~~
Ofcourse.

295~~~
It's concerning tbh and it doesn't bode well for squad progression if someone like Herrera has to prove himself all over again after the second half of the season he just had. We are supposed to be adding to the players that did well but all we've seen is Smalling and Herrera, two of our top five performers last season, being dropped down the packing order for no reason at all. Funny how Rooney isn't being asked to prove himself all over again despite showing a major technical flaw that is dragging the team backwards.

If this is how Van Gaal awards hard work then it's not that hard to see why, for such an obviously  brilliant football mind, he finds it difficult to hold down a job for more than two seasons. He is his worst enemy, imo.

It's apparent now that this season we will start pretty much the same as the last one, using shite formations to shoehorn his favourites leaking points like a sieve whilst our rivals steal the march on us. We need to start the season with what works to give us the best possible chance for success and those two are part of any Man Utd eleven that works.

296~~~
I know Herrera is a big favourite here but it's not like benching him in favour of the likes of Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Mata, Depay or (if we sign him) Pedro is a massive crime. We finally have a lot of quality in these positions so tough choices have to be made.

If we are playing with a proper #10 then I can certainly see why Herrera wouldn't be picked. As has been said before, LVG favours more of a direct attacking threat in that position.

297~~~
Poor guy.
Mistrusted by LvG, ought his way back to the team and played really well, and now bright new toys/new system have sidelined him again.
In the 4231 with 2 DMs, he can play the #10 with Memphis shifting to the Ronaldo-role on the left, but for some reason LvG likes this.
Also, long term, as much as I like Herrera, Pereira (or however it's spelt) seems to be the better prospect.

298~~~
Herrera has to be a fixture in our team if we hope to play some semblance of attacking, free-flowing, pacey football IMO. I'd say he's probably our most important midfielder now for that very reason. Following the acquisition of both Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger we now finally have viable replacements for Carrick, but I don't see anyone else in the team that can offer what Herrera has; that sense of urgency, directness and ability to drive the ball forward from deep. Schneiderlin has it to some extent I suppose but he's primarily a defensive player.

299~~~
If he doesn't start the season for any other reason apart the fitness(which I doubt will be the reason) van Gaal is an idiot.

300~~~
FFS could you lot possibly wait for the season to start instead of hysterically concluding that Herrera is off in the winter.

Its pre-season, if Herrera is still being benched come January, then we do have a cause for concern. Otherwise shut up and enjoy the start to the season.

301~~~
That's not something Hererra does at all.

302~~~
Ever think maybe Smalling and Herrera are in the '2nd half squad' to provide a bit of quality and leadership amongst so many youth players.

Doubt very much it's a black and white case of first and second choice.

Calm yourselves, some of these posts are tragic.

303~~~
I was just going to say that. There is no way he would throw 11 kids on in the 2nd half. The three experienced players as you say gave them a steady influence. We have a squad it will be utilised. The ones saying he will be sold in the winter. Oh yeah, just as we hit the business end of europe we sell one of our better players and obviously everyone knows there are going to be no injuries etc up to then. We are Manchester United just wait until they land back in Manchester, somebody will pick up an injury it is inevitable. Also I seem to remember everyone going overboard about our kids after last pre-season. Some will get there chance, some will be loaned out. Pre-season friendlies are great but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, experience counts.

304~~~
Would also explain why Basti was on the young team too.

305~~~
There's a reason why they were the ones there chosen "to provide quality and leadership". If both the first half and second half teams had a mix of young and senior players then there'd be no point in reading into it, but that's not what happened. The team in the first half was exclusively filled with players from the first team. The team in the second half was filled with players on the fringes (many of whom were young). Unfortunately Smalling and Herrera are on the fringes. I don't see any point in denying that.

306~~~
Conjecture.

Smalling is Van Gaals 1st choice CB imo, Hererra may have more competition this year but I don't think there's any cause for what's being said in here.

307~~~
I think Smalling is still first choice, but I can definitely see Jones doing that.  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

The Chicken Littles have been going a bit crazy over something that only seems logical when you look at the teams that LvG sent out.  We brought loads of attacking midfielders and wide players on tour and have less midfield options that can play as a 6/8.  The only other option was to play Fellaini and LvG didn't do that until Schweinsteiger was hurt.

308~~~
I jnust get the feeling LVG doesnt rate him. I think he wont play any game when the season starts. Even if 10 players get injured. Unlike all other players he works hard in training and this is how LVG awards that.. Baffling.

309~~~
I hope he gets into that advanced mid spot which Depay is occupying right now. His eye for a pass is wasted if he's playing deep. It would be a travesty if he doesn't start the first game.

310~~~
He said he wants two players for every position, so there will always someone will lose out in certain games. There will be games that suit Ander, games that suit Juan and the same with the midfield. It will only take the pace of the game to drop and the OT to start singing Attack, Attack and he will change it. Also we are bound to get injuries, we aren't Chelsea.

311~~~
Memphis-Herrera-Mata > Young-Memphis-Mata imo. Hope to see this tried out.

312~~~
Why are people so sure he'd be great in nr. 10 position and he should have a divine right for that spot?

313~~~
It's more Louis that said he was a No 10. I think he is more a No.8 tbh. Maybe Louis is in conversion mood again. The goalie signing has buggered his chances of being in goal. We will see anyway, the squad is definitely improving in quality now and should be capable of coping with any eventuality.

314~~~
I think he's more a nr. 8 too. But as I said I dont get that obsession about Herrera being nr. 10. Sure we must see it in practise but we havent seen it till now and many think it's perfect solution already.

315~~~
I don't think there's a #10 in a plain 4-3-3. The two wide forwards and one of the midfielders are expected to pitch in with the goals with the striker. The advanced mid fairly plays like a #8 ahead of the two holding players, which is what he has bought with the Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Carrick rotation.

The system he's been playing in the summer so far is a 4-4-1-1, which is again different from the 4-1-4-1 he played successfully at the end of last season.

316~~~
Hm I agree. 
I dont know thing with Herrera is that he can play multiple positions, even a holding pm, although as not as good as CM or nr. 10 or advanced mid.

317~~~
The difference between when he plays and when he doesn't is such a contrast.

We don't have our best 11 if herrera isn't in midfield imo, the second half against barca looked that much more aggresive because of him. Always going forward, always looking for his man. 

maybe that's why lvg likes to drop him.

318~~~
I dont think that's the case.

Also we looked agressive cause all the youngsters were agressive and active, not just him. 

Also as I said earlier in some other thread although he was great last season bigger difference was when we didnt have Carrick in the team, not Herrera.

319~~~
No one in the team has a divine right to any spot. Seen it suggested anywhere regarding Herrera as the #10? 

Regarding the 1st bit of your post, he has played there before in Spain. Also, whilst I agree he is better off as an 8, it's pretty evident that the middle 2 LVG is going for would be one of the 4 he named. Of our current #10 options, Mata and Herrera are the obvious 2. Memphis has played on the left most of his career and seeing as our 1st choice for the position currently is Young, we can easily upgrade the same. 

I feel Herrera adds to the team what no one else does. Brings a certain fluidity which is why I want him on the pitch. As things stand, unless we're chasing a game, it seems it's as a #10 or not at all.

320~~~
I think Pereira will be his competitor for that nr. 10 too. Or so I hope cause the kid looks good.

321~~~
I wouldn't call Herrera a #10 but I do think we should be playing 4-3-3 and he should be the attacking midfield we build around. I just don't see any weaknesses to his game that would stop him excelling there.

It's been pretty disappointing that Van Gaal hasn't given him a single minute in that position in pre-season. Depay seems to be his first choice for the role which is just bizarre given we signed him on the basis of his excellent performances on the left. I mean we really needed a new left winger, Young was our only decent option, for the central role we had tons of options. These head-scratching decisions of Van Gaal were a real problem for us last season.

322~~~
Herrera should be tried in nr. 10 in current formation or attacking mid in 4-3-3 but I dont have such a problem with Memphis playing centrally tbh.

323~~~
Said it before, but it's him + one other, it simply has to be. We'll continue to look like we lack ideas until Van Gaal realizes this again like what happened last season. Our most important midfielder right now, funny/sad that he'll start the season on the sidelines.

324~~~
He's the only CM of the main 4 that offers something different to compliment the strengths of the others, yet he's on the outside.

325~~~
Hasn't started a single pre-season game, the other first team midfielders have.

He's fecking LVG's wife isn't he? Zaha and Moyes all over again.

326~~~
He isn't physical enough to play holding midfielder under LvG, and a 4-3-3 point backwards doesn't suite us now that we have Schneiderlin who is more of an defensive box-to-box.

Let's see if he can nail down the spot behind the striker, for now though it looks like Memphis has it.

327~~~
Really can't believe we haven't tried him behind Rooney and Memphis wide and Young on the bench.

328~~~
Another season starting and the moaning about Herrera has started already, let's wait until the season starts. And Herrera's best position has always been as the most advanced midfielder in a 4-3-3, in that formation there's no such thing as a #10.

329~~~
I think van Gall doesnt like Ander because he is too much of a risk taker, he also has a habit of losing the ball in crucial positions. Despite that I think what he brings to the table is far more important.

330~~~
He is absolutely vital. He's the one who stands out amongst our array of midfield. One who can link up all together in forward positions and drive us on. 

Him not starting a single game in preseason is a bit strange and hopefully not an indication of things to come because for me despite our midfield for what he brings that the others don't he should be the first name on the team sheet out of our midfielders. Hoping LVG doesn't feck this one up but I'm not sure he won't.

331~~~
He's going to get dropped again until injuries or something force LvG to try him out in around Janauary and by then it'll be too late. Bizarre management

332~~~
Genius suggestion.  

(No sarcasm)

333~~~
Couldnt agree more, i just dont get why he has been sidelined.

334~~~
He hasn't started any pre season game and had the least minutes out of all our CM's. He isn't starting for spurs, smalling might replace jones.

335~~~
That's it everybody is certain he wont start till October or even worse November. 

Who knows maybe we'll sell him in winter TW.

336~~~
You can joke as much as you want though, but the fact remains that he isnt as highly rated as some think/wish. He isnt vital for LvG, even if he plays some games here and there. He wont be a starter at the start of the season, that is what i interpret from our tour.

337~~~
I'm not joking. Some posters seriously think and are certain he wont start till autumn based on preseason games which is a bit silly. 
Also LVG not liking him is silly too imo. 
People thought LVG doesnt like Mata and now Mata is undroppable.

338~~~
If all of Carrick, Morgan and Bastian are fit then he won't start before the Autumn, that's very probable.

Van Gaal doesn't rate Herrera as highly as the supporters or local media, that's abundantly clear by now.

339~~~
He is undroppable because we have no other better options. Herrera has much more quality players in front of him, although all more DMs. That is what van Gaal wanted and bought 2 new midfielders, while just buying Depay as our LW or 10 now, while not buying anyone for the right side.

340~~~
This is true too. LVG dropping someone doesn't mean he dislikes them, it just means he doesn't think they fit into his first 11 atm.

Right now Herrera isn't playing because there's a lot of competition at CM and he isn't really a #10. That doesn't mean he isn't rated for what he is though.

341~~~
We have a lot of games and I'm sure Herrera will feature in a lot of them. It just seems Redcafe will have a huge meltodn every time he gets dropped, for even one game. And he could have a bad game or 2, that's possible.

342~~~
That might even be a risk. He has been sat on his backside most of the time.

343~~~
We don't know what he has been told. I presume he has been given reassurances that he will get gametime. LvG is pretty honest with players that way. He usually tell them how it is, so you would think Ander is happy with what he has been told.

344~~~
No one knows that for sure, either way, we'll see.

345~~~
I really hope this is the case and that LvG's told him it's just been about trying to get Schneidsteiger as many minutes as possible with the team for now.

Otherwise it raises some bad/weird questions about LvG.

346~~~
Maybe that's why he doesn't start?

347~~~
I'd like to see him at DM.

348~~~
Didn't really have an impact on the game unfortunately.

349~~~
Was screaming for him to come on and he didn't really do anything.

350~~~
Next game please:

--------------------Rooney
--Memphis-----Herrera-----Mata
------------Schweinsteiger
---------------------Schneiderlin
Shaw-----Blind----------Smalling----Darmian
--------------------Romero

351~~~
It was 20 minutes in the first game, with hardly any playing time in pre-season. There were ones on the pitch the whole match who hardly made an impact. Very few of them did. Smalling, Darmian and Romero were the only ones I was impressed with. Carrick and Morgan did their job, but there was nothing creative coming from them mostly. Young ran a lot but his end product is still dire at times. Memphis ran around, took shots, mostly off target. They had a lot back, so we are back to the old cannot break down an organised defence. Rooney was abysmal. Mata worked hard, but can be knocked off the ball easily. If Kyle Walker has you in your pocket you aren't playing well.

352~~~
No. Herrera is not a #10 and will not perform well in that role. United should not even be playing with a number 10. It does not bring the best out of our squad to be playing with a double pivot. Herrera should be the right sided midfielder in a 4-3-3. If he was he'd be much more effective than he was today.

353~~~
Hope you're joking.

354~~~
Exactly he needs to be in a midfield 3. With Carrick/Bastian and Morgan. Then Memphis wide, Rooney and Mata. What is difficult about that. The defence still has it protection, but someone is linking the midfield to the attack.

355~~~
Let me elaborate. I think in the 4231 we were employing he would add a lot at DM. The key of course will be whether he would be given permission to get into the box. Him alongside Morgan would make a good pairing. Michael and Morgan seem to be a bit too defensive for my liking. Bastian went a bit more forward than I was expecting which was great to see.

356~~~
he could play there easily, he bossed the chelsea game from the back, now on double pivot he would have all time to set up attacks with Morgan covering and providing legs, both players could overrun anyone but Van Gaal rather fancies Herrera further up the pitch where currently is Depay  who is completely lost there. Funny how we started experimenting with that all of a sudden with a new player and he never had a particularly great game. We could say he was decent there but our overall game lacked too much fluidity. Insane manager.

357~~~
I expected that he didnt start but I was fecking furious when he was brought in as a straight swap for Memphis, he cant play right behind the striker. His main quality is moving the ball up front with speed after receiving it from the two DMs, should be played deeper ahead of the two DMs imo.

358~~~
Disagree, has mental lapses at DM, don't really think he has the concentration needed. Let Hazard go for the goal against Chelsea in that away fixture.

359~~~
But he was playing there as a the lone DM. You don't think he would cut it alongside Morgan?

360~~~
He could with someone beside him.

361~~~
Position he played today is exactly a position he should play in.

362~~~
We'll see if we sign Pedro, but right now it's tough to argue that we have good enough wingers to keep Herrera out. Memphis out left, Mata coming in off the right and Herrera doing his best Lampard impression as our 10. He's mobile, works hard and makes clever off the ball runs. He'd give us more than Young did and Memphis will do better on the left than as a 10.

Worst case, we get a defensively solid midfield via pressing (Schneiderlin does that well too) rather than just sitting off.

363~~~
I love herrera but I don't think he's a good option for a classic #10 in our system at all. He's not enough of a goal threat and you lose his main qualities by playing him there. He's a box to box midfielder, and you want him in the middle of the pitch, not being the main playmaker or right behind the striker. He's capable, but Memphis is a lot more suited to that position in terms of strength, hold up play, dribbling and goal threat and creativity. Herrera should be starting of course, just deeper in midfield, not in the hole.

364~~~
What would you say are his main qualities?

365~~~
Apparently he got a solid bollocking from Frans Hoek towards the end of the game, anyone know why?

366~~~
Think the MEN mentioned it too. It was positioning I think. He went running beyond Rooney up front.

367~~~
Looks like he wanted us to score, who'd have thought it.

368~~~
Or who knows. Crazy. But maybe he has done something wrong. 
Far fetched I know.

369~~~
Running beyond Rooney could be deceiving because Wayne does drop quite deep naturally. Probably not totally Ander's fault.

370~~~
He might have done in their eyes, but what they think is wrong and what we think is wrong might be two different things. It's interesting in that MEN articles Luckhurst says Ander was free in space and instead of passing the ball to him Ashley Young passed it to Rooney. Surely if someone is free you pass it to them. No wonder we are struggling to create. Passing for the sake of it to no effect. Some of the players are cowards and are taking the easy option just to keep the boss happy. Yet he is quite happy for his defenders to piss about at the back passing it backwards and forwards. Surely that is more risky.

371~~~
All that from some article? and from one instance when Young didnt pass it to Herrera?

372~~~
What I am getting at is not looking at the best option but the easy option. The forward players should be the ones who are allowed to take risks. You can't have just one player doing it. The defenders you want to be dependable, the goalkeeper you want to be dependable and the midfielders sitting in front of the defence the same. Once it gets further up the field we should then be moving about quickly to create space. We are so slow it is easy to defend against. This seems like deja vu.

373~~~
Look all I'm saying is maybe Herrera has done something wrong. I know its brave to say that here where Herrera is regarded as near saint but there you are.

374~~~
Frans Hoek seems to be talking a lot to him after games. It is a positive sign, they want him to do well. 

He gets shafted around quite a bit, played all 3 positions last year and this year seems to be again the number 10 after playing most of the time as an 8 last year.
I feel a  bit for him, will be hard to nail a place down, especially with this 4-4-2 setup.

375~~~
Hm. I think with the potential addition of Pedro, Herrera falls further down the pecking order as Mata is then fighting for AM as well and hes currently a better option. Offers more offensively.

I would guess Herrera was told to sit and not go forwards. Obviously only a guess, but for all his "effort" Herrera isn't very good tactically when it comes to the defensive side of the game. He tends to charge about a bit, rather than thinking about his positioning.

376~~~
I might be wrong here but iirc, Herrera himself admitted to that as an adaptation problem he was having with LvG's philosophy.

I think he cited Bielsa having coached them to go "chasing/pressing the ball" whereas LvG is all about being in the right position/shape, all the time.

So yeah, he was even more defensively in-disciplined (according to LvG's philosophy) but I think its a bit harsh to call it "not very good tactically/defensively"....because tactically/defensively in Bielsa's system, that entire Athletic side was amazing.

It's definitely his adaptation to a completely different system which caused him problems. He seems an extremely "intelligent" footballer. So I have high hopes for our midfield, if we manage to get them all playing on the same wavelength.

377~~~
Yeah that is deifinitely a better way of putting it.

Its funny really. A lot of people are going crazy about Herrera not starting but actually, what a great position to be in, having such a strong midfield.

Fingers crossed we can get them playing together.

378~~~
Yeah, I don't mind who starts - as long as the lineup makes a bit more sense like....playing players in their best position etc.

Also, the only thing which really grates me is players like Smalling/Herrera, who were 2 of our best performers last season, seemingly having to prove themselves over and over again. Whilst 1 or 2 others seem to get a bit of a pass whenever they're fit.

But yeah, that's another debate. Like you said, let's hope the players start clicking soon! It could be great to watch.

379~~~
T'is a good point. Good thing Smalling played on Saturday. Would have been odd to see possibly three of our most impressive players from last season (De gea, Smalling and Herrera) all not playing. Hoping Herrera starts on Friday.

380~~~
was our best cm last season, he doesn't need more time to adapt. Should be starting. 

even elk born on twitter said it's so obvious that LVG could get more fluid attacking play by bringing on herrera and shifting memphis wide and that the only reason he hasn't done that is because he still doesn't trust the defence.

381~~~
I was surprised when my mate told me on Sunday about our Friday night kick off! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Looking forward to it now. Something different.

Yeah, it would give us good control in the middle of the park, in a difficult away fixture, if we have 3 of Schw, Schn, Carrick and Herrera in there (preferably not Carrick and Schw together). 

But I can still see the Memphis experiment continuing. Hopefully it either works out soon, or we change things up if it doesn't. Just as long as we don't drop any unnecessary points whilst experimenting. Hence I think Ander will be a sub again.

382~~~
True. I didn't really consider the time of the match in my original post. We were definitely shutting up shop so you are probably right.

383~~~
That is likely right, pity we feel we have to sit back against a pretty average Spurs. Hopefully as the teams form picks up we can let the players have their heads a bit.

384~~~
Probably his energy/pressing, great touch, quick passing to increase the tempo of the game and picking out a man in front, but the more creative players who will(should) create chances, and do little 1-2's to get around the opposition, and his ability to get stuck in and win the ball back. He's a very good outlet to pass the ball to when the midfield is under pressure as he is a quick passer and one little pass out to the right back from him and a few of the opposition are out of position and we can start an attack. He's a pretty creative player himself of course, and he's good at dribbling past a couple of defenders, but it's different in the way Memphis would, and it's more through his smart movement that he gets in a position to score, he picks his moments, compared to Memphis who will get in a goalscoring chance a few times a game. Van Gaal likes his #10's to be the main or second main source of goals/assists, and have all of our attacking play go through them basically. Herrera is a class player, but it just doesn't suit him to play there especially in our system. At least not from the start. He'd just be much better off playing deeper where he can influence the game more.

385~~~
The way I understand it so far is that Herrera doesn't start because he is too attacking minded and lacks the tactical discipline LvG wants from his players. I would argue though that we could do with a player or two who are just holding their position for 90 minutes. I would favour a return to the 4-3-3 of last season with him and Schneiderlin in front of either Carrick or Schweinsteiger. I feel this would offer us way more in terms of going forward than what we are playing right now but it seems that LvG wants his two defensive mids at any cost. Maybe it's because he wants a PL title in those 3 years he has left and favours a more conservative approach because of it or maybe he just still doesn't trust our defence to do a good job, which I can't really blame him for.

386~~~
Problem is I think most of them are trying to hold their positions which is likely why the attacks look so futile.

387~~~
Exactly. There is barely any movement in the team from deeper position. Carrick and Schneiderlin just sit in fron of the defence. The FBs barely move forward, Memphis usually is too high up the pitch to be involved in any kind of build up and it all falls to Young and Mata to make something happen. That's just simply not enough to get through PL-Team defences in most cases. We need that movement from deeper positions that someone like Herrera brings into the team.

388~~~
Meh says people in the west.

389~~~
Okay. I agree with some of the strengths to his game.

Obviously van Gaal knows 100 times more than me, but I still don't like they way he's setting us up at all.

We have two sitters, two forwards who can't create (and would rather stick to getting the final touch), and two wingers who can't beat their man. It's as if we're set up to keep the ball, create very little, and if we bundle the ball into the goal somehow, through having two forwards... then it's job done.

When you suffocate teams, I think it makes sense to have someone like Herrera ahead of the sitters. He's our most creative player, he can sit on the ball, he isn't focused on scoring goals. I also think he can dribble past men better than Memphis in the congested centre.

Memphis and Rooney as a front two would be brilliant, if we played counter-attacking football, because it requires less creativity and holding of the ball.

I guess we'll have to see who else comes in, and where they all line up, but the team he chose on Saturday was always going to struggle to create chances. I don't know... maybe he's planning to release Schweinsteiger.

Edit: and I don't see Mata as an option in the centre, because he struggles to hold the ball, dribble, create too much.

390~~~
Hey man! You had me up at shitty times during preseason <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Yeah, yeah, I know. The entire competitive calendar is shit for you guys. So I have no reason to complain! I'm just messing about.

391~~~
To me this is the main issue. Leicester last year knocked the idea of ADM in the middle and we went a lot more safe since then. We haven't reinforced the defence, and while the base of midfield is stronger and offers more protection than last season the defence is still a huge question mark.

392~~~
That makes sense, now there's no way he'll be part of that midfield 3 for a while.

393~~~
Good point about our defense. Raises the question why we haven't strenghtened the CB position though.

394~~~
Sorry I can be a strange bugger. Slipped my mind completely to respond!

I think the depay experiment will continue as well. He probably needs a goal to let the shackles off a bit with respect to the new position. I think left wing is a position which involves less burden whereas in the middle you jBe to be so much more aware and adept in tight spaces.

I would have quite liked the Friday night match, but I'm shifting that day so might have to watch it the next day.

395~~~
FFS, sorry you're missing the match. I'm never able to watch the next day - I can't wait for the score, so I'm always following text or live updates if im unable to watch!

I'd love us to give either Ander or Mata an extended run out in the side at #10.

396~~~
Happy 26th birthday. Hope it's a good one and enjoy your cake.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

397~~~
Happy birthday Ander! One of my favourite UTD players

398~~~
Happy birthday Ander! 
Hope LVG will make you a cake.

399~~~
Ander will start today I think. van Gaal will be looking at Brugge and he'd want 2 of Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin or Carrick for that.

400~~~
Not brilliant at Villa but what Herrera added when he came on was that ability to link play. Suddenly we began moving the ball in one touch, there was a bit of zip to our play. When it comes to playing #10 there will be other players more naturally inclined to run in behind, to support the striker, to make late runs into the box to score. However, if you want a #10 who is going to drop deep and support your other midfielders, play off them, and find ways to move the ball forward Ander is your guy.

401~~~
We look much better with him on the pitch. That last 30 minute team is a much better side.

402~~~
Needs to play every match, daft that he doesn't.

403~~~
That's the type of midfield options we have now. Great isn't it? Even bringing subs on doesn't weaken us. In fact it enhances us.

404~~~
We're just so much better with 3 in midfield. I hope he will start as an AM soon

405~~~
Really hope he starts against Brugge.

406~~~
Hoping we see him starting now. LVG in his post match seems to think our performance was better after we made the substitutions so here's hoping he includes Ander in the mix from now on...

407~~~
Think he's a cert to start vs Brugge.

408~~~
"I like a second striker in that position more than a third midfielder. That is why, for example, Herrera is not playing but is always coming in because he is more of a controlling midfielder there." van Gaal after tonight <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

409~~~
Stronger, more athletic and more dynamic than anyone else we have tried in the role so far, yet it seems he's destined to be used as the sub.

410~~~
He and Schneiderlin already seem to be on the same page more often than not. I'd forgotten what a midfield that links up with the attack looked like (except for that one crazy game against City with Anderson and Cleverley).

411~~~
Confirms what i thought initially in pre season. Van Gaal doesnt have a place for him in our current setup.

He prefers different midfielders and different players behind our striker, which leaves him on the bench currently.

412~~~
I think people need to take a cold shower. Herrera did almost exactly nothing in the entire time he was on the pitch. The play didn't improve in anyway, he didn't create any chances. It was a nothing performance and didn't demonstrate any reason why he should kick a different player out of the team.

413~~~
If he prefers a striker in that number 10 then Herreea needs to be one of the 2 central mids.

Just because he good at attacking does not mean he's not goid defensively, he has a very solid workrate and puts himself into tackles.

He is the link between the midfield and attack we need to avoid the long ball after long ball from our deep midfielders problem.

414~~~
He really wasn't very good tonight. I'm a big fan of his but it's very tedious reading the very predictable "has to be playing" posts whenever he makes an appearance, even though it doesn't reflect anything he did, only the narrative.

Memphis looked far more dangerous centrally which is what you want from your AM when you only have 1 striker which is exactly the point Van Gaal seems to be making.

415~~~
Yep. It leaps off the screen. The front 2 should be him + another for the next game, I think. Give him time in the role and he'll figure out how to change what he needs to in order to be more effective, but having mobility and the ability to turn away from an opponent with a first touch puts him one up on Rooney right now. 

Writing that, there's also a case for Pereira getting a shot if we continue to look toothless. He'll give the ball away but he can come to the ball and then beat his marker at times, which would help.

416~~~
Sounds better for Fellaini than Herrera.

417~~~
I'd love to see Ander get the start against Brugge, LvG has tried Memphis and Adnan as starters there so giving Ander a starting shot is the next logical move IMO. I can see Pereira getting his chance at it in the Capital 1 cup.

418~~~
That exactly what I've seen (the play did improve but Bastian had a bigger impact for me) but seems the caf has made up their mind that he should start every game.

Herrera should look to compete for the number 8 role instead of 10 IMO.Bastian-Herrera would be interesting to try out (did well together in the first game of pre-season).

419~~~
Hererra wasn't incredible, but he did have 32 touches in only half-an-hour which is really good for a #10. It shows how well he made himself available for a pass.

The effect he had was to give his teammates an out-ball at all times, whilst raising the tempo with the speed of his passing. It may have been a bit of a 'vanilla' performance, but he's the <i>type </i>of player we've been missing sorely for much of the opening games. If we aspire to be a possession team, we need someone like that high up the pitch. Without that, the ball moves around too slowly for us to even contemplate opening teams up. If he'd started the match, I'm confident we'd have created a lot more chances.

BTW, I've not made my mind up about anything. I was keen to see Memphis in the hole at the start of the season. But looking at the way things have gone, I leaning more towards Herrera right now. Our lack of tempo is what's holding us back and Herrera is our best fix for it.

420~~~
Bit weird to say that the play didn't improve after he came on. We were under a lot of pressure for the first bit of the second half - when we made our subs we took control of the game again and played our best football of the game. I'm not at all saying that was because of Herrera, but there was a noticeable shift and we saw the game out comfortably.

421~~~
I have to agree with this. I don't think that he was very good when he came on. 

Schneiderlin-Herrera or Schweinstiger-Herrera would form a good partnership in the system we are trying to play, imo. Don't mind him at number 10 either, especially for the tougher games where you need more to control the midfield.

422~~~
When Herrara first came I was in awe of his defense splitting passes. I feel with Van gaal he has been over coached about the point of possession, it has strained his creativity and you could notice it in the past couple games. Against Villa when he came on, he received the ball in the hole and he immediately started looking to his sides and behind him for retention. He missed every run that our wingers were making inside, and really if he's not going to attempt those passes, what's the point in having him as a #10? It's a shame.

423~~~
I don't rate him as a no.10. I would like to see him more as a B2B, such a complete player should be playing there.

But the problem is that we don't really play with a box to box these days and he might be down the picking order for the 2 DM positions, I wouldn't be surprised to see that Fellaini will also be ahead of him when he returns for those 2 positions.

424~~~
Me neither and i agree on the rest.

425~~~
It's been evident but still sad to hear that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

426~~~
I thought he was pretty decent myself and in tandem with Schweinsteiger (mostly Schweini though) helped gain control of the midfield. Played a few nice passes and made a few mistakes but most importantly gave us a wee bit more energy, pressing off the ball and some tempo. Maybe it wasn't as good as I'm making it out to be but in relative to our rather tentative play until the 60th minute, it did look a lot better that it should perhaps. Januzaj didn't have a great game but got the winner nonetheless. I think we do not have a top notch #10/second-striker (unless Depay changes his game drastically or maybe LVG is in favour of trying out Mata there), so we might as well play to our strengths and play with a midfield trio with Herrera as the most advanced of the trio.

Rooney being isolated might be a bit of a problem though and that might be why LVG is insistent on using a #10/SS, to add a bit of a goal threat.

427~~~
We effectively played 4-3-3 after Herrera came on. Basti was mostly operating on the left of centre midfield, Ander on the right, with Morgan between. He was the one expected to step out but he was playing as a 'controlling midfielder', to quote Van Gaal from last night. Van Gaal's comments about how well he thought we played after the subs, coupled with his criticism of Januzaj's ball losses, make me feel he was laying the ground to drop Adnan for Ander next week. Wouldn't be surprised to see Herrera start next Tuesday night.

428~~~
Yep. He did the simple things right - made himself available for a pass, retained the ball well, defended well and didn't do anything stupid in general. Januzaj and Depay didn't really do any of that very well and the manager criticised them for that, so you'd have to think he'd be most pleased with Herrera's performance. In an ideal world he'd be playing with someone like Litmanen in there, but we don't have that. Herrera or Fellaini are our two best options there on the basis of this and last season.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/afqc6n7hlA4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Schweinsteiger was obviously the key but Herrera played a significant part. If you compare Herrera and Januzaj it seems pretty clear - Herrera had more touches, more dribbles and almost twice as many passes in half the time. Januzaj didn't help us control the game and didn't offer much in attack either.

429~~~
Peoples idea of taking control of a game is scoring more goals, LvG's is getting back control of the possession in a game. This was what Bastian and Ander did. You will all have to wait for the fluid attacking game. All LvG wants is points, nothing more atm will keep him happy. His subs did exactly what he asked them to. He will be more annoyed that others in the starting lineup didn't.

430~~~
Herrera is a must for me great pressing/tackling , links the attack and midfield well and great support for strikers around the edge of the box . With the energy that Schneiderlin brings to the team it bodes well for the future . I would like both of them playing with one of Schweinsteiger or Carrick . No doubt Schweinsteiger or Carrick will pick up a knock and Van Gaal will stumble on his best midfield line up .

431~~~
I like Herrera, but he wasn't as good as many made him to be.

432~~~
Hm. I'm not sure he's more athletic than Depay. Or stronger. Or more dynamic. I'm not sure any of those are key attributes for a number 10 anyway. More attributes of a "number 8", where Schneiderlin seems to be excelling at present.

Personally i'd have Mata playing in the middle with Schmidfield behind him. He proved again last night how good he is at making killer passes and creating chances and he did that on the rare occasions he drifted inside. Imagine depay and pedro running off the flanks with Mata threading balls through. He offers more of a goal threat than Herrera as well. 

That midfield three would offer plenty of resistance, strength and creativity.

That said, its a long season and whilst Herrera is a sub in my preferred line up, he will start plenty of games when we need to rotate and keep players fresh. He may start on Tuesday with Schmidfield.

433~~~
He's more agile than Memphis and has shown just as much strength on the ball, I also think his superior technique makes him more dynamic when turning quickly to try and initiate attacks. I'd also say these things are important in the role in the PL as the ball is pressed relentlessly and while we saw Mata make a couple of nice passes last night we also saw how he can't protect the ball and is easily hustled off it as he's so slow and weak.

434~~~
I actually think Memphis would be better if he got rid of some of the leg muscle.

435~~~
Yeah I saw this too. But it wasn't just him Yesterday, a lot of our players missed the runs Depay made.

436~~~
Why do I sense that LVG screams at this guy the most? As others have said I hope he isn't getting over coached.

437~~~
That's an interesting point, he is built like a 100M sprinter.

438~~~
Which is fine if you are just running fast in a straight line, but he isn't he's a footballer.

439~~~
lol if you couldn't see the difference then you should really watch the game again. It wasn't the best performance but his presence on the pitch means we looked much better in possession and in transition to attack, he's always available and his great movement and ability to tirelessly press players. The difference was obvious.

440~~~
It wasn't a great performance at all but Villa were getting away with murder all game long. They kicked feck out of Januzaj then, when he went off, kicked feck out of Hererra instead. With a stronger ref they would have both made more of an impression.

441~~~
That was really pissing me off. It was like some sort of kick an AM a minute competition.

442~~~
He gave the ball away too much. Still, he provides a better balance to the midfield. Would like to see him start with Morgan and instead of Carrick in the next home game.

443~~~
He's too sloppy at the ball,  unpredictable and dynamic but i can see why lvg dont like him.  He seems to take initiative by himself and noy sticking to lvg game plan?

444~~~
Possibly my favorite player at the club. He makes the midfield work.

Pass, move, makes himself available for a pass. Receive. Pass again. Rinse and repeat.

We haven't had someone do that in our midfield since Cleverley 2012 (before his injury). He basically causes the entire attack and midfield to shift towards the opposition box. Less pressure on the wingers to dribble their way into the opposition area.

The only reason I can see LvG not liking him is that he can sometimes get dispossessed easily.

445~~~
Well yeah, he seems to do that, but thats for me positive if a player takes initiative. I know LvG has his philosophy, but he shouldnt have bought him if he doesnt fit in. He was a club target, but he still gave his ok. We waste him quite a bit, i wish van Gaal would realsie that Ander deserves more freedom and that he helps us in  terms of creativity/space/movement.

446~~~
So can Mata, so this can't be the reason.

447~~~
I'd love to try a midfield three of Schweinsteiger, Herrera & Mata in one of the next couple of home games. The biggest weakness in my opinion that's been a feature of our play this season is our slow build up play and players taking too many touches/having a poor first touch. Schweinsteiger and Herrera are excellent in this regard and Mata is our most creative player. Put Januzaj on the right (or Pedro if he joins) and Depay on the left and you should have a really dynamic front 6.

448~~~
The reason is that he is a midfielder and not an attacker. In the #10 position, Herrera plays like a very attacking #8, while Van gaal is after a very attacking #10.

449~~~
It could be mate. LVG is said to have quota of players who can take risks. Maybe Mata is in that group and Herrera is not.

450~~~
No, because the quota is 4 players.

451~~~
ive seen a lot of people saying that it was Sweinsteiger the gained the control of the match but I think that the biggest change in the game was Herrera against villa. Firstly, Herrera brings energy to the side that without him we just lack. What I mean by this is that with Herrera, the press of the team is much higher and much faster overall, this allows the ball to be challenged higher up the pitch and so when you get it your closer to the oppositions box. For me this is a huge factor and makes us far more dangerous. 

On top of this added pressing in the side, I also think that Herrera just shifts the ball quicker than most of our other players and in doing so rasies the whole tempo of the side. There is a reason that when Herrera plays, mata comes alive because they are both intelligent players that can provide that creative spark in the team. 

I really thought Herrera changed the game on Friday and again showed why he has to be the first name on the team sheet for me. I'm hoping that against Bruge on Tuesday we start with both Herrera and Sweinsteiger in midfield to really give us abit more control and creativity.

452~~~
I hope LvG gets the balance right on Tuesday, yes we don't want to be conceding, but we need at least two goals. Without any creativity and tempo in the side I am not sure where the goals will come from.

453~~~
What a week that was.

454~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

455~~~
I like Herrera, but my word he has to be the most overrated player on this forum. Gets praised over anything and everything.

I do hope he starts, but I don't think his performance against Villa will convince LVG that he should.

Also, what the feck does overcoaching even mean?

456~~~
LVG also said that Depay, Januzaj, Rooney and a few others had lost possession too many times. If that was the problem it wouldn't just be Herrera who suffered.

Anyway, we already know exactly what the problem is. He doesn't play at #10 because he isn't a #10, especially in LVG's eyes. He doesn't play as a holding midfielder because he isn't a holding midfielder either and faces very strong competition from Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin. It's not particularly complicated.

457~~~
He'll get his chance at some point. Plenty of games this season.

458~~~
If I may, he is a potential #10 in LVG's eyes, but he is the other type of #10, the midfielder type. When LVG presented his nederland team to the press, he showed two formations, one was a 4-3-3 where he chose Sneijder and the other was a 4-2-3-1 and he chose Van der Vaart.

459~~~
I don't get you. Isnt Mata in the group of 4??

460~~~
Mata is in the quota, with Herrera, the striker and the other winger.

461~~~
Ok.

462~~~
Aye, you're right actually. I don't think #10 is his best position anyway but it is more that he's not LVG's preferred type of #10 rather than him not being someone he would play as a #10 at all.

Problem is, we're probably going to be relying on our 10 to really help Rooney with the weight of goal scoring, which demands a certain type of player.

463~~~
More like a month but yeah I get your point.

464~~~
The match was turned by schweinsteiger. Once he came on he dictated play and let Schneiderlin do his thing. Herrera didn't do a lot imo. He wasn't bad or anything but he didn't do anything spectacular but schweinsteiger was all over the pitch. He even overlapped Rooney once or twice in the wing. He was undoubtedly the one that changed the game. 

That would be suicidal. There are no human shields in that midfield. At least a Fellaini has to be there in a midfield. Schneiderlin and Herrera is ideal with schweini or Carrick at the base

465~~~
Have to agree with the general point here.

Schneiderlin judging from the first couple games should be starting every match. Carrick/Bastian can rotate beside him.

466~~~
I worry about him because I don't think he suits the way LVG wants his number 10/am to play and it's probably the same problem Mata has in that LVG wants them pushed quite high and so they end up having to play with their back to goal far more that they would like and it doesn't suit their games. When he's played bursting forward from midfield he's been excellent. He links up with players well, runs in to space and gets in to the box well. As a third midfielder, being the main support I think he'd do well for us but playing closer to the striker than the midfield where he has to come and get the ball facing away from goal I don't think suits him. 

I hope LVG changes his mind as I think one of Herrera/Mata as a 3rd midfielder with Depay and likely Pedro on the flanks has a lot going for it imo.

467~~~
I'd like to think a home game against either Brugge or Newcastle at home would be a perfect situation not to have to play a destroyer.

468~~~
Didn't LVG say we looked better when Schweini and Herrera came in. Maybe based on that he'll start both of them on Tuesday.

469~~~
This was said in the PL games thread. I agree with him.

470~~~
Poor Ander cant start a game this season after doing so well last season. The problem is it will be difficult for him to shine because even when he comes in he plays as the second striker which is not his MO. The system LvG chose for this season does not suit Herrera IMO.

471~~~
Yep and our full backs! It's our front 3 that is lacking and another centre back!

472~~~
With the additional CL games this season, I really hope he'll get more than his fair share. 

Wonder how long it'll take for LvG to figure out that Herrera, Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger in midfield is the way forward.

473~~~
If he gets Pedro it could happe. Memphis, Rooney and Pedro as a front 3. All that pace out wide. At the moment Mata is there with no pace.

474~~~
Under LVG his days are numbered.

475~~~
He will be gone next summer.

476~~~
Of course they are, that was clear since pre season. But i guess LvG didnt play him because he was a sure starter <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

477~~~
He'd be the first guy on my team sheet every week. Really hope that he can force his way back in to the side but I don't see it happening long term, such a shame.

478~~~
I wonder what side we will use on Wednesday? This has been a hard game for us then Swansea next weekend, which I am seriously worried about.

479~~~
Our midfield has not been terrible without him. Herrera is just a product of bad management because he has not gotten an opportunity to impose himself into our first team. We are reaping what we sow by having so many midfielders in our team. As a result of that, we are neglecting one of our better midfielder surpringly.

480~~~
fecking mind-numbingly bizarre as to why he isn't playing.

481~~~
We may as well sell him, could recoup quite a bit of cash.

482~~~
Meh, not playing Herrera isn't what's costing us atm, our midfield is fine.

483~~~
In games at home against the likes of Newcastle, we need an attacking midfielder on the pitch who can create or score a goal. Instead we insist on only playing defensive minded midfielders. It's a travesty that Ander Herrara didn't play a second today.

484~~~
He is one who can score or create a goal.

485~~~
Should have replaced Adnan for me.

Why can't this guy get a game, mind boggling.

486~~~
All those sideways passes are certainly helping us score.

487~~~
The play him instead of Rooney, he couldn't be any worse.

488~~~
He should be playing as an 8 not as a 10. The reason why he can't get a game is simple. We have too many midfielders and I foresaw this when we bought both Schwienstiger and Schnerderlin. Van Gaal prefers solidarity and organization rather than the creativity and unorthodox movement of Herrera.

489~~~
And an overly cautious manager who doesn't like his midfield taking chances.

490~~~
I would argue he would have had a better impact on the game had he came on instead of Carrick or Chica in whichever position.

491~~~
Yea, I just added that as I forgot to further elaborate.

I agree, he would have been a better sub to bring on than Carrick.

492~~~
Should've came on for Schneiderlin

493~~~
Aye, that's the real problem atm.

People want Herrera to play so whenever we have a bad result they'll say we'd have done much better if we had played Herrera. In reality the likes of Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Carrick are doing well in midfield, it's our lack of finishing power that's killing us.

494~~~
Carrick did well when he came on but baffling as to why Herrera sat on the bench for the duration of the 90

495~~~
The Swansea game will be a good indicator if we are progressing. We lost twice to them last season and I am just worried they could rip us a new one.

496~~~
Pretty much, though tbf Carrick won't be here much longer and Schweinsteiger is hardly Mr. Durable either, so it makes sense to have that extra depth I guess. Sucks for Herrera though.

497~~~
The midfield base is defintiely fine, but the man ahead of them should be Herrera or Mata. One is out of position. The other can't get on the pitch.

498~~~
I'd give him a chance on the right, and bring Mata in as a #10.

Rooney needs dropped pronto.

499~~~
Should have been on instead of Carrick

500~~~
Still want to see him at DM alongside Schneiderlin.

501~~~
He shouldn't be a DM surely. He can either play with Carrick or Schweini but as Morgan is important for us he can play with Morgan a bit behind and as a nr. 8. Or instead of Adnan in nr. 10 which he played in first 2 league games when he was subbed on. 
Although Carrick had a good game Herrera should have come in instead of Schweini.

502~~~
Think he can bring so much more to the game if he's played in a central midfield role alongside Carrick or Schneiderlin etc as he can get on the ball deeper and play those passes or arrive late in the box etc, could be another Scholes type player if given the chance.

503~~~
Question: could Herrera perform the right wing play make role better than Mata?

504~~~
have no idea why you lot aren't playing him - he should be starting alongside Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin

505~~~
I don't think so to be honest

506~~~
Crossed my mind today. I think he could play it, not sure if better than Mata. If nothing he'd loose the ball less than Mata.

507~~~
Sounds too simplistic - it must be a ruse!

508~~~
No, Mata has been doing it really well these first 4 games despite what people think. I love herrera, but he should only be competing in the midfield 2 or the #10 role... Or just switch back to a midfield 3 and play him there.

509~~~
Carrick/ Schneiderlin
                           Herrera                     Bastian/Fellaini
               Mata                                                           Depay
                                               Rooney 

This is the same way we played towards the end of last season when we played the best. But LVG goes and fecks it up again, instead of sticking to something which works.

510~~~
I love Mata there. I still feel though that Herrera would offer us extra pace there,  is more creative than Mata, would be on his natural crossing side, would enable us to employ Mata as a second striker, in his favoured number ten role and would enable us exploit the superb understanding he and Herrera possess. Not to mention Herrera's eye for goal.

511~~~
If thats his only way into the team then I'm all for it. Baffles me that he's fallen out of favour this season, especially after fighting his way back last season. Really odd.

512~~~
Hope he plays on wednesday tbh

513~~~
Doubt he will, it'll be a very safe cautious match. 

I can accept LvG not starting him and going for the more solid base who just recycle the ball but if we're chasing a goal he should be the first one on.

514~~~
He fell out of favour because of the tip of the diamond that LVG favours tactically being shifted forward from the tip being behind two AMS like it was at the back end of last season. Firstly, to better protect the defence and secondly, to better control the midfield. LVG also prefers a second striker to operate in that role when the tip is ahead of two controllers (Hence trying Memphis there and now Januzaj in the role). Thus, since he views Herrera as a controling midfielder rather than a second striker, Herrara is now competing with Schweinstieger, Carrick and Schneiderlin for the two deeper controlling roles behind the tip and its hurt his chances of starting thus far. That is why I think he should aim for Mata's current role as his easiest route into the team currently. Especially if Mata can prove he is the man for that 2nd striker/10 role LVG envisages for the tip of the diamond instead of Januzaj or Memphis.

515~~~
Try telling that to our manager.

Everyone can see it, except him. Surprise, surprise.

516~~~
I sure hope we don't do a De Gea with this lad.

517~~~
What? Put him goal?

518~~~
and they say VG was the reason for why Barcelona started their dynasty, yet he does not like creativity from the centre. Doubt Xavi and iniesta is his cup of tea

519~~~
I'd like to see Herrera given a run of games out on the right, with Mata brought in as the #10.

520~~~
Hasn't had a great half. Lacking match rhythm quite clearly. Have to say that Januzaj hasn't seemed to helped him out with an option much to me.

521~~~
Ordinary so far. Almost a headless chicken chasing the ball at times positionally.

Gonna also get sent off at the rate he is going.

522~~~
A very poor half. But I'm not surprised.

523~~~
Looks rusty tbh, game time will do him good.

524~~~
Well of the pace and on a yellow too.

525~~~
He looks like a walking red card. He needs to come off sadly.

526~~~
Starting at 10 for the second half. Interesting to see how deep/advanced he plays...

527~~~
Let's see what he can do in a more advanced position now

528~~~
That pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Could have shot, but got Wayne another goal. Perfect.

529~~~
There's our No. 10 folks. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

530~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

531~~~
Not had the best of games, but hopefully the assist will provide him with a confidence boost.

532~~~
That was quick

533~~~
As I said ....

534~~~
Looked pretty poor in the first half. Not a surprise since the role didn't suit him. Looks miles better already in a proper role!

535~~~
He runs beyond the strikers. Where as Januzaj stands still.

536~~~
Great run, great pass.

537~~~
Great awareness! Lovely goal overall.

538~~~
Boom!

539~~~
Already much better with a bit more freedom!

540~~~
I really hope he becomes the permanent #10. He definitely has the ability to do it.

541~~~
What a 10 mins!  3 big chances created - 1 assist.

542~~~
Needs to start as 10. Way better than Januzaj

543~~~
1 assist and 1 very good, opening pass. You can see that's his best position

544~~~
That's more like it! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

545~~~
Two Schs as 6 and 8 and Herrera as 10 will be great midfield.

546~~~
He did. Great in the second half though. Almost as good as Rooney!

547~~~
Sooooo much better then Januzaj.

Its not even close.

548~~~
Lol, I feared he would be taken off. Good for his confidence he stayed on. 

Looking much better further up the pitch.

549~~~
Yeah thank god. I definitely prefer him to Januzaj!

550~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Classic redcafe.

551~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Ander! Nice finish.

552~~~
So twice he runs off the striker resulted in assist and goal.

553~~~
So cool. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

554~~~
Intelligence and passing is much better. Let's hope he's our AM now.

555~~~
There we go <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

So much better as a #10

556~~~
So after a poor first half he's been amazing this half <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Start him in the next game up there please

557~~~
Can be very pleased with his 2nd half contribution. Wasn't overly convinced in the 1st half but he's definitely earned himself a more regular place in our team with his assist and goal. Definitely better in a more advanced role, as others are saying.

558~~~
Rough first half but ended with a goal and an assist, should start over Januzaj this weekend.

559~~~
What a farce Janazaj started in the position that Herrera just owns like a boss

560~~~
Great recovery after horribly shit first half, was worried he burried his chances for a loooong time but he'll be back into the mix I guess. I doubt we'll switch to 433 where he excels in though.

561~~~
I think he'd do a lot better in CM if he was paired with Schneiderlin than Carrick, as Schneiderlin would cover for him more and there would be less need for Herrera to into so many tackles. 

That said, he should clearly start at 10 for now.

562~~~
He should be rotating with Fellaini for that #10 spot. Not only can he influence attacks, he can link up play between midfield and forwards.

563~~~
Showed today that he is not one for the holding roles but in a more offensive role he can really excel hopefully he gets to start in the n10 role on Sunday.

564~~~
I just knew he'd do really well in the second half and score... delighted for the bloke. He's a much better option in there then Adnan in my opinion.

565~~~
Started off shabbily no doubt but he brings something we don't to have anywhere else. Also seems to be quite vocal and demonstrative which is nice to see.

566~~~
A bit more advanced he's just a different player. Happy that he made up to a poor first half

567~~~
Yup, he should start vs Swansea in the same position he played in the 2nd half today.

568~~~
Great second half. I love his striking technique, he almost always caresses the ball into the net.

569~~~
He shouldn't be played in a holding role in a 4-2-3-1 unless there is an injury crisis. Either play him in a 4-3-3 as last season or as #10 as second half today.

570~~~
should play in the advanced role of a midfield 3. We play much better with him in the team.

571~~~
Him and Schmidfield is the way to go but we will see that in December/January with the title all but gone. Was very poor in the first half but recovered well in the second.

572~~~
OK he looked rusty first half but showed what he is all about second half and brought proper balance to our attack. More please.

Looks like our best option on the right to me. Mata in the middle.

573~~~
Glad for him. Fantastic player to watch,many makes our team click when he's playing as a 10

574~~~
He pleasantly surprised me as a 10. I dare say he was taken off to protect him for the weekend.

575~~~
Might have snatched the MOM if he had stayed on but his sloppy first half worked against him.

Clearly not comfortable in the deeper role where he looked a little lost as to what he was supposed to do. A completely different player once he was given the freedom to drift and the openness of the game really suited his aggressive passing.

Linked play infinitely better than Januzaj, held the ball well and made good runs beyond the striker. I like Adnan but if Herrera shows the same form in future games then he really should be starting there for the rest of the season.

576~~~

577~~~
Had a nightmare first half but improved in the second. Wouldn't read too much into it either way.

578~~~
Really smart man management from Louis tonight I thought. Most people - myself included - would've taken him off after that first half, even though it could've destroyed his confidence. The switch to accomodate him might not have been left field genius or anything, but it still wasn't the obvious one. LVG's been good with his subs this season, but largely 'cos they've been more straightforward than some of the "outside the box" gems of last term. This was a proper managerial move, that worked. Not just in team terms, but in transforming a nervy, out of favour player's form and confidence instantly.

579~~~
As the analysis said he was poor first half but once he got more forward in the second half he was much better, nice finish for his goal too

580~~~
Was absolutely awful in the first half.  Repeatedly gave the ball away, made passes to nowhere and was out of pace with a fairly slow match.  Full credit to him though that he came back in the second half and got his chance to play higher up the pitch and did well.  He clearly lacks full match fitness, but I think he can be more influential in there than Adnan is looking right now.

581~~~
It was like watching a different player in the second half, he was shocking in the first half.

582~~~
That's my boy!

583~~~
I've been thinking about moving Mata central, I'd think perhaps we'd score more goals.

However Mata, like Memphis, isn't a midfielder and can struggle to link defense and attack.

Herrera likely won't score as much as Mata as a no.10, trequartista, but I think the team will be better off.

As I've said too many times, he's the only player we have that has shown he can consistently link defense to attack.

Herrera also supports the midfield better in defense, as well as speeding up play with his quick decision making.

584~~~
Herrera's a good n.10? Shocking, not..  

He's best position at Bilbao was as their #10

585~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/manchester-united/story/2583526/ander-herrera-performance-pleased-united-boss-louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/manchester-uni...erformance-pleased-united-boss-louis-van-gaal</a>

"He started not so good," said Van Gaal.

"He had a lot of ball losses and also a yellow card, so at that moment I wanted to change him, but then I saw he was coming back.

"And after that moment he plays a good match on the 'double six' position, but later on at 10 he was better. So I'm very pleased also for him."

Glad LVG first didn't pull him and then saw that he improved and did best in the position he excels in the most anyway.

586~~~
I'm not sure if it was this thread or another but I mistakenly said 'Herrera would work good with any of the other 3 (Carrick, Schmidfield)'. Maybe I was wrong but Herrera's natural instinct is to press and chase the ball. This works well when you do that as a team and if your partners are on the same wavelength. Obviously any of them 4 would work better as a 3 but in a 2, for Herrera it'd work a lot better with Schmidfield than with Carrick. It's a clash of styles. Schmidfield are more like minded with their forward thinking passing and constant pass and move. Carrick is like that too but more content to hold position.

Anyways glad we saw Herrera finish strongly, let's hope he starts against Swansea (even if it means dropping Januzaj, our golden boy).

587~~~
Was over eager and sloppy for most of the first half and was the main reason our defense had players run free at it, but he steadied and then excelled when moved to the AM/#10 role, surely did enough to start vs Swansea.

588~~~
Think we should definitely start him @ 10 against Swansea. He is a goal threat with his runs and has good technique vision and passing to play as a 10. But maybe he is not fast enough for lvg. I think he makes up for it with his other skills though

589~~~
We didn't need to defend as much in this game. That's why he was played I think. Back to Carrick/Schneidy/Schweiny in midfield against Swansea then. Having said that, if Januzaj is dropped, Ander Herrera will play instead.

590~~~
Absolutely, without doubt the best '10' at the club. No surprises here. Get in an upgrade at right wing and keep him in that position.

Not even based off last night. It's just obvious he's the best option for that role.

591~~~
I was confused when I saw he was playing in the deeper CM role with Carrick...especially in an away CL match. It just isn't his role at all. Definitely was the best no. 10 on the pitch and should be played in that role.

592~~~
What a performance as a 10, not quite a suprise since most of us keep raging about having him ahead of Schmidfiled for quite some time. At half time I think I even said that.

Amazingly good 2nd half, he even made Rooney seems like his old self. 

Herrera as 10 or Van Gaal out!

<span style="color: #ffffff">hahahahaha</span>

593~~~
This case study clearly shows why 3rd midfielder > 2nd striker.

594~~~
Yup, he let him start the 2nd half and Herrera proved himself. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

595~~~
I was thinking the exact same thing. He had a horrendous opening spell, ending up in that booking. I was sure Van Gaal was going to hook him at half-time, which would have been devastating for the poor lad. He really upped his game after that poor start, though. Which is credit to his mental toughness. You could tell the goal meant the world to him. Such a likeable player.

596~~~
As I only saw the highlights, so I can't really speak to Ander's performance last night. It sounds as though he was awful in the first half, but a goal and an assist on his return to the starting XI looks a solid return to me.

I'm surprised that Herrera was so effective at 10. Personally, I think he's more of an eight. Still, as the Van Gaal quote from <a class="username" data-user="47413, @Shimo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47413/">@Shimo</a> shows, we're playing two sixes and one 10, so there's no number eight position for him to play. If Herrera is going to get back into the team its gonna be in the Litmanen/Muller role. With the way Herrera's goalscoring has (surprisingly) blossomed since he joined United, who is to say he can't make that role his own?

597~~~
There is no reason why he shouldn't be able to play the position he started with. It wasn't exactly a holding role. It's more of a box to box role. All he have to do is support Carrick in defensive situations and support Januzaj in offensive, at the same time show up for passes from Memphis and Mata. Like LVG said, he's a controlling midfielder, he can keep things flowing with ease but he messed up with first half from giving the ball away cheaply and unnecessary tackle.

That said, I fully agree he's better off upfront.

598~~~
He wasn't awful for the whole of the first half tbf. Just the first 20-30 minutes.

599~~~
He looked a little rusty and perhaps too over eager to me in the first 20 mins or so, really wanted to get in brugges face and give them no space. Slipped for the yellow card which was unlucky, but after half time he really drove us forward. Some of his passing is great and he's always on the move, you can definitely see the intelligence he has. 

His unselfishness to give Rooney his 2nd is also very good to see, and so glad he got a goal himself. 

He should start at the 10 against Swansea.

600~~~
LVG seems to want to play with 2 6's and one 10 who is basically a support striker far forward. Not sure where Herrera will fit in here. He is best at #8 with license to go forward in a sort of role Toure plays for City but that doesn't seem to exist in this LVG system.

601~~~
What I like about him is how he doesn't ponder much. It's something very clearly been drilled into him from the Bilbao days with their quick and short one two touch passing exchanges. That's why I feel he adds a. Different dimension to us in terms of linking up play. The pass for Rooney's second being a first time one was what made the delivery just perfect.

602~~~
None of the No.10 strikers have worked though, I think he could be fighting with Fellaini for that spot. Then there will be game its suits Ander and games it suits Fellaini. Adnan isn't up to it at the moment. I am sure Wayne appreciated the short time Ander played there. Him, Mata and Memphis will provide goals galore for him.

603~~~
He looked absolutely stoked to get that goal. Love his attitude.

604~~~
At number 10 he can be instinctive, which is risky further back in midfield. A lot of his passes are first time ones. Moving him upfield definitely gets the best out of him, not just assists but he can chip in with goals. The pass for Rooney and the finish from the superb Bastian pass were sublime.

605~~~
The first half mistakes seemed to be out of really trying a bit too hard to impress, and failing. He probably kenw he needed a second half performance given the competition.

606~~~
I love his movement after his first touch. Always seems to be able to get away from his marker and start an attack. Would like to see him as our starting #10.

607~~~
True. I don't think he likes having loads of time on the ball. He's not like carrick in that regard who likes peace and time to do his stuff. Herrera plays with less calculation and more drive. 

It's a strange one because I don't consider him good with his back to goal, and earlier said that number 10 is the wrong role for him, but I suppose it depends on how far forward he picks up the ball. Yesterday was perfect. A few league games he came on he seemed too advanced.

608~~~
The first half proved he shouldn't play in a midfield 2, he was dreadful. The second half showed the complete opposite great runs behind the opo defence something we miss a lot from our midfielders. He should take Januzaj's place and continue to play in a midfield 3.

609~~~
Terrible first half, and I'm so glad the boss left him on instead of hooking him, especially after the booking. We probably wouldn't have seen him again for a little while if that happened, as he did himself no favours.

Second-half in a 3 - he was very good. I really, really want Adnan to capre diem in his role, but Herrera is currently the best option I must concede. That is the issue with the big clubs. I'm certain that if we continue to invest games in Adnan, the reward would be massive. At this level, that won't happen. I also think Andreas earned a shot in that role too in pre-season, and he is perhaps more natural there than Adnan.

610~~~
I wouldn't read too much into the midfield performance. He was poor, but mainly at the passing side of the game. That's usually a strength of his, so I'm willing to chalk it up to rustiness.

When it came to movement and making himself available for a pass, I thought he was terrific. He actually did the hard parts of being a midfielder well and messed up the easy parts. Once he gets a few games under his belt, I'd be happy to try him out a little deeper again.

I think it's a bit reactionary to want to put him in at #10 based on yesterday.

611~~~
Mata will become a considerably more effective player with Herrera on the pitch. This should not be forgotten. These 2 really enjoy playing together and are always on the same wavelength. He should be starting every game. It genuinely makes my blood boil when he is not in the team

612~~~
I also think that if the attack is stagnant, then he is a great option to change the formation and get the attack going, not putting Fellaini on and pump the ball up. Try something a bit more subtle for a change. LvG may put Fellaini in to start and then he now knows he can change the formation about. It is no good if you stick to the same formation or you soon get found out.

613~~~
I just love the guy

614~~~
Herrera and Mata are the best 10s at the club. At least Herrera might begin starting there now.

How long until LVG realises Januzai should be starting out wide. Hopefully he'll "try" that to accommodate them both in the team at some point.

615~~~
Nightmare of a first half .But that could be down to rustiness and being played out of his comfort zone. Second half was much better playing in a more forward position.

616~~~
Yep. Looked very poor/rusty in the first half. Great second half. Would love to see him at the point of a midfield three with Schneiderlin and one of Carrick/Schweinstiger behind him. I think that could be role for him. Not necessarily a number 10, but the most forward of a midfield three, especially in big away games.

617~~~
Yes fair play, it was a very good call. It's the first that springs to mind though. Poor subs vs. Newcastle for example.

618~~~
It seems every time he's asked a question by the manager he stands up to it and performs. Even after a stinker of a first half hour. 

He starts whenever its fit for me, just a valuable asset in the team. Can pass, tackle and get about the pitch with ease.

619~~~
I think his subs/tweaks at 60 minutes against Villa were very good. Really shut the game down. None of that nervous closing spell we had against Spurs.

620~~~
Also fair.

621~~~
Fellaini and Hernandez were good subs in the first leg, too.

622~~~
Yep, been impressed with Van Gaal's substitutions this season. In fact his selection in general has been pleasingly 'common sense'.

623~~~
The one really obvious "too clever for his own good" decision was Demphis at 10. Fair play to him for giving Januzaj a go instead. A pity it's not been fully vindicated yet and perhaps it's time to give Ander a crack.

624~~~
Dunno. I agree with you that he actually showed a lot of promise in the midfield role - everyone calling it a total disaster is a bit knee-jerk. His tackling and passing were both well off what they normally are, but that movement, tempo and always being available for a pass were all noticeably there. The problems looked like rust and nerves more than being ill-suited to the position.

That said, he was excellent in the second half, so I think we have to consider that the role for him at the moment and keep the option of trying him a little deeper again for when he's settled back into the side.

625~~~
Yep. Januzaj really worked there for a couple of games, for me, so there was nothing wrong with that, but Herrera seems like the right choice for Swansea.

626~~~
Van Gaal looks set with the two sitting midfielders, usually two of Schweinsteiger, Carrick and Schneiderlin. I don't think Herrera is suited to the way he wants those two sitting midfielders to play, but he could be great as the #10 in this formation, as we saw in the 2nd half.

His natural instincts as a footballer seem to be that he always wants to be involved, and to be where the ball is, so as a #10, he will probably perform like a hybrid of a #8 and a #10, dropping deep, bringing the ball forward and getting into the box. He will link the sitting midfielders to the attack, which is something that has been lacking so far. There's often a huge gap between the front and the back, and nobody to fill it.

Januzaj can make things happen with the ball, but he's not the man to link it all together. Not yet anyway. Herrera and Mata are much more suited to that, and with Herrera's tenacity off the ball as well, I think he should be given a run in that position.

 
Solid.

627~~~
Some players look better in different shapes of that midfield 3 formation.For example Carrick looks better if he plays as single protector of back 4,Ander at the moment looks like he can play only as one of CMs in midfield 3 with point back,or as number 10.

628~~~
Bugger.

Yeah, yeah, but APART FROM THAT, what has LVG ever done for us?

629~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-herrera-van-gaal-9940576" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ws/manchester-united-herrera-van-gaal-9940576</a>

How did author conclude LVG wanted to sub him after 13 minutes?

630~~~
He didn't say anything of the sort, he inferred that he would sub him, not stating when exactly but saw he was improving towards the end of the half. That's headline writers for you.

631~~~
Whether it's true or not, I could see why LVG might have wanted to. He was too aggressive off the ball, fouling them needlessly and received an early yellow card in the 13th minute. The worry of going down to 10 men.

Herrera definitely became a lot less hyper afterwards fortunately. Probably received an instruction to calm the feck down.

Edit: Oh and LVG saying he played well at the "DOUBLE 6 POSITION" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What the feck is that.

632~~~
Exactly. Journalism, what a terrific job.

633~~~
Interesting that LVG acknowledges it as doubles 6's. Normally want a 6 and an 8.

634~~~

635~~~
Think it's cause he got booked after 13 minutes probably and Van Gaal said he was "thinking of changing him then", as in when he got booked but I think Van Gaal was more thinking like thinking of subbing him off at half time, rather then wanting to take him off after 13 minutes.

636~~~
I like to hear all these positive noises from the players who aren't currently in favour. Fellaini, Young, Herrera and even Mata/Blind. Bin Hernandez for another forward so he can't post his cryptic instagram bollocks and we'll be grand.

637~~~
Herrera will flourish at the no. 10. Overall, he didn't have a great game last night, but in the second half, he showed what he is capable of. Better option than Januzaj, that's for sure.

638~~~
Agreed. He looked very good as the right CM in a 433 with Mata as the RW. Those two seem to have a very good understanding.

639~~~
The game against Bruges was totally unrepresentative of the way our season will go. We won't face many weaker sides this season, for one thing.

Herrera looked good because Bruges were all over the place and he had space to run into. Januzaj is van Gaal's first pick because he's much more likely to beat a man. The two players take to the role very differently. Against PL opposition, I can see why LvG opts for Adnan, since the space that Herrera thrives in is far more difficult to find.

Herrera's problem is that he's not really a #10 so it'll be difficult for him to be the creative fulcrum in tight games. I think he'd look better as one of two #8s in a 4-3-3, but we don't really have any other #8s to pair him with. 

This could be a frustrating season for him, I reckon. His best hope is that we buy another box-to-box midfielder to replace Carrick at some point.

640~~~
I love the way people seem to have forgotten how well he played in some of the big games last season. He had no trouble finding space then in fact he left a few vaunted PL players literally on their arses.

641~~~
Yea but Janazaj could not find the space even against Brugges last night, he was awful even against them. Which does ask the problem, why keep with a player who does not know the no10 role? at bilbao that was herrera's best position. So while they were awful, so was janazaj in the position he's been asked to play. When herrera was changed, he already improved us. let us not forget how he played city off the park last season, when we look at their record against us since 2011

642~~~
When paired with Fellaini who was double/triple marked.

643~~~
Herrera is smart enough to find space against any side and has the ability to beat a man as we've seen plenty of times and none more so joyfully than we he took on the whole of Arsenal's much revered midfield. He had a stop-start season last year yet was arguably our best outfield player imo so I think he more than deserves to be given a good run of games and a proper chance to prove himself in that role. His vision and craft are his best attributes and far superior to Januzaj's, I honestly believe Januzaj should be given a chance in Mata's position as he is more likely to attempt a take-on and cross rather than cut back inside and pass it sideways or backwards which Mata always seem to do.

644~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Okay, here goes: he got us back into Europe.

645~~~
Januzaj hogs the ball too much to be effective in the PL until he finds that balance (knowing exactly when to release the ball, when to drop deep etc) he will always be inconsistent. Herrera, on the other hand, knows the role and has played it for Bilbao against the likes of Barca. His dribbling is of a high standard, can score and playing him closer to goal brings his through balls into play plus he can press which would aid us defensively whilst also allowing us to win balls high up the pitch which is always a sure way to create goal scoring opportunities.

646~~~
Not to quote Dante's post, he'll have enough alerts as it is. Strange post, his best position at Bilbao was at nr. 10. He can play that position very good and better than Adnan who got his chance but hasnt proved his worth there. 
At nr. 10 beating the man is not the only thing which is important, at that position you need to get the play going and pick passes for forwards at the right time. With Mata on the right Herrera could do his job perfectly. And with Memphis on the left and Rooney playing like he played yesterday. 

Also don't understand why is his best hope we buy another box to box mid.

647~~~
Wow some of you guys have to read this article, it's nothing new but the comments he makes are exactly why we fecking love him at Utd.

Two bits to highlight for me

Herrera like Schneiderlin, Blind, Bastian, Mata, Depay, Fellani and even Valencia will always offer the pass when others have the ball ALL the time even when they are both under pressure i.e at times when it really matters.

There's a difference for me when compared to others like Carrick, Rooney and Young, as the option is at a far less frequency and they offer much less ability to actually diffuse the situation/press.

That's the subtle but important part between a hoof/clearance/rushed pass to a potentially crucial transition. When you escape a moment of press, you have the player/s pressing on their back foot, whilst you've moved forward/into space on your front foot. This is basically half a yard gained and the whole team can advance. That's more space for a through ball, for a drive etc; it opens up opportunities even in tight games against deep defences. 

That's the textual analysis of it because we all realise and can see it when we're watching games but you don't actually think why/how.

Herrera's close control, technique, mobility, tenacity and athleticim is why he's a brilliant player for us to build upon on.


This next bit is self explanatory really because we all know, he <b>actually</b> means it and is not media talk.

648~~~
No shit, that's what he played at Athletic.

649~~~
what the feck is a theoretical scheme <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . Everyone and his dog knows herrera is a boss in the free role. Van Gaal acting like he figured this out of thin air <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

650~~~
Hopefully he gets his chance Sunday now that Januzaj is out.

A Carrick/Schweinsteiger - Schneiderlin - Herrera midfield would give any team problems.

651~~~
Luckily LVG finally got his senses and realized what all the managers behind their screens already now.

652~~~
So what do we reckon, is he starting today? 
I've put him in my lineup prediction. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

653~~~
With Januzaj injured and Fellaini lacking match rhythm I think we will finally see him starting in the n10 role.

654~~~
He hasn't dazzled exactly but he did create decent chances for Mata and Rooney.

655~~~
Starved of the ball. Our players refuse to play the risky pass that could release him or allow him to create in dangerous areas.

656~~~
He barely touched the ball but he did set up two pretty much clear goalscoring chances.

657~~~
We've not managed to work any clear chances after Herrera went off. He barely touched the ball and still managed to open them up three or four times.

Van Gaal's response? Sub him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

658~~~
If he gets the ball, he'll do something imaginative and creative with it. One of our best players today even though he was starved of possession.

659~~~
Was looking the most creative of the front four, of course he gets subbed. 

Really annoyed by the constant two deep CMs we are playing now, even when we are trailing. Take some risk ffs.

660~~~
Opens up opposing team. Gets subbed because manager gives up on playing football.

661~~~
Anonymous

662~~~
Yep. Just was our most creative player.

663~~~
He created our 3 best chances, the movement around him is mediocre at best.

664~~~
Absolutely bizarre. Set up Mata in the first two minutes with a great chance, set up Rooney one-on-one at 0-0, put Mata through on goal at 1-0...he played well.

665~~~
Did well I thought. Pressed well, and created chances. Would have had a few assists if Rooney didn't mess up his chances

666~~~
At Least two posts saying 'starved of the ball'. Why was he starved of the ball?

667~~~
Herrera is not the problem, it is the tactic and team itself. Depay and Januzaj played shite too there, without seeing any balls. Same with Herrera, although he did look quite better than them.

668~~~
When will he have the courage to haul Rooney off, Bastian, who looked terrible the whole game and Depay who looks like he is going to struggle playing two games in a week. He got the subs completely wrong. Hoofing the ball to Fellaini, is that admitting that is all he is good for?

669~~~
This. 

As soon as Herrera went off I knew we'd lost. The midfield, predictably, ceased to do anything. We just went out right and pumped in crosses to Swansea defenders' foreheads.

670~~~
I forgot he was on to be honest. Though to be fair he and Rooney were barely passed to so i suppose it's not a surprise.

671~~~
As soon as I knew he was coming off, we'd create nothing more.

672~~~
He wasn't the answer we were hoping for, similar performance to the ones Januzaj had when he started played some nice passes but mostly he was very anonymous.

673~~~
To be fair we didn't create too much when he was on either.

Once Fellanini came on everything started getting pumped up to him, it can be effective but i don't like it personally.

674~~~
Felt he didn't impose himself on the game as well as he generally does - touch and move, raising our temp etc, but tbf the whole team (except Shaw you could say) didn't look great. He did create a few excellent chances though.

675~~~
Herrera had a good game and did a better job off Rooney then anyone else this season for us.

The problem in attack was around him. I just don't see an obvious plan and it feels very rigid. We need much more movement, especially as he showed he'll find the passes.

We were let down for that second goal tbf which really changed the game. Romero should have saved it easily and at 1-1 the game could have finished very differently.

We've got issues in the team but Herrera isn't one of them imo.

676~~~
I don't see anyone excelling in that role with our current setup.  I love Mata, but having him on the left without a fullback like Dani Alves bombing forward providing width is hamstringing our attack.  With only one position providing significant threat in behind the defense and little width our #10 will always end up strangled in possession.  Ander is good in tight spaces and Adnan is a good dribbler, but no one is good enough to consistently perform with those limitations around them.

677~~~
Then change the system. Him and his bloody rigid system. He is putting all the blame on the players in post match. He is cramming too much stuff into them. Just make the game bloody simple.

678~~~
He will be the scapegoat.

679~~~
Expected too much from him today, he was decent but personally I didn't think he was a massive improvement on what Januzaj has offered in recent weeks. Much tougher game though to be fair.

680~~~
Indeed he will. I particularly dislike the people who will now say that having him central won't work as we tend to get when issues outside of the players control are randomly used against him.

681~~~
Give any manager in the league 250m, and they`d do that no problem.....

682~~~
Had a good game. Good movement, passing and work rate. With Gomis instead of rooney upfront and he has a couple of assists.

683~~~
Played well, created all our best chances aside from the goal, and is subbed off <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

684~~~
He sees the passes better than everyone in the team, Needs a run at that position.

685~~~
Played well with what he received from him team mates. 

Things he should do better/can improve on realistically:

Be more of a threat and impose himself on the game. There was a few times he was outside their box, where he could have possible drove into the penalty area and added a bit of urgency with a 1-2 or make space for a shot for himself. 
The first half, he barely saw the ball and he should have probably dropped deeper to try to find it a bit more. Maybe it was manager instructions and the tactics but I felt the game definitely bypassed him for long periods.

686~~~
Agree completely.  Think he plays best when Carrick starts though.

687~~~
Nail on head. £250m is a ludicrous amount of money, just fecking imagine if you pumped that 250m into Swansea instead... They would undoubtedly be in 4th

688~~~
Quite possible but we had Morgan and Basti occupying the spaces there. It was right of LVG to start with a midfield 3 today but our lack of a true winger on the right and a pacy striker undid us.

689~~~
Thought he was decent. His energy is useful, always hungry for the ball, and he's the only one who doesn't slow play down too much in their half.

690~~~
Yeah but at times, Herrera was very close to Rooney and because we weren't willing to pass to him in those tight spaces (as Swansea was closing space well), Bastian and Morgan had no one in front to pass to consistently.

Saw this posted up in the Mata thread, if we're able to pass to Herrera's feet ALL the time then he will do something but we're afraid of getting knicked and countered. To combat this Herrera has to drop deeper. I don't envy Januzaj, Depay and Herrera playing that 10 role with the way we play football. They've been told to stay close to Rooney and stay high up the pitch but the only way for them to be effective is literally sprint into spaces and run around like a man possessed before any of them get any possession of worth.

691~~~
He's trying but not much coming off for him so far.

692~~~
Poor first half just like the other offensive players.

693~~~
Really disappointed with him so far. Maybe he's a slow starter like Carrick, but he should be playing much better.

694~~~
Every time he gets the ball he just passes sidewards.

695~~~
Didn't really offer a lot in the first half.

696~~~
He's been invisible alongwith Mata. With Mata it happens often, with Herrera it's surprising. TBH whenever Carrick or Schweinsteiger get the ball, Lucas/Milner try to cut off the passing angles to him quickly.

697~~~
He is not a 10 for me, simple as that. Needs to play in a midfield 3 as a box to box CM with the freedom to play passes and to dribble around. The way we play and he plays, with the backpasses, he can stay on the bench.

698~~~
He's olaying too high up the pitch.

699~~~
He's generally better in a more advanced role than in a deeper one, though.

700~~~
Agree with that. He's not having a great game today.

701~~~
Keepers don't save those. Outstanding penalty.

702~~~
I love you Ander!

703~~~
He's best in a three man midfield as one of two attacking mids, with a single holder in behind, where he can play a fairly free role.

704~~~
That's how you take a penalty. Not even Stretch Armstrong is getting near that.

705~~~
A little pussy when Benteke scored. Not happy about that.

706~~~
Perfect penalty but had a mixed game. Needs to pick up from otherwise I can see LVG benching him soon. Got better in the 2nd half though

707~~~
Just saw that

Shame, but yeah he pussied out of that

708~~~
Improved in the second half. I give him 6/6.5. Did some things well, some errors with his passing in the first half.

709~~~
He's a bit too tidy sometimes, Van Gaal really made him to play like this, he's much more creative and we would have used him better giving him more freedom but still great player you must love...

710~~~
Did better in the second half, disssapointed that he chickened out of the Benteke goal, could have stopped the goal and won a free kick.

711~~~
He was far better than Mata for me, who was just a non factor and so very disappointing.

Herrera had his moments today. Great work to win the penalty, and then composure to put it away. At the same time, he needs to be calmer sometimes, and can't always be in such a hurry.

712~~~
Even an all time GOAT number 10 would have struggled to find space today, they basically were set up to do nothing other than deny us space on the edge of their box. 

Disappointing game, but obvious mitigating factors.

713~~~
I agree. Too often he went for the safe option even though he could have played forward. Hope LVG gives more freedom to our players. Herrera is at his best when he has runners around him who play quick football. He is very good at then finding them and opening up play. He's sharp and intelligent and I hope LVG finds a way to get that out of him. In a match like today he doesn't show that

714~~~
Disagree with that. At times when United look like creating absolutely zero he is the only one who will keep trying and trying to work an opening. We have Memphis who will resort to trying shots from range, but Ander will try and get the team passing.

And then when it needs toning down he's fantastic at it. His movement and passing is phenomenal, as seen in the final moments of the game where he was passing it around the Liverpool players with Schneiderlin.

715~~~
Some are very harsh on here. Was one of our brighter spots in the first half and did very well in the second imo. Could have done better for Benteke's goal but still! Great penalty as well.

716~~~
Strangely looked better when he moved to the right, ofcourse he also got to play against a charity left back in Moreno.

717~~~
I don't disagree with upping the tempo. But there has to be control to it. For example he won the ball today along the touchline, and played this bizarre cross field pass possibly with his left foot (?) which gave the ball away. I love adventurous football but it can't lead to things like Wayne Rooney's touch which gave possesion away against Swansea. In general I prefer Herrera's style of play but it's about having a balance.

718~~~
Out of curiosity, what did you expect him to do? Get a kick in the face?

719~~~
So is he now our main penalty taker since he didn't miss?

720~~~
Well yes of course

721~~~
I love it when people watching a game are quite happy for somebody to get their faces kicked in. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

722~~~
Love Ander, still not sure he'll ever settle under Louis. I'd still like to see him alongside Schneiderlin against a lesser side maybe.

723~~~
100% record. That took some guts in such a big game.

724~~~
Our best #10, watch him get dropped for Rooney as Martial takes #9.

725~~~
Sorry but that's part of the game

Many players would have put their heads in there

Apart from that Herrera and a decent game but that was a little disappointing

726~~~
I don't see how thats strange?

He struggled because Liverpool's entire game plan was denying space in the middle in front of their box, he then moved out of their and looked quite bright.

727~~~
I think Mata is, but he wasnt on the pitch.

728~~~
Likely the same sort who headbutt walls and put their fists through windows.

729~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No, I don't want to be too harsh cos I really like Herrera and want him to start, but most mangers will fecking kill him for ducking out of that and I expect Lvg to give him a right ear full

730~~~
Can't decide whether I blame him for that Benteke goal or not. He definitely would've won a free kick if he got his head in there but wanting someone to get a boot in side of the head just to stop a goal in a football match almost feels sadistic. It could genuinely cause a serious injury.

731~~~
Was awful except for the goal and I was livid he didn't challenge Benteke at all for the goal, but watching the replays it's clear that he could have done nothing about it.

732~~~
Completely agree. That said, I love the little bugger.

733~~~
They are probably both better penalty takers than Wayne.

734~~~
This. Anyone with a brain would avoid that. Phil Jones, on the other hand...

735~~~
Phil's head would have ended up in Row Z and he would still be running about.

736~~~
His head would still manage to maintain one of it's infamous scary faces.

737~~~
'Blood and guts' football is great, makes for fabulous narrative, but there's a fine line between commitment and mental behavior, and players are responsible for their own safety. If Ander didn't think butting into Benteke's foot was a great idea, fine by me. Rather concede a goal, than have a player suffer concussion, or worse get sidelined for a while. That does the club and manager no good, and injuries to the head are no joke.

738~~~
Played with energy and did well for the penalty, overall not a great game from him but it's difficult to play as a #10 when Mata and Fellaini are 2 of your 3 options as runners, since neither have any pace to get in behind.

739~~~
could have tried to block that that's true but I can tell from my experience playing beach football for a couple of years that you don't really want to get too close... seen an ambulance coming  for inexperienced player who tried to block a scissor kick and got his jawbone broken with a lot of blood around. And Benteke is a different beast with his boots on. That was as powerful kick as it gets

740~~~
Ya, I posted that at HT when neither had done anything. Herrera improved slightly, and the penalty was fantastic.

741~~~
Criticising him for ducking is massively harsh, in my opinion, Benteke is a big fecker and you're basically asking Herrera to put his head in the way of his boot at full force. That'd cause serious damage. 

It does raise the question of dangerous play though, bicycle kicks are always a bit dodgy in that regard, but I'd hate to see them banned.

742~~~
He was nothing special today bar a very clever bit of play to win the penalty. I am finding it very difficult to see advantages of playing him as number 10 esp in matches where opponent seem happy to stay deep and close the space between midfielders and defense. I was a big fan of his showing as a box to box player on right last season, but as a number 10 he seems to be a little limited. May be he needs more game time at that position to prove himself also considering since he's not really a DM, it'd be difficult to see him compete for any places bar number 10.

743~~~

744~~~
It makes it look like he's standing still, but he was actually moving towards Benteke and turning away. Vidic and Jones probably wouldn't have done that, but Herrera was too far away from Benteke to make much of a difference. At least that's how it looked to me.

745~~~
Played out right at the end. Wonder if he'll get any more time there, maybe with Martial and Rooney as the front 2, or even swapping with Mata?

746~~~
Herrera after the game: "When you come to Manchester United, the first thing you think of is scoring against Liverpool at Old Trafford."

This guy

747~~~
It was hilarious tbh but I know one thing, I would do the same thing. No way am I getting in the way of that.

748~~~
No way you could do Benteke for dangerous play, agreed. The Jerome? goal the other week that was chalked off was a disgrace. Everyone loves a bicycle kick and fair play, that goal was a belter today.

749~~~
I can excuse Herrera for not challenging for the cross. Kompany ducked Rooney's bicycle kick after all. Still, you might have expected him to try and put his body in the way of the strike like players do at free kicks. He could easily have jumped and turned his back as if charging down a strike. Yes, it could've wrong footed De Gea and deflected in anyway. If you're going to make that argument though you may as well scrap walls at set pieces.

I was really disappointed with the way Herrera got into good areas first half but played safe, rather than attempt a shot or a difficult pass. Yes, Van Gaal might have blown a gasket at him for conceding possession. Still, if you play at #10 for Man Utd you should be more scared of not scoring or creating goals than of being yelled at by the manager.

The great plus of having Herrera in the side is that he offers goals from midfield. Had Benteke's goal been an equaliser the momentum in the match would have totally changed. We needed the second goal to give us some breathing space, and Herrera delivered: bought the penalty and rifled it home. He deserves some credit for that, especially as that was his first penalty in a competitive fixture. Two goals from his last three starts at United is a solid return.

750~~~
Pft, knowing me I would have jumped and thrown an arm into Benteke or the ball and ended up copping the penalty. So I can't blame him too much but really he probably should have showed a bit more commitment

751~~~
Yep, I've never understood them. Unless a defender is well away, it should almost always count as a foul, but never does.

752~~~
His attacking and creative instincts seem to have been well and truly 'Van Gaal'd'.

753~~~
I dont blame him in the slightest for what was a freak, brilliant goal from Benteke. He showed glimpses of his class but he's obviously suffering from a fear of being dropped and was playing it safer than he usually does. LVG needs to reassure him his place is safe if we're to see what he can really do.

754~~~
Needs to get in the game more. Not offering much going ahead. He is just trying too hard to make those brilliant through balls that is not working for him. Should stick to basics. 

Great taken penalty thought. Unstoppable.

755~~~
Agree that if it was Vida not Ander, he would not probably have ducked, but all our defenders were much closer to our own goal, so at least Ander tried to close the space. I'd rather take one great goal from Benteke rather than have Herrera out with concussion for several weeks. If we have a bit more pacy winger than Mata and a bit more lively forward than Fellaini, Herrera would thrive. Also loved how he played those one twos in the last 10-15 seconds in the center of the park, pissing off Liverpool players <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

756~~~
Agreed with this. Also doesn't help when the only player willing to make run today was Mata who is going to find it very difficult to escape with Liverpool narrow defending. I like his energy though. His offer of making runs was the primary reason Carrick was able to play the pass and he was able to win the penalty. We need more players willing to make runs and sacrifice themselves for the team rather than playing final balls or taking players on and trying to scoring.

757~~~
Love the guy!

The new Ole in terms of the loving factor <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

As for the goal, unless you're brave like Vidic and Terry or someone who has no brain to process anything like Phil Jones, you are not getting your face/head in the way of Benteke's swinging leg.

758~~~
Spot on. We need more than one striker or one player making runs in the box. I think we are not putting enough pressure on the opposition defense when closer to their box. The more pressure we put the more chances of getting free kicks and penalties in the box, not to mention goal scoring opportunities. Also, our own goal needs to come out of hiding and have a stellar season

759~~~
According to an after game interview on the United website Herrera has never ever taken a penalty in a competitive game before. So even more well done Ander. 
<b>
Ander Herrera revealed after the game to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a> that his penalty in the 3-1 win over Liverpool was the first he has ever taken in a competitive match.</b>

The Spanish midfielder showed few nerves when hammering his spot-kick past Simon Mignolet to double Manchester United's lead after he was fouled by Joe Gomez inside the box. However, he was only on spot-kick duty because of Juan Mata's substitution and Wayne Rooney's injury so he was actually a novice in this area.

When asked if he had taken one before, he replied: "Never, never. But the manager last season gave me the confidence. He told me I had the quality to take penalties and I have practiced every week. And, today, when I received the penalty, I thought the number-one taker isn’t on the pitch, I’m the second taker so I’m happy for that. But, next time, if the number-one taker is on the pitch I won’t be taking it.

"I tried [put some force behind it] because I knew in advance that [Simon] Mignolet is a big keeper, very tall and very elastic. I tried to hit it as hard as possible and it was a good goal but the most important thing was the win."

Herrera was clearly delighted to experience another fabulous occasion at Old Trafford. 

"It’s not only a victory," he said. "It’s a very special day for us and our fans. When I arrived here, I realised what this game means for our fans. I have played three games against them and beat them in every game so I am very happy."

760~~~
Wasn't great but one think I do like about him is his urgency when he has the ball. He doesn't feck about when he has the ball. Wonder how he'd do on the right side of the midfield.

761~~~
I don't blame him for their goal. I don't blame him. Benteke is a tank. Took his penalty well. Once we get the balance right or the blend then Ander will find his best performances. He's better higher up the pitch with a quicker tempo but i'm glad for him to get the whole game. He's an intelligent guy and that's rare in football.

762~~~
Too often now he choses the safe option (that goes for many of our players) and that just can't bring the best out of him. I hope LVG finds a way to get that direct and quick play out of him where he can create a lot of urgency

763~~~
Great run that got us the pen, and a Sheareresque penalty to follow. Not a great match, but as some have pointed out, Liverpool was very compact around their box and he had very little space to work with. Should keep playing in that no 10 role imo

764~~~
I like the way he leathered that ball into the roof of the net, fantastic. He wasn't at his best in that #10 and won't be unless we have willing runners, with Mata & Fellaini it was not possible yesterday.

765~~~
I thought he was very good yesterday. Like another poster mentioned I don't like the way LVG has now trained him to think more negatively so he is looking to face backwards rather than squaring up his opponent and playing those brilliant through balls he's capable of. Overall tho I still think he's one of our best players and adds an energy and urgency that no one else brings to the side?

766~~~
Was anyone else absolutely terrified when he stepped up for the penalty? If he'd missed we could've easily thrown away the win. I was thinking it had to be Schweinsteiger and Herrera was way down the list.

767~~~
Yeh I love Herrera but I have to say I was thinking the exact same thing. I really thought it would be schweinsteiger with all his past experiences.

768~~~
I was afraid if he had  missed Van Gaal would have benched him again.

Anyway, Lampard -esque peno.

769~~~
I had a first thought that he should get his head there but two seconds later i said to myself 'i don't want our player to get his head there'.
There was such a power in the shoot it would be really stupid to try to stop it.

770~~~
Kinda. I remember thinking its a bit odd but then thinking, well he's confident enough to be step up and obviously good enough to be chosen so I'll trust him. Banging pen though.

771~~~
There is a clear hiearchcical order for penalties though. I think it is Mata, Herrera, Carrick....Once soemone misses, the next one takes penalties til he misses and so on. So i knew he would take it, but i hoped for Schweini at that moment. But philosophy is the philosophy.

772~~~
I posted an article from United website, Ander has never taken a penalty in a competitive game before. LvG said he was capable of taking penalties so he has been practicising them. If Mata was on the pitch he wouldn't of taken it and if he is on the pitch in future he won't be taking them either. He did well for his first in a game like this.

773~~~
I think Schweini is bit shit at penalties from what I remember from Bayern, or am I mistaking him for someone else?

774~~~
I don't think Schweini was ever the main penalty taker for Bayern, he missed his penalty in the 2012 CL final too. People just assume he's good at penalties because he's German <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

775~~~
10 goals in 36 appearances apparently.

Thought he was average yesterday, as always a lot of good - running into the box and neat exchanges but also a fair amount of wastefulness and I actually thought he was a bit more negative than usual, could be the Fellaini factor though.

776~~~
Yet it was Memphis and Mata the manager mentioned as being wasteful.

777~~~
Indeed, Memphis surely! Mata in that he wasted 90 minutes playing the ball backwards I suppose.

LvG also said we were better in first half so I really do wonder how we views football at united - though in fairness I fell asleep at around 25 mins due to the sheer lack of football being attempted by either team so maybe I missed it.

That was the most odd half of a United Liverpool game you're ever likely to see.

778~~~
Or however many minutes until he was subbed I should say.

779~~~
10 goals and 6 assists in 2,410 minutes at United. Goal/assist every 151 minutes, not a bad record at all.

Just for comparisons sake Mata has 17 goals and 12 assists in 4,215 minutes at United, which is a goal/assist ever 145 minutes.

780~~~
Both of these records are bloody brilliant. Ander's is probably better considering a bulk of it was played as a CM in a 433.

781~~~
We were better in the first half it was in the final 3rd we were awful. With Mata doing his usual nothing at right wing and slowing every attack that side and Depay having an off day.

782~~~
That was his first professional penalty!

783~~~
I couldn't believe that. We have the German captain on the pitch and we decide to go with someone who has never taken a penalty before! LVG is bizarre when it comes to allocating penalty takers.

784~~~
As someone else said, they don't think BFS is actually a good penalty taker. It's just because he is German we presume he is. Ander said LvG told him he would be a good penalty taker and gave him the confidence to try, this was last season. He said he practices them every week and this is the first chance, due to Mata going off, that he has been able to take one.

785~~~
Well taken penalty. To the roof of the net. Unsavable. We should be taking penalties this way.... out of the keeper's reach.

786~~~
My favourite kind of penalty, but they're so so risky. There's always a chance that you're going to sky it.

787~~~
Took some proper balls to take that penalty in the fashion he did. I specifically remember the split second it was in flight thinking he'd skied it. Emphatically rammed it in though.

788~~~
Love those sort of penalties.

Van Nistlerooy used to take them like that.

789~~~
I never doubted him he took the penalty. Last season he scored brilliant, precise goal. His shooting technique is top so I was sure he will hit it well

790~~~
His first penalty ever in a competitive game he says - it was brilliant. Apart from him shying away from the overhead kick (which tbf he was never reaching but he might have been able to block it with his face lol) he was good again.

791~~~
I was absolutely cacking it when he stepped up to take it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

When it was awarded my first thought was 'Shit, we don't have any penalty takers on the pitch', then presumed BFS or Carrick would step up and take it.

When it panned to Herrera holding the ball my heart did sink a bit. Top penalty though. Very reminiscent of Hargreaves vs Chelsea in the shootout. No keeper is saving those.

792~~~
Just watched the game and agree with this.  Everything he does on the ball is pretty tidy and he has great technique but he just seems so reluctant at times.  I feel it has to be LVG's influence or Herrera being worried about losing his place in the team.  Too many times he received the ball with the chance to drive at the Liverpool defense but he chose to turn back and play it safe.  Hopefully with a run of games we'll see him grow in confidence and he'll feel comfortable enough to play his natural game more.  Most of the time when he chooses to be more direct good things come from it and he definitely has the ability to play killer balls and be a goal threat.  Ditto for Mata too.

793~~~
You did see the penalty didn't you? Unsaveable, maybe LVG knew what he was doing.

794~~~
I was oddly confident that he would score it. Impressive considering it was his first one in a professional game.

795~~~
His shooting technique is excellent. Reminds of Yaya Toure a bit - both know how to lump the ball but almost all of their goals are side-footed caresses. 

His technique is actually surprisingly good, seeing how spare his goal contributions were at Bilbao.

796~~~
We need to start getting this guy in more goal scoring positions.

797~~~
Having watched the game again, a lot of the players were passing the ball sideways and backwards, including BFS. As LvG seemed to rate the first half performance then I presume it was instructions.

798~~~
Agreed, I'd also like to see him get into the box a lot more

799~~~
I worry if he rates the first half as good. We were impotent.

800~~~
indeed

801~~~
Still in of our 11 best players, even on a bad day.

802~~~
I would be putting him back at 10. Mata definitely isn't the answer there, or in a proper midfield three. He should never have been taken off. Bastian was starting to flag. Bring Michael and Morgan on, move Ander up front in place of Mata. Would have secured the midfield and Ander can grab you a goal.

803~~~
Not sure why he was taken off tbh

804~~~
The curious case of Ander Herrera, he'll work hard no matter where you play him but in this formation he just doesn't feel like a natural fit in the double pivot or as a #10, but certainly better at the latter IMO.

805~~~
Yes. Definitely one of our 11 best players. Agreed.

806~~~
Looks better at #10 than Mata.

807~~~
Definitely. People wanted to know how Juan would perform there, now we know. Juan was not very good against Liverpool, so he is off form atm.

808~~~
He doesn't fit in a two cm midfield for me, not under LvG at least.

809~~~
Not sure why he's always first pick to be taken off when we need to chase a game. LVG needs his head checked and soon.

810~~~
No idea why he got taken off.

811~~~
We know based off one game where a freak injury ended up changing the game? We've a far larger sample size of that from Mata's playing career outside of United.

812~~~
Play him as an a/m it's for me the obv choice and in a 2 with someone like scheiderlin. Facing the opposition goal as the 3rd man he's got a lot to offer, energy, workrate and an ability to link up, run in to channels, get in to the box and finish. Push him up to number ten where he's expected to hold of defenders isn't his strength whilst he's shown some nice touches. Fabregas, mata, Silva, Iniesta etc are all the same. They want to be closer to the midfield than the striker as they're away from the centrebacks and can often get in behind the midfield.

813~~~
Not a good day, but didn't deserve to get subbed off. He's a fighter, he doesn't hide, but maybe the philosophy prefers measured, controlled, and gutless robots to someone who cares and is willing to bust a gut. Perennially disallowed.

814~~~
Bit of a contradiction there, no? If he was off form anyway then a poor performance today hardly proves he can't play #10. Especially when some of the elements of his game that deserted him today have nothing to do with the position he was in.

I mean Herrera had even more of a nightmare playing in midfield a few weeks ago but that doesn't mean he can't play in midfield. In fact I still think playing as a b2b midfielder is his best position....

815~~~
Yep it is.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> My head isn't straight tonight at all. Just hearing more about Luke has upset me more. I hope we hammer them when they come to OT.

816~~~
He's been playing very cautios. He always goes for the safe optioni nowadays or turns around and plays it backwards. His strength though is to bring the ball forward, quick play and passes, movement off the ball. Let's hope he brings that out again (or is allowed to bring that out again)

817~~~
Didn't think he was a great yesterday, he's not a LVG type midfielder (slow possession type), not sure if we will see the best out of him with the philosophy.

818~~~
Does not look comfortable playing in a deeper role.

819~~~
Hopefully he will now be our number one number 10. The way we played last night both Mata and him looked out of position. I don’t mind him in midfield against weaker opponents but he’s much better as AM.

820~~~
This. Its a pity that in our current setup we don't have room for an out and out B2B. Herrera can do a job as a deep CM or an attacking 10, but these are not his natural roles to me

821~~~
I'd play him as a right attacking midfielder. That is when he was at his best last season

822~~~
I agree, he needs to be closer to the midfield than the forwards, the inverted triangle in 4-3-3 is the system that suits his skill set most, but now we aren't using it I feel he's not having the same impact and will need to up his performance in the double pivot to get game time as Rooney is going to get the #10 role IMO.

823~~~
Yeah, I just don't get the obsession with LVG with playing effectively a second striker there when his players suit a slightly deeper role. I can see Rooney dropping deeper as well. Don't think it's the best idea personally as Rooney as a number 10 and it's the same issue with Fellaini in some ways, is that what they want to do doesn't suit what our wide players, mata/depay want to do. Rooney will shift it wide and then get in the box but mata/depay don't want to be pinned wide. Where as herrera will actually link up with them in that position. You can still end up with the same number of players in the box but we can work Depay/mata in to areas they are best suited too.

824~~~
he indeed was very good there last year.

for my 2 p, i'd like to line united up like this when people are healthy:

---rooney - martial
de pay - mata - herrera
----schweinsteiger - schneiderlin
shaw - blind - smalling - darmian
--------- de gea

but of course, that'd result in us having 12 players and you just <i>KNOW</i> that teams like liverpool would complain about that.

825~~~
I think it all comes down purely to goals, if our front 3 were prolific I reckon he'd probably stick with the inverted midfield 3 as opposed to a second striker/#10 system. The thing I feel he's missing in this is both Herrera and Fellaini were bigger goal threats last season playing deeper. Of course another issue may be that he feels Schweinsteiger suits a double pivot better than the inverted midfield 3 system.

826~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

827~~~
You could argue that Rooney and Mata add up to about 1 in their current form... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

828~~~
He needs to start.

829~~~
Of course he does. I would have taken Rooney off for him. LvG decided to let Paddy have some time which is good for him. Ander will play during the week, so can get time then. Bet Rooney bloody plays up front so no matter what balls they put through he will either deflect them into the stands or can't get on the end of them. Sigh.

830~~~
I would have done the same. Rooney was shit and Herrera could have helped in the middle and brought the ball forward much quicker to feed our attacking players

831~~~
Should clearly be ahead of Rooney for the #10 position. Although there are probably 3 or 4 others like that as well. Should be starting.

832~~~
Will start mid-week and at the weekend after a horrible performance by Rooney. Hoping to see him play behind Wilson in the League Cup game with few minutes for Martial as a sub.

833~~~
He's in a tough spot, I don't think LvG likes him in the double pivot and he has to displace Rooney to get the other role he can play in the current system.

834~~~
I'm a fan but I am not convinced by him in the double pivot, he plays on the line too much for that role IMO.

835~~~
not sure if we see he best out of him when Van Gaal's here, he's creative little player who can do all stuff, he's not cleverley who should play it safe backwards. Understand Mr. Van Gaal? He really brought fear into some palyer's eyes so they are too tidy afraid of risky passes. tbf 60minutes were really poor from us today, we won because they were shit.

836~~~
By his standards he's having a poor season so far. I expected a lot more from him. Hopefully he improves like last season.

837~~~
I feel this is how LVG wants him to play, we all loved Herrera, how he started last season constantly trying through balls, good in tackle actually and always on the run giving options, so basically a very good midfielder, and a stark contrast from our Anderson, Cleverley and co. After the Leicester city debacle and moulding his game according to LVG's liking he is getting more starts which suggests he is happy with him. 

Last night i actually dont remember a single poor pass from him, his passing stats must be above 95%, but i feel he is very much playing within himself and one thing i have noticed with him, he plays first time passes far too much, and at times he has more time and if he turns he might actually have more say in the games with assists and goals. but i feel the risk of losing possession has supressed him somewhat..

838~~~
One thing i noticed is how more adventurous he was once Mata was off. It seemed like Schweinsteiger and Fellaini were the midfield protection, while Herrera was more of an AM with Pereira, Depay and Martial in front.

It's obvious he's capable of much more. He had an okay game but poor for his standards. But I absolutely love his style and hope he becomes something more than second tier player for van Gaal.

839~~~
When's he back, we need someone to play number 10 the way he does urgently.

840~~~
Injured?

841~~~
He injects some urgency into our play. Need him back desperately

842~~~
I said it before, play him in a 3-men midfield, especially away from home. He has not played too well so far but certainly he's better than Rooney or Carrick

843~~~
Not according to the manager.

844~~~
That opinion by the manager will be why we don't do as well as we should. Too stubborn for his own good.

845~~~
He's injured but what difference does it make. The captain must always play. Must be an immensely strong character not to be fed up with this shit.

846~~~
Remember when Ander Herrera played for regularly for us? Do it Louis. Do it.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vckmt3-5IkE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

847~~~
yeah, fecking Van Gaal not picking an injured player.

848~~~
Has it actually been confirmed what his injury is?

849~~~
Physioroom says a knock. Well that's helpful.

850~~~
He's been in out and out of the team when fit, which shouldn't be the case.

851~~~
i love herrera, but i get a creepy kagawa vibe whenever i come into this thread...

852~~~
That first saxophone song house dance thing is fecking amazing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

853~~~
Technically brilliant, but he's been very wasteful in his recent outings. I think he needs to tighten up his passing if he wants LvG to seriously consider him.

854~~~
Seems to be back in  training which is great news, no idea what his injury was but most importantly he's returned as we face a difficult set of fixtures with Everton,  CSKA and City.

Hasn't impressed as much when played so far this season but he really does make us tick when he gets going. A 3 of Basti, Schneiderlin and him would be absolutely awesome with a run of games! Unfortunately we are not going to see it.

I am still staggered that after our midfield signings at the start of the season we still aren't playing LVG's famous 4-3-3 with these guys.

856~~~
What a guy.

857~~~
Fast becoming one of my favourite players at the club, he's a class midfielder. Happy to see him get minutes and a goal.

858~~~
It is difficult to understand why Louis Van Gaal seems to see Ander Herrera as a peripheral player. United's best performances under Van Gaal have happened when Herrera has played. Again, so far today, Herrera has given United that bit extra in midfield. More speed in the passing, more cleverness on the ball, more energy off the ball. If Herrera keeps going like this, and still gets dropped, you have to wonder what he has to do to convince Van Gaal that he is United quality.

859~~~
He's been brilliant today. He's really proven that he must start for United from now on.

860~~~
Both him and Schneiderlin are menaces.

861~~~
Will become undroppable, again. Impressive stuff from him, a gift that keeps on giving. Curious to see if Van Gaal drops Memphis next game.

862~~~
It's just us fan boys wanting him play, right? Damn, if he doesn't get more starts (I think he should be a regular in the first team) than he does, LVG is a fecking idiot.

863~~~
He just links everything up, never stops moving and creating angles. When we are out of possession he hassles everyone, with intelligence too as he cuts out passing channels.

864~~~
Same as last season really. Couldn't find his way into the team after an impressive start, but became arguably our best outfield player once he was instated as a starting XI regular. Hope Van Gaal has stumbled onto a stable setup again for the second time in two seasons, and this is the first of many starts for Ander. In his absence we really miss that dynamic element that no other midfielder (apart from Schneiderlin) provides, and unlike Morgan he is a major attacking threat when given a bit of freedom. The fact that he scored the most goals for a United midfielder since Scholes 2004/2005, and in just 28 starts is somehow minimized. Just love the energy and hustle he plays with, willing runner, not afraid to try something different (points docked in the current system), presses like a hyena off the ball, refreshing change of pace from some of our other static displays. Perfect linkup man for our forwards, somehow raises the tempo of the entire team, just as he did last season too to be fair.

865~~~
if hererra doesn't get a look in our team after that performance than nothing will.

866~~~
The best individual performance of any of our players this season. He's was immense! Was an absolute leader out there.. So vocal

867~~~
Safe to say we've missed him.

868~~~
Fantastic performance, hope he puts Depay on his ass on the bench because he's well more deserved of the spot at the moment.

869~~~
This.is.why.

1. Midfield trio.
2. Ander.

870~~~
All I can say after Herrera's performance today is that I hope Van Gaal starts to trust him now. There were times, especially when Herrera made late runs into the box for crosses, where he could have been a short haired Jari Litmanen. We all know the qualities Herrera brings to the team. Somehow though he keeps getting dropped. We play so much better with Herrera in the pitch, even when he doesn't produce a goal and assist as he did today. Still, you always feel that he's only one quiet half away from spending two months in the wilderness. For some reason the manager just doesn't trust him.

871~~~
This. He brings so much to the team when he plays.

872~~~
His first start in a long while and he gives us an assist and a goal, not to mention he runs tirelessly all game, links up well and has some really good defensive contributions.

If he does not start against the bitters next game i am seriously going to question Van Gaals sanity.

873~~~
3 goals and 3 assists already, despite not featuring all the time and having a spell out injured.

Like Mata, he always racks up good numbers and is very efficient in his play.

8 United goals from 10 shots on target or something, was the stat floating about earlier I think.

874~~~
Love the guy. Works his bollocks off and lifts our tempo so much in the final third. A real gem.

875~~~
Good game and that comes on the back of limited football so far this season. Looked much more comfortable being able to drift around more rather than being stuck as a high #10 and adds some much needed bite, energy and tempo to the entire team.

876~~~

877~~~
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

878~~~
He's a brilliant player who is positive with and without the ball and it's what we've been missing. You can't have Carrick and Schneiderlin sat in front of our CB's you need at least one midfield player who makes forward runs. He was exceptional today and made life easier for the rest of the team. That today was the balance we need.

879~~~
As long as he's fit, he needs to play. LVG really needs to stick with him from now on - he's the one that needs to be undroppable ffs!

880~~~
It is completely bewildering that LVG doesn't rate Herrera enough to start him whenever he is fit.

881~~~
Carrick/Bastain + Schneiderlin + Herrera

882~~~
Another unbelievable game from him, particularly when he was paired up with Mata in the first half

883~~~
He's a great player. No question about that.

884~~~
Like 1 poster said, he adds that dynamism to our attack which is needed.

Very good performance.

885~~~
Because there is more to a game than just a great player of a certain sort? Sometimes...and we have seen it...he doesn't fit the opposition...simple as that. I trust the guys that study the opposition to judge that.

886~~~
Decisive player for this team

887~~~
It's downright silly that he doesn't hold a regular place in the first team.

888~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

889~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

890~~~
Excellent game from him, really is the heartbeat when he plays. 

BFS + schneiderlin + Herrera is our best possible combo and should start every game.

891~~~
feck off

892~~~
He is actually getting better when not playing, imagine how good he could become if given regular playing time!

893~~~
Fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

894~~~
All im saying is, this is the guy who is benched to accommodate Rooney into the XI. "OKE"

895~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

896~~~
I got to admit, I would be playing over Rooney at this point, certainly off the striker anyway.

897~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Definitely reads the caf.

898~~~
people are laughing aswell!

899~~~
Fantastic today, I actually gave Smalling MoTM but I can see why so many gave it to Ander with his all round performance plus a goal and an assist to show for it. Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Carrick are all excellent midfielders, but Herrera seems to add some urgency and life to our play that's sometimes missing whenever he's not on the pitch. Him and Schneiderlin made a big difference I think.

900~~~
It's hard to get excited with his performances or potential because I just know that LvG is waiting for one mistake or for his favourites to pick up form before dropping him like a sack of shit because he has a way shorter leash than a everyone else. Great game today and like we have been saying, we don't lose much in attack when we play him proving again that LvG is full of shit when he says ge prefers his 10 to be more a second striker than a midfielder yet we suffer creatively because his 10s create a huge disconnect between the front two and the rest of the midfield. This guy gives us offensive and defensive balance plus our attacks do not break down because of a shit first touch or a poor short passing game.

901~~~

902~~~
Need a gif of him kissing Mata's forehead after the 2nd goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

903~~~
Great to have him back fit and in form right before the City game. We missed him against Arsenal (and Schneiderlin), but Van Gaal singling him out as the star man today probably means that he'll start next week as well. As he should. Just gives us so much.

904~~~
I never understood why he got benched. While I'm not in the Herrera fanboy club like some here, he's a great player and I can't remember a really poor performance by him. He's very versatile and thus always contributes in one way or another. There's no reason to not keep playing him.

905~~~
He just keeps winning him over. Now stick with him for god sake!

906~~~
Play a proper midfield 3 and play Herrera and we are a better team both defensively and offensively.

907~~~
It was that West Brom away game last season, he just came back from injury but he was absolutely terrible. Came off at half time and was relegated to the bench for aaaages until he came back in and dominated games.

I think there was a similar game this season where Herrera looked really poor but I can't remember which one it was.

908~~~
Absolutely. He needs to play every game.

909~~~
Praise the Lord! Now don't drop him LVG!

910~~~
Would people be happy to see Martial shunted out wide (although he still plays very well there) to accommodate Herrera in midfield?

911~~~
Whilst Martial played well on the left Rooney is guy guy who should be shunted out on the left because Martial just gives us so much more playing uptop -  his hold up play, dribbling and a much better short passing game could see us build something beautiful with Herrera and Mata. The problem would be width but Martial drifts around a lot so it's won't be as big an issue.

912~~~
I'm not normally one of the ones blinded by Hererra love here but he made a huge difference to us today. He was outstanding.

913~~~
Man of the match comfortably.

Spanish Lampard does it again. Bizarre how he isn't a guaranteed starter in our current squad.

914~~~
Rooney cant drive the flank pace wise and will always come inside on his right foot. It seems Martial is better both up top and doing his job for the team shape if playing on the left, as Rooney has to be shoehorned in somewhere.

915~~~
I understand that but Rooney isn't pulling up trees playing as the striker, was giving away the ball for fun today before his goal so he is the one I'd shunt out wide to minimize his disruption to our flow. It's true that he won'r drive us from the wing like Martial did today but there he'd get more time on the ball and maybe get to link up with the LB.

916~~~
He should be the first midfielder on our team sheet.

917~~~
It was just a perfect number 10 display today from him. Assist, goal and helped both midfield and attack a lot. It was like having both second striker and 3rd midfielder on the pitch.

918~~~
But there's this one thing I don't understand yet. He was dropped because of poor performances but other players were poor too, right?

919~~~
This and explains why the b.s Lvg spouts to justify freezing him out is so fecking infuriating. He's got a set of attributes that make him perfect for the role in this role and in this league where you need the majority of your team to put in a shift.

920~~~
Him and Schneiderlin simply have to start. Basti and Carrick can rotate for the third spot! 

We look so much more dangerous going forward with him playing.

921~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ic5r" width="560"></iframe>

Love how he has the time to complain about the foul on Martial before running in the box to head it in. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

922~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Only just noticed that.

923~~~
We knew what he delivers, end product. Last season he got 9 goals with very limited playing time until February or something along those lines. If he's consistently played we could see him ending up with something like 15 goals and 10 assists by the end of the season. He is that kind of player.

924~~~
Certainly made his case to start more regularly today. Very impressive performance. Not that I think that it will actually happen however.

925~~~
And on top of that, its a late run into the box to meet a cross with a headed goal. Love midfield goals like that.

In a position where he basically needs to start every match possible especially when Mata is on the pitch.

926~~~
Other than the goal, his pass for Rooney's goal was so perfectly timed and weighted. His performance today in the #10 role, you can't ask for anything more. Hopefully he has earned some consecutive starts in that role now.

927~~~
Bastian's look and pass to Martial before the foul were great.

928~~~
He's so creative but he is not weak defensively like Mata, Ozil or Silva. He should be the perfect number 10 for Van Gaal, as he can score goals too.

929~~~
He needs to start every game. We're a better team with him in it. Its just that simple really.

930~~~
Incredible how efficient he is. Give him a good chance and he will most likely score. That is something i havent expected and seen from him in Spain, but he has a killer instinct for a midfielder in front of goal.

931~~~
Brilliant.

Shades of Rooney vs. Newcastle when he was bitching to the referee about a foul seconds before smashing in goal of the season.

932~~~
Is he the most two-footed player in our team? I can't think of anyone else who's so good on both sides.

933~~~
Schweinsteiger is really good on either foot... Never really noticed that as being a particularly strong point of Herrera. Not a weak point of course, just nothing hugely noticeable like it is with Cazorla for example.

934~~~
He makes Rooney and the rest of the team play better. He is extremely efficient as a player. He is also giving instructions. I loved seeing him talking to Lindgard when he came on. He really should be the 2nd or 3rd name on team sheet after De Gea and Smalling. His energy, variety, and technical ability fits in perfectly with Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger. I just fear Van Gaal will bench him again at the first chance. Had Young been fit we might have seen Rooney in the hole. We have been in this place before so I don't want to get my hopes up that he will be a permanent starter.

935~~~
He is really tailor made for no.10 role. So consistent and composed. I have always said he is one of the most calmest players on the ball even when surrounded by opposition players. Needs to start every important game

936~~~
Andreas is.

937~~~
The way he was talking to everyone in the midfield and telling them what to do was amazing. It's like having an extra captain.

938~~~
Look was but the pass wasn't as great as it could have been. Who knows - the goal may not have happened if the pass was perfect, so no complaints!

939~~~
It wasn't that great because it wasn't easy. He had to awkwardly bend himself.

940~~~
Brilliant game from him. I have to say I wasn't pleased with his performances this season but that was more like the Herrera we know. Hope he keeps it up.

941~~~
He was injured before that game and played the game with a back support and understandably was poor. He took a month to recover and played vs Hull after being fit and assisted a goal for rvp.

As for this season he was poor vs Southampton. 

When on the left flank Herrera puts in brilliant crosses with his left foot. Saw one yesterday and last season he crossed to young in the derby with his left.

942~~~
There was a guy on here last week who said he doesn't see what Herrera can bring to the team and the he shouldn't be picked. I left that discussion at one point but by now it should be pretty obvious

943~~~
It does drive you mad, when both herrera and morgan should have started alongside bastian against arsenal, yet VG choose the ageing legs of carrick and rooney. Once again, VG has to learn that he has got to start playing guys like herrera and Morgan week in week out, who Herrera does help us flood and overrun teams, and keep the ball moving at a quicker tempo. It is probably the first time since scholes was in his prime, we have a player like Herrera who can score those cracking goals from distance, and ghosting into the box

944~~~
He also played a nice cross for Fellaini with his left foot, in the 2-1 win against Stoke.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIeNByQRow4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

945~~~
Anyone have any GIF/videos of him ordering the team around just before the second half? It was hilarious.

946~~~
He is a class act, on and off the pitch. Hope he gets a run, absolutely clinical.

947~~~
Yeah i like that. Till now we have Rooney as a real captain, Schweinsteiger and Smalling who are captains even if they don't have armband, De Gea who got armband few weeks ago and some said he would be a great captain and now Herrera as an extra captain.
By the end of the seasons we will have 11 captains on the pitch, beat that if you can.

948~~~
The team just ticks so much better with him in it. One thing that stood out for me, was when Lingard came on at HT it showed him talking to him and giving him instructions, absolutely fantastic player.

949~~~
I'm not a huge supporter of Herrera. There is a over-the-top love-in on this forum for him, BUT yesterday's MOTM performance was fully deserved.
I do believe that he is our best No.10 and should be starting every game.
<b>
The problem though, is that Rooney is undroppable. So, how can Herrera play regularly with Rooney in the team?
</b>
Yesterday Memphis was taken out of the team, but I don't see this happening regularly. I think Memphis & Rooney are LVG's favourite players.
The only scenario where I can see Herrera breaking into the team (and staying) is if Rooney gets a long term injury. I say long term, because if Rooney only misses 2-3 games, you know that he will immediately go back in and Herrera will get benched.

950~~~

951~~~
Wonderful

952~~~
Efficient.

953~~~
Herrera was still injured for the arsenal match.  but agree, if he was fit he should have played

954~~~
Seems clear to me that both Martial and Herrera are better options at the present time than Rooney. Would like to see the 4-2-3-1 given a go with Herrera at the #10 behind Martial.

955~~~
who the feck is he to give instructions to BFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

956~~~
He could be our 04-06 Lampard.

957~~~
The thing that impresses me most is his finishing, very rarely makes a hash of it, always calm and composed and I think his strike against Howard in the first half was one of the first I have seen him just put his foot through without trying to pick a corner.

Just an incredibly cool head in scoring positions.

958~~~
Spot perfect on.

959~~~
Some people have made a life through deferring to authority so I guess it shouldn't be surprising to see such comments. The boy makes a massive difference to our team such that it should be obvious what he brings to the side but some are too defensive because admitting his quality will automatically make them question the deficiencies found in certain untouchables who are done at this level.

It's ridiculous how he's not cemented a spot in the starting eleven because he deserves it, I can't recall a match for us where he's been poor. He always seem to have some sort impact in every game he plays for us and he tends to score as well.

964~~~
Ah right, did not know he was injured, my bad. No excuse from VG why Morgan was left out. Those 2 have to start in a 3 man midfield, we say we lack goals, well herrera seems to be the go to guy who can chip in with the goals. VG talks about philosophy hammering it home, well herrera fits it perfect in that 3 man midfield. Bastian, herrera, morgan, mata and Martial in a midfield 5 can ruin city, by the sheer numbers and speed in the way they could attack, use it VG

965~~~
It seems like he just needs a bit of time on the training ground to understand what LvG requires of the role he has to play, it was the same last year suddently he just got it and had a superb second half of the season. Very likeable player, it helps that he tries to understand what the club is about and you can see his passion on the pitch, also being vocal giving instructions to his teammates on the pitch.

Really hope he can nail down that #10 position, it would save us having to buy a new one in the summer.

966~~~
Herrera was injured against Arsenal, he wasn't even in the squad and Morgan was unused substitute. Maybe he has a niggle, you never know. I don't believe if they were fit and available, he will choose not to play them. He's not a fool you know.

967~~~
Honestly, he seems like he's one of the best players on the pitch every time he plays. I don't think he needed time on the training ground to understand what Van Gaal wants (apart from when he first came to United probably), but I think he's just not starting every game because of the competition we have for the 3 in the middle. For the holding midfielders, we all know that's not his best position, though he's decent at it. Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin should be starting there when fit. Mata has the right wing spot his own, so to play, he needs to start as a #10. Performance wise, he is fully deserving of starting every game, but his problem is he needs to compete with Rooney basically. To have herrera in, we need to play either Rooney or Martial on the wing, or bench one of them, and Rooney won't be benched as he's the captain. I'm sure Van Gaal does rate him highly, it's just he values Rooney's presence as captain really highly so doesn't want to drop him.

968~~~
I think you are talking about me in which case I never said he shouldn't be picked. All I said was that this season before yesterday's game, he didn't do enough in the games he played to show he was integral to the team. A lot of other posters also agreed that he hadn't really played well this season before yesterday even though in September, he was on the bench only for one game out of the 5 he was available for (which was against Sunderland). And I said pretty clearly that he will get his chances and he will prove himself and get back into the team both of which he did.

969~~~
I think this is spot on. He can only play in the AM role for us regularly, and it’s a pity because a) Rooney will always play b) Martial is by far our most threatening player so he shall always play c) Mata is our best player on the right wing and d) Memphis is very highly rated by van Gaal, hence he got so much time to find his feet (I disagree with this tactic btw).

I really think Herrera is extremely unlucky. In a normal, healthy team I suppose Rooney would find himself on the bench, so would Memphis- replaced by Martial and Young respectively. I think it would make much better team with Herrera behind the front trio than what we’ve been playing recently. I guess that until Young/Memphis comes back, Herrera will get his chance. But unfortunately I wouldn’t bet on him staying in the team longer, he’s the victim of circumstances.

970~~~
I don't think it's spot on. Before we bought Martial, Rooney was used as the main striker and one of Depay or Januzaj were starting in the second striker role. VG has mentioned multiple times that he prefers "his number 10" to be a SS. He doesn't see him as a 6 or "his 10", and we don't play with a 8. Don't think he was the victim of circumstances, more a victim of the manager's vision for his team.

Hopefully, Herrera has forced the manager to change that with his superlative performance in the last game, and we'll see more of him in the first XI as an attacking midfielder, bridging the gap between the midfield and the attack.

971~~~
He's always been good enough, his problem is Rooney. With Rooneys position in the side beyond contestation someone has to miss out and that someone has been Herrera.

972~~~
No.

973~~~
Yes? Eh?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

974~~~
he is our best midfielder by a mile at the moment. The only one showing pure world class.

975~~~
You know that is asking for trouble here don't you?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

976~~~
Rooney was not the only reason keeping Herrera out.

977~~~
Fair enough.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

978~~~
We should not play Herrera in every match we play now to prevent burnout. He should play regularly in the second half of the season, he'll be fresh and not fatigued then.

979~~~
If we play him now and then don't play him for the second half of the season we can have him properly refreshed for the start of the 2016/17 campaign.

980~~~
Who/what else was? Herrera is by far the better #10, Martial by far the better #9 yet Rooney <i>always </i>starts.

981~~~
Was reading the match report in the Express today and for all Herrera and Smalling put in fabulous performances it is mainly about Rooney. Sigh.

982~~~
I don't believe it's all doom and gloom for Herrera. After all, he did get a special mention for his performance at Goodison from LvG which is something that doesn't happen very often. As for the personnel i think Martial, with his performance on the left wing, kind of "opened up" a spot for the #10 position. He really made Coleman look like a championship player and we have to take into consideration that a natural dribbler, more so someone who can ridicule the opposition FB on his strong foot is something that we desperately need in the wide areas. If that's the case, Rooney will be pushed up front.

Tactically wise, i think Herrera will always be a candidate for the starting xi as long as LvG continues to set his team to press and defend a bit deeper than usual. After the fiasco at the Emirates and with the fear that Lukaku would beat our defenders to the ball and invite runs from the players around him LvG decided to go for a more cautious approach off the ball. When you give the opponent a few yards on the pitch <i><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">and</span></b></i> do your defending right, then you can be more direct on the ball cause there are more spaces to exploit. Under these circumstances Herrera can thrive.

That special mention from the manager wasn't a coincidence. The assist came from what LvG describes as "half zones" in between the opposition lines and it's where he believes that the best assists/through balls can come from because the player on the ball can see all the off the ball movement and make the right decision. Mata starts from the right and has absolute freedom to search for this kind of passes. The goal was an excellent run towards the far post, a "classic" second striker move.

Add his nearly perfect passing percentage and the fact the he did much better at protecting possession in the attacking half and you have the whole picture. The only issue here is that probably LvG doesn't expect that these spaces behind the defense will always be there. I doubt he'll ever choose to defend even deeper and go for a more gung ho style as he desires/demands control of the tempo. In that case the spaces have to be found in between the lines and it's pretty obvious why he'd prefer a Bergkamp-Litmanen-Mueller type of player there. I like to think that the manager is on the verge of accepting the fact that Rooney, with his current woeful first touch and his inability to play with his back to goal, isn't suitable for that role. Instead, he still has pace to look for runs off the shoulders of the defenders. So, the different tactics we use whenever we have to deal with a very physical forward (Goodison, St Mary's, Liverpool game) could be used more often and with Martial showing ability on the wings, Herrera will get more playing time.

983~~~
Well your first mistake there was buying the Express.

984~~~
Could be right, one day I read the Mirror one day the Express. I think I'm just confused.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

is how we should line up v CSKA as our front 4.

986~~~
We should go 4-3-3 against most teams in the PL and in Europe. That not only helps us to control midfield better but also enables playing our best players in their best positions (bar Martial as we still have Rooney who will play regardless). That will surely give Herrera more chances and I think with him being at the top of a centre 3 with BFS and Morgan behind will be brilliantly balanced.

987~~~
From F365

988~~~
Is there a bigger idiot than Garth Crooks?

989~~~
No.

990~~~
We should go 4-3-3 for each and everyone of our games, it's the most balanced and adaptable system, you keep the system and change the personal depending on how attacking or how solid you want to be.

991~~~
Herrera also plays as an 8 and we brought in a few CMs in the summer. His competition is not only Rooney

992~~~
Hope we not gonna see same thing again, Rooney taking his place and LvG putting him in midfield 2 where he does not look that good,which will lead to LvG dropping him on the bench.

993~~~
He can play as an 8, much like Smalling <i>can </i>play as a right back but we certainly wouldn't consider the signing of Darmian as reason of his exclusion from the starting line up. LVG considers Herrera an attacking midfielder, it also happens to be by far the best we have.

994~~~
Last season he played most games as an 8, I agree hes the best we have at 10 right now, but please lets not reinvent. He is not an 8 like Smalling is a RB. The guy has played most of his career as an 8.

995~~~
He was playing as the attacking midfielder for Bilbao and that's what we signed him as, an attacking midfielder. Do you believe LVGs preference would be to play him in place of Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger or behind the striker? I know what my money is on.

996~~~
He played <b>ONE </b>season at 10 for Bilbao, and I never said anything about LVG preference, only that he has more competition tha just Rooney since he is not only a 10. Infact LVG only started playing him at 10 this season. For me he should be in the team either at 10 or in a midfield 3 with Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger.

However last season he was one of our betters players playing at 8, not sure why people are now trying so hard to forget this.

997~~~
Why does that hold any relevance that <b>ONE </b>season was his most recent there and he's been identified as an attacking midfielder ever since.

LVGs preference is a rather significant factor seeing as he is the manager. If he sees him as an attacking midfielder  (which he does) then he's going to be competing with other attacking midfielders ie Rooney.

998~~~
Sigh.... ok. You know LVG played him as an 8 and also a 6 last season.. I'm only saying that he is not only a 10 and so is not only competing with Rooney. Infact he has also played 8 this season. I don't see why that is so hard to grasp, also he was already identified as a United target before that season he played at Bilbao btw.

999~~~
I'm fully aware of him having played in different positions, you seem to be struggling to understand my original and very simple point that if Rooney didn't exist he would be starting every game, how do you not understand this?

Yes and in that time we changed managers, what does Moyes' view on a Herrera have to with how LVG views Herrera? LVG has always identified Herrera as an attacking midfielder.

1000~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1001~~~
Because I don't believe it to be true. For one Fellaini has started at 10 before him this season and last, Januzaj and Memphis too this season.
Herrera was dropped last season from the 8 position for apparently no reason too. It hasn't only been Rooney who has been keeping him from starting games, which was my point. LVG is obviously a bit insane when it comes to Herrera

1002~~~
It seems they are people  here that dislike Herrera simply for the reason that a lot of people like him. That is just weird. Surely a player's performances should be the determinant.

1003~~~
It's like that with loads of people on here. Any player who has a bit of a cult following on here have others go against him purely because others like him. So weird.

1004~~~
Herrera has been a very good player for us, scored lots of goals, professional, never complains when benched, no attitude problems..seems to relish playing for the club...Its weird indeed, and sad in equal measure.

1005~~~
Him and mata are my favorite players. Both have such good ball control and vision and both chip in with goals.

1006~~~
Garth Crooks:
Right you are, Garth.

1007~~~
If Herrera was British things would have been pretty different.

1008~~~
That Crooks comment is just so unbelievably stupid.

1009~~~
Nepotism eh devilish.

1010~~~
Bias. Barkley is not as good as Herrera. Also the former is more comfortable at no 10 and we already have 4 NO 10s (Rooney, Mata, Januzaj and Fellaini). I don't mind us buying British players. However they must be as good/better to what we have and in positions we actually need. (I wouldn't mind if we get Stones for example)

1011~~~
Mind boggles.. " To Rooney's Detriment!! " <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1012~~~
Don't understand how any United fan could dislike Herrera. Fantanstic player AND great lad too

1013~~~
Either depay or rooney should moke way for herrera, I almost call herrera our frank lampard, if VG built the team around him. If VG put him in the advanced role, he can score goals from distance, he always is on the end of things, and is quiet capable of scoring penalty's. It is a mystery how he is even seen has a bench player, VG should know better. Herrera's goals record has been better than rooney's yet VG continues to play him, when its herrera who has been producing yet VG puts him on the bench

Our best midfield and attack probably is?

Bastian Morgan
herrera
Martial, rooney or depay, mata

1014~~~
Like being kept out of the national team instead by 2 players not as good who don't play well together?

1015~~~
It boggles the mind how he thinks we have to have a SS even though that makes us prone to getting overrun, barcelona at the height if their dominance never played with a SS, and VG must play Bastian, Morgan and Herrera, it would give us so much control, Martial has really given us that acceleration, play the 3 and we could do what we did against everton

Bastian
Morgan herrera
Martial rooney mata

damn that midfield 3 and attacking trio would give us so much balance, its right infront of VG, and we will see what he does against city. We play that team, city are going to find it very hard to keep up

1016~~~
erm what?

1017~~~
Very poor out of him in that first half. If it had been Rooney playing that many balls out to Valencia, the caf would have shut down with all the traffic. Can see him being replaced at half time. Correctly in my opinion.

1018~~~
Has had some lovely touches in tight areas, but far too little movement around him. He's been part of our most dangerous plays tho. If you can call them, that.

1019~~~
He might be our best bet at #10 but he isn't a #10. Not ideal.

1020~~~
Eh? He's been our only performer in that half, managed to find himself space quite regularly,  it's just unfortunate he has nothing ahead of him to play the final ball.

1021~~~
Agreed. The ball is plodded to him and he's doing really well to weave a man and receive, but there is nothing ahead of him.

1022~~~
Heh

I thought he was possibly our best player without being anything special

1023~~~
Meh. Not a lot of space to operate, and little movement up front, but the "pass it to Valencia" tactic clearly isn't working. Best of the bad bunch though.

1024~~~
he's been our brightest player in terms of passing but that isn't saying much

Valencia has been our only real outlet against a solid tight defence

1025~~~
When playing number 10, you have to be more adventurous. You have to make things happen. It's funny, when there's no movement for Ander, it gets pointed out. If Rooney plays there and plays the ball wide that often, no mention of poor movement is made. I'd be surprised if he lasts the full 90 minutes if he continues playing as he did in that first half. He was playing easy ball too often. Wasn't looking to give and go. Instead, it was get the ball and pass wide or backwards.

1026~~~
Doing really good things but then passing out wide instead of forwards - Probably under instructions to not take risks or he'll be benched again.

1027~~~
Best performer in that half ain't saying much. Anyway, I wasn't really criticising him, just pointing out that it isn't his best position. In the long term we could really do with a quality #10.

1028~~~
Probably our best player in that half. Started poorly I thought but got a lot better and has some lovely touches. Nothing really came of anything though and we haven't created any chances yet. So you could say he's been decent at best, with the others poor.

1029~~~
Wonderful through ball for Valencia for that goal. Forced his run into the box and left him with 1 thing to do, cross. Minimised Valencia's thought process with that pass and we can't thank him enough for it tonight.

1030~~~
Ha. Very true. Has played a few nice forward passes in this second half, which is what I felt was missing first half. Great pass for the goal.

1031~~~
Another very good game from him. Very sensible in possession, hardly wasted a ball despite being our most adventurous player passing wise.

1032~~~
He was shit, he did nothing a number ten is supposed to do.

1033~~~
He seems quite hot and cold as a player. One excellent performance certainly doesn't guarantee another will follow it. He was ok though.

1034~~~
Hope he's ok, was wincing holding his side at the end.

Excellent through ball to Valencia in the lead up to the goal.

1035~~~
It's blatantly obvious now it has to be him, Morgan and Bastian/Carrick as the midfield.

1036~~~
I saw him holding his side. Hope that isn't a problem.

1037~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Don't know what game you were watching or what's wrong with your eyesight. He was one of our best players today. Needs to start in a midfield trio for us regularly.

1038~~~
Herrara and Schneiderlin must be the mainstay in midfield now.

1039~~~
Beautiful ball in the build up to the goal.

1040~~~
Was hoping he was just winded at first, but then seemed a bit more then that. Hopefully nothing more then just a bit of a knock and he'll be fine.

1041~~~
Only played a beautiful through ball leading to the goal, I take it number 10's don't do that?

1042~~~
Huh? played a wonderful through ball to valencia for the goal and created the headed chance for rooney. Was the only one trying to speed up the play. I thought he was far and away our motm.

1043~~~
I've noticed with Herrera he's never taking his time to make the pass. He's so aware of what's going on he's looking to release it quickly to the right player or the right area. It's why we play so much better with him in the side; he has the ability to sharpen the tempo.

1044~~~
Did well in the second half. Spent less time dawdling on the ball.

Strange perception of him tbh. I think he's underrated by opposition fans, but overrated by United fans.

1045~~~
He was good. The criticisms are odd in that he was the least of our problems.

1046~~~
had a good enough game , not great not bad.

1047~~~
He was essential to our 30 mins of good play in the second half but not great outside of it. Better in a midfield three rather than as a #10.

1048~~~
I thought he held the ball up well and linked well with Lingard.

1049~~~
Nobody was fabulous, but as you say we had a couple of real problems playing for us tonight and Ander was not one of them. At least he does try to create. Wayne just destroys most of our attacks.

1050~~~
I like Lingard.

1051~~~
He was rubbish in the first half, but then became a lot better as the game wore on - not his best game though.

1052~~~
Was it anyones? Not sure I would be great in the freezing cold at around midnight.

1053~~~
that's obviously BS, he was our best player today, set up the goal well, linked and broke up the play when needed. Deinitely should start every other game , he's our most important player..

1054~~~
I thought he was one of very few poitives tonight

1055~~~
He was.

1056~~~
Agreed. How anyone can complain about his performance tonight I really don't understand....

1057~~~
People who don't understand or know to watch how intelligent footballers move and need others to move in order to do damage with passes will complain.

1058~~~
Problem is everyone is looking at the Everton game. This is a different game, different circumstances and against different players. On a pitch that likely not up to PL standard, in the freezing cold and at a weird time. I still don't get why it wasn't a teatime kickoff.

1059~~~
Did very well for the goal and a couple of nice moments but feck me, he was very negative for a 10. As Scholes said, his first inclination was always to go backwards. Watching him and Mata do the same, though, you start to wonder if they're just following instructions.

1060~~~
Ander needs people to move for him. Martial and Lingard tried but Rooney isn't pulling up trees.

1061~~~
Yeah, the re-shuffle suited him. Until then, he was really struggling to influence the game. First half performance was crap really.

1062~~~
They must be because that just isn't their natural game.

1063~~~
Well when he first joined he was passing forwards and being positive and then he got benched, so you would think it's Van Gaal's orders.

1064~~~
We also stayed too wide today. Nobody in the centre trying to drag their defensive line out of shape. So naturally people would accuse him of being negative or having little impact.

1065~~~
That's the job of a number 10 too.

1066~~~
I'm not saying it isn't. And Ander was dropping in and out of pockets of space demanding for the ball many times if you could rewind and watch the first half again. He was constantly on the move.

1067~~~
It's awkward when one minute we have a 2nd striker No. 10, then an attacking midfielder No.10. He was likely constantly on the move to keep warm. I like Ander running from deep into the box.

1068~~~
Whether by accident or design, he wasn't playing the #10 role tonight. He and Bastian/Fellaini were working opposite sides of the pitch. Lingard would then drift into the centre. 

His was a lot more central against Everton, I thought.

1069~~~
Christ no, that would be a cruel and unusual punishment. 

Yes, he dropped in and out of space but he never made any killer passes, give and goes, shots on goal, or posed any kind of attacking threat. He also gave the ball away a lot more than he did against Everton. 

The whole team was shite in the first half but you'd have to be incredibly biased to not see that Hererra was ineffectual too.

1070~~~
He was a 10 in the first half, ahead of BFS and Schneiderlin. When Fellaini came on we changed formation to 433 with Morgan anchoring midfield and Fellaini/Hererra further forward. Hererra was much better in that new role.

1071~~~
It's kinda hard to do that when we were happy to piss around in the middle of the park. Put yourself in his shoes. If you've ever played as a midfielder in football you'd know how hard it is when nobody on your team wants to make any runs behind the defence, or when that same defence sits so deep and all your team mates are happy to do is knock it side to side in slow ponderous fashion. 

I am most certainly not disputing that he was ineffective but you have to see why he was unable to make an impact.

1072~~~
Not surprising as he isn't really a #10. Might be our best option there right now but that's not quite the same thing.

1073~~~
He had the highest passing accuracy in the team and only Schneiderlin had more passes in general, all while being our most creative player, playing great pass for our goal and creating clear goal chance for Rooney.

Also he wasn't really a number 10, he mostly played on the right side of midfield with our other midfielder playing more to the left.

You are incredibly harsh on him.

1074~~~
Pretty bad tonight, didn't link the midfield with attack well. Didn't really have any aggression either, he can turn his defender so well and does nothing with that opportunity.

1075~~~
That paragraph you quoted was about the first half. Everything in bold happened after half-time.

1076~~~
My bad then, but even in first half he was one of our best players and definitely last one who deserves criticism.

1077~~~
See, I think the midfield, in part due to our unusual amount of possession, was more or less operating the same way in both halves. Schweinsteiger would often be picking up similar pockets of space to Herrera over on the left side, with Herrera working with Valencia and Lingard down the right. Neither of them had any real joy, it must be said.

The positional differences were marginal if at all. I certainly don't think this performance was like your traditional #10, but then I don't think that will ever be the case with Herrera.

1078~~~
We'll agree to disagree. I saw a very clear change in formation when Fellaini came on.

1079~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> boggles my mind that people can say stuff like that.

1080~~~
Cool

1081~~~
I agree there was a clear positional change but even saying that he was the last one who deserves any real criticism he created our best 2 chances of the match.

1082~~~
He had a good game. Always available for the pass, reads the game well further forward and brings a calmness to the side.

Quite a few times the ball was fired into him following a press and he controlled it got away from his marker and ensured we kept possession. 

Invaluable qualities in this system.

1083~~~
I thought he was solid. Nothing more, nothing less.

1084~~~
He needs to play in every game, he's a player that can make things happen. In the final third he knows how to make that killer pass, more so than any other player. And he's good for a few goals.

1085~~~
For sure there was a formation change. He and Fellaini played as 8's in the second half which I think is his best position.

1086~~~
No he wasn't, all he did 90 odd percent of the time was pass it side ways, backwards and to the wing. No forward through balls or penetration and he completely lacked any goal threat.

1087~~~
I think you need to learn the intricacies of playing in midfield. He was extremely effective in speeding up our tempo. Was very aware of what was going on so he rarely dawdled on the ball. Was always showing for the ball and was directing people to keep moving and not be so static. 

Too much sideway passing? Generally happens when the team decides to stay wide and not try to play through the middle. And before you start saying that it's his job to do so, it's the job of the entire team to offer off the ball movement. He can't be expected to do everything on his own.

No penetration? It was him who set us up with our two clearest chances and played an important part in the equaliser.

1088~~~
I don't need to learn the intricacies of midfield, don't insult my intelligence. He did nothing for most of the game.

1089~~~
Well he saw a lot of space on the right so he passed it to Valencia/Lingard a lot, if we had more functioning right wing he would've been much more effective. Pretty average game overall, I think CSKA were good defensively and very compact. We could only hurt them from the wide.

1090~~~
Except create our two best chances and be our most influential creator?

1091~~~
You are going to blame Herrera for Rooney being shit.

Herrera showed only a few days ago against Everton, that if Rooney moved his ass, he'll find him.

1092~~~
Was fantastic tonight I thought apart form 2 sloppy passes in the first half. He knitted the midfield together really nicely, found space very well and supplied the wings with plenty. On the odd occasion Rooney managed to lift his knees high enough to make movement in the box he generally found him, the cross for his header was particularly nice. 

He should definitely keep the 10 role, with martial ahead of him they could make a nice pair.

1093~~~
I've got to agree, Rooneys movement was appalling at times. Rooted to the spot when he should have been busting a gut to get in behind or drag a CB out towards the channels.

1094~~~
sorry if you couldn't see what he does and provides you obviously have a big lack of football knowledge. I think it's pretty obvious. Rooney didn't provide any runs for him to make a pass nor he was able to control ANY balls played from deep. Also CSKA were very organized so once the ball was played to Herrera all the spaces were closed down quickly, and he's great on turn.

You could see the difference between the game against Evrton and today's match. Herrera quickly released Rooney who was in a good position and scored, although it was after a big Jagielka's mistake, he found so many other creative passes and also scored as the opposition pressed high and there was space where to run. Tonight he couldn't find anyone because everything was too tight. CSKA didn't press like mad like Everton. Anyway we controlled the ball fantastically well thanks to Schneiderlin and Herrera and passed it around not in a bad tempo, but we lacked at least decent striker who could make runs , proper leftback who could support Martial. The right side played quite well and the result was our scored a goal. Herrera the main creator.

If he has one key pass which leads to goal in every game than he will be a massive player. We just need other players to up their game and get rid of deadwood (Rooney) because we play with ten men and we can win these games in even a better fashion than we did under Fergie, all those 1:0 away wins, after, boring performances, but we had higher quality players (or more in terms of numbers) in the final third. We missed Shaw and good striker and we could win it. Herrera was one of our best players

1095~~~
Yeah. He got out of some tight spaces a few times. Played well, but not brilliantly. 7/10 type thing.

1096~~~
Herrera was one of the only players in that first half that looked comfortable on the ball. Kept the ball really well in tight areas, unfortunately no one around him could take any advantage of the space that created. Rooney was too static, and Lingard didn't do enough when he got the ball. Add to that the lack of full-back overlap and Martial's initial struggles, there really wasn't anything for him to aim at.

1097~~~
Thank you

1098~~~
Well if he had tried to force the issue and play forward balls to static Wayne I bet you'd be giving him stick for unnecessary loss of possession, all creative players are dependent on the players they create for to look effective - if Valencia had fecked up that cross or if Martial had not scored the oerception would have been that he's done nothing in the match.

1099~~~
Well you clearly have no idea how things are conducted in midfield.

1100~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Mitched it.

1101~~~
Grew into the game, aside from one or two iffy first touches and a couple of misplaced passes he also failed to get his head up on a couple of occasions which I think Mitch is probably referring too only in his own way.

Neither of the 3 behind Rooney were helped by his lack of movement however. I like him (Rooney) but he has too start getting his head out of his arse.

1102~~~

Interesting article.

1103~~~
The article illustrates his situation pretty well. It was said already a lot of times on here, but he sacrifices his instincts and risks to stay in the team. I dont know how many times he just passed it back yesterday in a decent position, without even looking if there was someone available/willing to try something.

1104~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1105~~~
Thought he was fantastic in the second half, exactly what I'd like to see from a #6, alongside Morgan it was a balanced midfield. Now all we need is Mata to be thrown in at #10 and we'd have it all.

1106~~~
Been pretty quiet this half, although to be fair their we're mostly bypassing his zone and look for the space on the wings. They're too compact in the middle. I don't think this is his kind of game, but we'll see. He's usually better in the second half.

1107~~~
You could say he needs more movement in front of him but I'm tired of the "blame others" excuses for Rooney so I'm not cutting him that slack either, needed to do more offensively but was strong and held it up well.

1108~~~
Wasnt his best but very tight space and little actual movement in front of him. Had a half chance I'm surprised he didnt do better. But love having him in there anyway.

1109~~~
As someone said with Smalling and Jones, then Schmidfield and Ander you don't need Rooney. I bet he would have loved Martial in there. With Rooney fluffing every pass forward to him, eventually you give up and sideways and backwards are the only options. Mata wasn't a great help today.

1110~~~
His touch is second best only to Mata. He came better in the second half when he dropped deeper. There was no space in between Fernanduo, Kompany, Otamendi these four could bully anyone.. anyway no movement ahead of him is the biggest issue for sure.

1111~~~
He was quiet today but still did alright, with Mata having an off day and Rooney playing like he always does it was always going to be tough for him to create much.

1112~~~
The two populists didn't do very much.

1113~~~
Neither did the unpopulist, in fact even less so.

1114~~~
Okay?

1115~~~
Mata did not play well, neither did Rooney, Also Fernandhino and City's CB played well. Ander did OK. He was not awful like The Untouchable upfront. If Martial had been in the centre I think we would likely have won.

1116~~~
He and Mata need runners ahead of them. Martial as the #9 making runs would be much better than Rooney standing marked for 90 minutes. But everyone has said that a million times. Not sure how we are to create chances if nobody makes runs. We put some great crosses into the box but nobody goes for them. Herrera was at fault for one of those, as he was at the back post, but it just floated through everyone.

I'd still rather he starts as a #10 than anyone else, but there's just so little movement for anyone to create something.

1117~~~
Its very difficult to do well as part of our front four when Rooney is leading it (unless you are superman or Martial). He did okay in midfield.

1118~~~
I agree, I don't think Ander and Mata played well, I thought Rooney played bad also. And it's impossible to tell, we also could of won today if Lingard's flick was a few MM lower, Smalling's shot a little harder etc.

1119~~~
Mata was definitely worse. He isn't great against side with a lot of physical players. He's been off for a few games now. Remember he was taken off against Everton.

1120~~~
I'm not quite sure the no movement argument fully absolves Herrera, I'd much rather see him try some through balls and then to blame Rooney if he's not in the right place rather than just use Rooney's mediocrity used as a blanket excuse.

1121~~~
I didn't think he was bad at all not compared to Mata anyway. I hope van Gaal sticks with him in the starting line up.

1122~~~
He was better than Mata and much better than Rooney, but a fairly meh performance from him.

1123~~~
Thought he played well and helped dominate the game. There wasn't much space in the middle though with City playing so many defensive players and defensive mids. Both him and Mata (and any attacking mid) needs a striker who makes runs in behind to stretch teams. Martial up front does that and Mata was at his best in those games Martial was up top. Rooney just doesn't do that.

1124~~~
lol I know you're joking but the way things have been, we would see Herrera dropped from the squad for a 3rd time after getting himself back into it. 

There's no way he would/could force a pass because LVG would tell the media it was poor decision making and obviously no one would blame Rooney for sh|t.

1125~~~
To be fair when Mata has games like that most of the Caf want him out the team.

Anyway about today.. I thought Herrera played a blinding pass through to Sterling. Did ok apart from that.

1126~~~
I really want to see him get a good run in the team with Martial leading the line.

I think Ander has an affinity with fans. Other interviews have shown he has supported fans when they have had issues with their clubs in Spain. I am not sure some players feel that way. Some can be rather detached.

1129~~~
Yes Ander <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1130~~~
What a top bloke.

1131~~~
Fantastic guy. He loves the club and I'm pretty sure there's not a Manchester United fan who doesn't love him. Great signing in every possible way.

1132~~~
Will he ever play CM again? He could potentially be our long-term partner for Schneiderlin.

1133~~~
He's been one of the worst players on the pitch today, in my opinion.

1134~~~
His last 3 games has been as bad as Rooneys at no 10 this year.
Will it kill us to play Mata there?

1135~~~
2nd worst on the pitch today just behind Darmian.

1136~~~
When did he stop turning and running forward?  That was the best thing about him,  controlling the ball in midfield quick turn and he's off.

1137~~~
Poor performance, should've been taken off instead of Mata in my opinion.

1138~~~
He was terrible. Probably played more back passes today than he has done in his whole career.

1139~~~
I don't think he has enough guile or goal threat to play as a #10, especially in tough, tight games, disappointing from him today.

1140~~~
Mata was poor as well, not to mention he was providing no help for our RB. Too many players were poor today, but we can only make 3 substitutions.

1141~~~
Quite simple, once he fully understood the philosophy.

1142~~~
Sadly, he was really, really bad today.  Don't think he has what it takes to be in that role.  Nice guy and all that, but when you can't beat a man with a dribble you don't offer enough in the modern game where teams are so fit and organized.

1143~~~
Mata would've been moved to the middle anyways. Mata was still better than Herrera, albeit not great either.

1144~~~
While Wayne is in the side, we will always have the problem of other players being shunted all over the place. Wayne should have been dropped. Young wide and Martial up front. Not a great performance today. This manager is sucking all the life out of our team. They are terrified of taking a risk. He says they can, but they can't really.

1145~~~
Yeah he was bad today. He'll get dropped after one bad game too, and Rooney will still start.

Sorry for bringing Rooney into another thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1146~~~
Probably will. He hasn't been great tbh. Rooney has been bad all season. This dressing room is going to fracture soon if the manager isn't careful. BFS and Mata must be getting fed up being substituted all the time.

1147~~~
Not lived up to his billing in the past few games, seems to have gone in to his shell and become a little sloppy.

1148~~~
Unfortunately that's exactly the truth. 

Players like Herrera are terrified of taking risks because they know they'll get relegated to the bench if they do.

1149~~~
This. Post of the year.

1150~~~
He's a better than average playmaker but nowhere close to the likes of Lampard, Gerrard or Scholes.  And that is the quality standard we should aspire for as United fans.

He is massively over hyped on here.  Personally I don't get the love fest.

1151~~~
Funny, he is playing probably his worst football since he came here and yet he is starting games and playing 90 minutes. When he was all creative and scoring goals he was regulary dropped.

1152~~~
Don't get the hype either he must be decent on Fifa of FM or something.

Looks decent at times but lots of games where he doesn't stand out at all. Very very poor today and needs to cut out the diving soon as he gets tackled inside the box before he builds a reputation.

1153~~~
Some of the hype is over the top but I think many are fond of him due to the dynamic and progressive nature of his play which made a big impression on fans after years of a slow and quite static set up.
He isn't a #10 in my book and looked much more comfortable in our midfield last season, I am fond of him but you can't really defend his recent form. We are quickly running out of people to drop though and when we have played well (during the entire LVG era) he has generally been involved and impressed.

1154~~~
I would hope he gets paired with Morgan in a midfield two on Tuesday and next weekend. The selling of all those strikers in the summer and not replacing them is impacting on this side. Rooney is running the club by the look of it. Amazingly the manager doesn't know Martial's best position, absolutely unbelievable.

1155~~~
I hate this



He never says such things for someone like Rooney for example. If you are going to do something, at least be consistent with all the players.

1156~~~
He's right, but that is disgusting. He is picking on the easy targets. I bet he does that in the dressing room as well. Darmian will have been ripped to pieces. Yet Wayne gets away with it.

1157~~~
He's an idiot alright.

1158~~~
"I asked Martial why he overhit that pass for our beloved Wayne and he couldn't answer why. Probably because he doesn't speak English. So we in club agreed to give Wayne bonus for this week."

1159~~~
What chance is he talking about ??

1160~~~
Quit bullying easy targets like Ander. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

PS: He hasn't been great lately though. In a bit of a rut, much like Darmian. In the red zone perhaps?

1161~~~
Someone said a ball came through a lot of legs and Ander got himself in a knot. Wayne's was a similar chance to the Everton goal and he got nowhere near it. A decent striker would have scored.

1162~~~
Matteo was great early on and his form has dipped. He's a bully is our Louis. Maybe they are fed up with the tactics and certain players getting a free pass.

1163~~~
The one where Martial plays a pass across the box and Herrera misses his shot. Around the penalty spot.

1164~~~
That's fine he should have scored, but to call him out on it and not on Wayne being unable to get on the end of stuff is not great. As I said he is going to split that dressing room.

1165~~~
Thanks, I remember now.

He slipped and missed the chance, so no idea why he is pointing that out in the press, the answer is obvious. Talk about that in private ffs. 

Not to mention, if he is going to call players for missing chances, then how come he never mentions the chances that Rooney messes up.

1166~~~
I didn't say I agree with van Gaal. Herrera mis-kick is something that can happen. Nonetheless IMO Herrera has mostly been below his standard this season, but the treatment he's receiving from van Gaal in public ever since van Gaal arrived at the club is absolutely bizarre. Don't think any other player gets called out as often and it's the manager who can't make the best use of him.

1167~~~
When he couldn't work out what to do with ADM, doesn't know what Martials best position is. Are you completely surprised.

1168~~~
LVG just mentioned Herrera since he had a chance. I don't think there's much else to it. Not like he can say...
"In the game, Wayne Rooney could have done something but he didn't. I asked him and he didn't know why."

1169~~~
No, not really, if you put it like that. Moyes was criticised for calling out the players and not taking responsibility for bad performances, the same currently applies to van Gaal in my eyes.

1170~~~
I think to get the best out of a player like Ander Herrera you need movement around him. No good expecting him to pick the ball up and beat players since that isn't his game and he can only play incisive passes if the players in front of him are pulling defenders out of position

I think it might be time to bring Depay back into the side now, OK he has been hit and miss but he tries things, we have too many safe players

1171~~~
He was complete dogshit today, capping off a dodgy run of games.

Was very surprised not to see him hooked after an hour. 

If I were LvG I'd be tempted to drop him and give Pereira a game or two in that position.

But yeah, something something something, Rooney.

1172~~~
Seriously doubt its LvG telling him to miss place passes. At one point today, from a throw in he just hoofed it blindly overhear into the centre of the park, straight to a palace player. 

He needs to pull his head of his hole, maybe thats why LvG comments on him, he may need to be managed slightly differently, maybe.

1173~~~
Herrera must (not always) start.

1174~~~
Hasn't played well in the last three or so matches but LVG calling him out like that is fecking uncalled for especially when he is too scared to do anything about our worst player. You can't be inconsistent like that and expect to retain the respect and loyalty of your players. Herrera has a few flaws to his game that stop him from being a world class player but the player we see this year has been completely bullied into submission and all the things that made him such an exciting player at the start of last season have been coached out. Same thing with Mata and Rooney.

1175~~~
You think the first touch has been coached out of Rooney?

Mata scored 18 goals in 82 games for Chelsea, he has scored 18 in like 50 games for us. So he has actually improved with us.

1176~~~
In the very post you quoted I said that Herrera has been below his standard, which he has been for most of his time at United. He hasn't consistently been as good as he was at Athletic and a good part of that is down to van Gaal and his philosophy.

1177~~~
He was shite today because of his technical ability, it had nothing to do with philosophy or anything else.

1178~~~
Mata passes it out to Martial who crossed it to Herrera who fluffed it. Didn't manage to angle his body correctly for the shot it seemed.

1179~~~
I think though, that you can probably say the same about Herrera, Mata and Rooney. If you had just one of the three, and substituted in 2 of the likes of Martial as well as the young man himself, we'd be altogether more vibrant

1180~~~
Basically like the rest of the team for several games then, which is a total coincidence. He wasn't the only player, who gave the ball away in stupid areas.

1181~~~
Rooney's problems go much deeper than simply having stuff coached out of him, I'll grant you that. Mata has the 'stats' but comparing his influence in this United side against what he did with Chelsea you'll see that he is now less influential as a creative force.

1182~~~
I never said he was, the entire team was shite today, but this thread is about Herrera's performance, he was shite today, and would've been shite regardless of philosophy, unless the philosophy was to play pointless passes really badly.

1183~~~
Ridiculous for him to target like that.

1184~~~
That's what I don't agree with. He completed 93% of his passes today, best completion rate with Schweinsteiger. Surely that's in line with the philosophy. Obviously plaiying badly isn't, but he isn't the only one failing to show up. Yet he's repeatedly spoken of in public by van Gaal, while others are overlooked, which is the point I'm trying to make. I don't disagree with your assessment of him, but I do disagree with van Gaal being unable to give credit where it's due and at the same time being quick to point the finger.

1185~~~
Wonder if he asked Rooney about the ball through from Martial? No, that would be stupid. Seriously, what kind of answer is he expecting from Herrera there, 'nah gaffer, just didn't feel like scoring yet'

1186~~~
Bar one or two no one deserves any credit for that performance. 

LvG said - ""In the last minute of the first half, Ander Herrera could have finished it but he didn’t. I asked him and he didn’t know why." - I haven't seen it but I'd assume he was probably asked about our chances to win the game, arguably that was our best chance because the ball was to feet and he fecked it up - I don't really see that as pointing the finger and I'd say if you're gonna take that comment as some sort of stinging OTT criticism I'd say you're being a bit precious.

As for not commenting on Rooney, I'd imagine he thinks there has been enough comment on Rooney from the press on him, and the last thing he needs, in the context of trying to get Rooney back into any sort of form, is to give the press more fuel for headlines  - "Van Gaal lays blame for poor performance with Rooney" - as it's hardly going to be productive. 

Aside from anything, fans give far too much credence to what managers say to the press, it's not as if they don't talk to players, and most likely say something completely than they do to the press which is obviously a pain in the arse for them.

1187~~~
That dive was disgraceful. Cut that shit out Ander.

1188~~~
Rooney never has any chances to miss tbf.

1189~~~
Don't want him diving. That isn't good. You wonder if LvG has told him not to do it. SAF had to with our Ashley.

1190~~~
I'm talking in general about giving credit where it's due. He struggles to say or dislikes saying good things about individual performances, when we played well.

It's not criticism, but why has he to single out players, when the whole team is playing badly? We've had 2 chances, Rooney's freekick and Herrera's mis-kick, if I remember it correctly, hardly enough to win the game or score enough goals. On the one hand he's always saying his players are human beings and at the same time they have to be extremely efficient and there's no room for mistakes at all.

Managers definitely say different things to the media than to the players. Players and fans are nonetheless aware, what their managers or coaches say and react to it. Scholes didn't say without reason that one of Ferguson's best traits was how he protects his players. I just don't agree with singling out one player specifically, when team as whole is struggling for a prolonged period of time.

1191~~~
But lots of managers do that, refuse to single out players for praise, team game etc. At the same time, in the midst of such sketchy form, perhaps it's hard to find someone to single out for praise.

But he has singled people out for praise in the past, including Herrera:








And as I say, its not as if he has singled out Herrera and slaughtered him in the press.

1192~~~
Very poor today I thought. He's not really suited to that number 10 role IMO. He plays too safe and doesn't drive forward enough.

1193~~~
Had a bad game. After coming in and being really good it looks like he's lost form really quickly. Wish he'd have buried that chance, probably didn't help his confidence after that.

1194~~~
Should have taken a touch with his chance.

1195~~~
The role he had last season was more suited to him, linking up with Mata and Valencia. I was hoping in the summer that we would build on that 3 man midfield, giving him a more creative partner than Fellaini, but i know that LvG prefers the formation we play now.

1196~~~
Looking at squwaka I find it rather depressing that he's taken 6 shots all season, which is the same number as Skrtel, Kompany and Micah Richards. It's also two shots less than Otamendi whose played 1 game less. He's currently shooting once every 80 minutes played on average.

In contrast, Januzaj took 3 shots in his 2 appearances for us, that totalled 125 minutes.

1197~~~
I can't believe his dive in the penalty area hasn't been mentioned, embarrassing. Delaney wasn't near him.

1198~~~
It was appalling, he needs to cut that shit out I remember him doing something similar against Arsenal in the FA Cup last season. Just goes to show how desperate we are at the moment...

1199~~~
I can't go into a thread without seeing Rooney being mentioned. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, haven't watched our last two games, as I've been on holiday. Not like I missed much by the sounds. Judging by the comments, Ander wasn't great in the Palace game.

I personally still think to get the best out of him, and the whole team, for that matter, we need to go with the system we used at the back end of last season - a 4141, with Ander either being the 8 or the most advanced midfielder (same position Fellaini played).

1200~~~
Played a lot better Wednesday without Herrera as a number 10, really don't think he's the right player for the role and would much prefer him competing for a place in that midfield 2.

1201~~~
Agree but also Mata should be given a chance at #10.

1202~~~
I wouldnt say we looked better because Hererra wasnt the 10, but more so because we played a 442, which seemed to be the right decision by Van Gaal, as Moscow were always going to have 11 men behind the ball. We looked more positive than we've been recently and created some decent chances.

1203~~~
I think his skill set would enable him to be a decent #10 for us, but once he became a full fledged philosopher, his game has suffered tremendously. We need a #10 that is going to create chances for our forward and Herrera hasn't done much more than pass sideways and backwards. When Rooney was at #10 on Tuesday at least he tried to play the ball forward. Herrera hasn't done that recently.

1204~~~
That's definitely a fair point, and I'd much prefer in the majority of games that we went two upfront, especially home games where teams are going to park the bus. I just don't think Mata/Herrera on the same pitch works against these types of teams.

1205~~~
was he injured?

1206~~~
No. Why? Lovely ball for Martial to get the penalty.

1207~~~
Hes better suited to playing as a third midfielder than two in midfield. Makes more sense he didnt start (unless of course Rooney was no starting lolz)

1208~~~
Was glad he got on and contributed to the 2nd goal. He now gets a couple of weeks without playing, so will be fresh. In a way was glad Fellaini wasn't available for us to hoof balls to.

1209~~~
He was dropped because of pretty poor form, I know everyone will say; "Rooney didn't do any better either!" but the main point is that he can't play Herrera and Mata together. They want to occupy the same positions on the field and it turns into a bit of a mess.

1210~~~
Was on his way to having a great game. Looked very sharp and a peach of an assist from him.

So unfortunate, feel we've lost quite a bit in our performance from his injury.

1211~~~
Yeah, he's a very neat player, understands the game so well

1212~~~
Hopefully its just a small strain. Smalling apparently pulled his hammy too for England against France but was back quick enough.

1213~~~
It might have been precautionary, praying it is.

1214~~~
Can't play Herrera and Mata together he says...

1215~~~
It's coming up to Panto season. OH YES WE CAN.

1216~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> - any chance of getting his reaction from the bench when the winner went in?

1217~~~
He was terrible apart from the assist.

1218~~~
Loved that, he was going absolutely mental <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1219~~~
That was lovely.

How can anyone not be a Herrera fanboy?

1220~~~
God I love him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1221~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/iu3Qvgw3w2T/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1222~~~
I love him ! LOVE HIM!

1223~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1224~~~
Nobody else at Man Utd plays quick passes and through balls quite like Herrera. I hope his injury isn't serious.

1225~~~
This is the best one <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Love him!

1226~~~
The fact his reaction was quite so passionate and the fact he was on the bench for the whole of the second half makes me think positively that he's not too badly hurt either.

1227~~~
Love the man & hope his injury isn't too serious.
Giggsy's celebration was a bit muted though, right?

1228~~~
Yeah, if he's jumping about so wildly it can't be too big of an injury. Will probably miss the PSV game though.

1229~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1230~~~
He gets it.

1231~~~
Hope it's not serious his quick forward passes are crucial for us, great reaction for the winner too gotta love him

1232~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1233~~~
Fantastic cross fro the Memphis goal. Hopefully his injury is not serious.

1234~~~
I think he's my favourite player now.

1235~~~
That celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Great assist from him, hope that his injury isn't that serious because we're getting short in numbers.

1236~~~
This could be your big chance.

1237~~~
So he celebrated a goal scored by the team he plays for and now half of Manchester is ready to give an arm and a leg to tickle his bum. 

Nice assist anyway.

1238~~~
He is one of the best humans.

1239~~~
one of our most important players.

Tie the lad up to a long contract.

1240~~~
Promise to do my best xx.

1241~~~
You seem really fun.

1242~~~
Have to practice the celebrations as well. Sliding on your knees, trying to demolish a dugout.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1243~~~
Your life must be filled with sadness.

1244~~~
There's alway one who has to piss on your chips isn't there?

1245~~~
he's a very good player. will be missed.

1246~~~
Celebration or not, what kind of human wouldn't want to tickle Herrera's bum.

1247~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1248~~~
Hopefully just a tweak of the hamstring. Knowing our luck it'll be a grade three tear.

1249~~~
Paul Scholes?

1250~~~
Aye, him as well.

1251~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah both Mata and Herrera were sublime again today. Finally Rooney dropped to let these two amazing players not be constrained by the oaf.

We barely won.

1252~~~
To be fair, Mata didn't play well. Ander was probably doing everying Mata should be doing and when he Ander went off, Juan didn't pick up the baton.

There again if he had brought Pereira on instead on Rojo it might have helped.

1253~~~
That's something I can live with.

1254~~~
He seemed to be moving fine during his celebration. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Hopefully it's just a strain and he'll only miss a couple of games.

1255~~~
And that's the issue. Herrera and Mata like to play in the same spaces, it doesn't make sense from a positional standpoint to play them together. The heat maps shows two blobs right next to each other usually.

I like them both, theyre just too similar.

1256~~~
At the moment I would play Herrera, except he is injured. Mata looks jaded but looks like he will have to play.

1257~~~
Ander is love 

Ander is life

1258~~~
Ando is large.

1259~~~
I hope we tie him to a long contract....before Real turn his head.

1260~~~
Fans enjoying seeing passion from their players. Shocking stuff.

1261~~~
He's a Basque, not likely.

1262~~~
There are better players at Real as well.

1263~~~
Isco and James Rodriguez are much better players. He wouldn't get near their team.

Thought he played well saturday and we suffered greatly when he went off. Hopefully he'll be back soon. I like a midfield of him and schmidfield.

1264~~~
Xabi Alonso and Aitor Karanka are also Basque and they played for Real Madrid.

1265~~~
Okay, point taken <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1266~~~
Is there any news on his injury?

1267~~~
No yet but he didn't train.

1268~~~
Even a minor hamstring injury should keep him out more than a couple of days.

1269~~~
He is an irreplaceable player for our squad this season, along with Martial and De Gea, even if Van Gaal doesn't see it. We are so slow and turgid in the middle without him and he can take minutes away that Rooney, Fellaini and even Schweinsteiger (who is playing way too many and often) shouldn't be playing.

1270~~~
What I like about Ander is that he is always on the move, trying to make runs. It is then up to someone to pick him out. The Liverpool game is a good example of that. He didn't have a great game, but made the run and Michael Carrick picked him out with a peach of a ball resulting in a penalty. Last night everyone was too static. There has to be movement. The players are there and are better than they are showing. It said something when we resorted to bringing on Fellaini and Young. Then leaving Mata until 6-7 minutes from the end, what was the point of that.

1271~~~
Is he (and maybe Martial) the only player who shows some off the ball movement and that brings some urgency in our play...

1272~~~
Yes, but even they get brainwashed into playing statues sometimes. Just let the players go out and enjoy doing their job. I am not sure they are at this minute.

1273~~~
They certainly are not. We've been too static since LVG took over and tonight it showed once more that it's a huge weakness. No wonder did LVG not start Herrera since he's always on the move

1274~~~
We miss Herrera's dynamism and quick passing when he's absent. Against Everton his quick through ball released Rooney, against West Brom he plays a quick through ball Martial runs onto it and we get a penalty. Last night, especially in the first half, we were crying out for that quick through ball and nobody was playing it. Herrera may not be the best midfielder in the world, but he's the best we've got at a) spotting the run and b) playing the defence splitting pass. When you see how Rooney or Fellaini play at number 10 its impossible not to notice the massive difference when Herrera's there.

1275~~~
I wish he would leave for the sake of his career. He is being completely wasted here. I can understand not playing him if the team were firing on all cylinders without him in it but we're not.

1276~~~
He's injured, I think he might have played last night. I actually don't think Martial was ready. Rooney would have played up front or Memphis like on Saturday. Mata is out of form, maybe due to tiredness. The injuries forced his hand last night.

1277~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/623267/Manchester-United-Ander-Herrera-Louis-van-Gaal-talks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/623267/Manchester-United-Ander-Herrera-Louis-van-Gaal-talks</a>

1278~~~
I feel for the lad. For me he is our best midfielder and would be one of the first names on the teamsheet. He has his off days, but who doesn't?

Will be gutted ifnwe lose him in the summer.

1279~~~
Such lazy/shite journalism to not even realise he was injured.

1280~~~
What a brilliantly written crap story. Its truly inception-esque. The express has an article quoting reports and then quotes the Daily Star in the next paragraph. Its rubbish within rubbish

1281~~~
That's why you have doubts about a lot of articles most of the time. Just pot stirring. They have absolutely no idea what is going on at the clubs. They write articles almost under the pretext," If I was Ander I'd be pissed", with absolutely no knowledge as to if he is or not. They do it with all the clubs. Do any of the attacking midfielders/forwards know what their roles are, I doubt it. The DM's do, it just stand there. They know Ander is popular and people will click on the article. If it was some obscure reserve, nobody would care less.

1282~~~
You just have to look at the other stories on the page at that link to see The Express is basically caughtoffside level journalism at this point.

1283~~~
It's not going to stop people getting outraged at Van Gaal for it though.

1284~~~
Don't you think this is a deliberate attempt by the press to provide another stick to beat him with. Yesterday it was the Valdez story, today Herrera, tomorrow somebody else. Some fans are up in arms about how we are playing anyway, so they have ready targets to increase the umbrage.

1285~~~
Any idea how long he's out for? Really want him and Martial to be given a shot as a combination over the next few weeks if Rooney is injured. It's about time Herrera was first choice.

1286~~~
-------Martial--------
Depay-Herrera-Mata

Young/Darmian RB, Rojo/Blind/Darmian/Young LB.

1287~~~

1288~~~
And he's already rubbished that story.

1289~~~
Standard hamstring is about 28 days. Maybe 21 if it was a minor one.

1290~~~
Could you blame him if he wanted to leave? He's at an age when he should be pushing for a national team spot and he has the talent to do it. Plays well whenever given the chance yet finds himself riding the pine for quite possibly one of the worst performers in the league.

1291~~~
fecksake. So Rooney gets injured and the guy who should be starting ahead of him is injured too. What timing for Herrera (and us ).

1292~~~
I predicted that would happen. Didn't you just know that Herrera would be injured the moment Rooney was?!

1293~~~
Herrera's talent will shine through and we will enjoy his flair for years to come......<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1294~~~
Wait what , Rooney injured?? He is still going to play, isnt he

1295~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> one of the few players that give us that movement.

Just look at him here.

This + <span style="font-size: 12px">Gündogan, a couple of wing-forwards, and a less possession-focused manager would be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> They'd just be flicking, dinking, chipping the ball in little triangles all over the park. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
It would be awesome to get players in who can play at his (and Martial's speed) and build on it. 


---------Schneiderlin
------Herrera---Gundogan
Griezmann--Martial--- ?

Throw in Tielemans too, for good measure.</span>

1297~~~
Poor Ander, he came here for champion league and now we're out. How many games did he play ?

1298~~~
Maybe he should step up his performances and help us achieve champions league? Just a thought.....

1299~~~
He did it last season.

1300~~~
I actually think he's done pretty well to adapt when you think of his natural game and the totally contrasting styles of play he was used to under Bielsa. That's the player we paid the money for. LVG has told him to do literally the opposite of what I would like to see him (and our team) do. 

We're not forcing teams into mistakes. Our none existent movement off the ball creates no space for anybody to play in and we're left waiting for a massive brain fart from an opposition player.

1301~~~
<b>
</b>
That is a fabulous point. The Ander Herrera who played against United, the one SAF was scouting, the one he told Moyes to sign. That is the kind of player this team needs. LvG is an idiot.

1302~~~
Is he capable of fixing this mess?

surely Carrick and Herrera partnership we will create more chances.

1303~~~
What an absolutely terrible time to get injured for a player who is still trying to establish himself in the team. This would have been a perfect opportunity for him to nail a spot in the team.

1304~~~
When he is fit he will get back in. There is nobody deserving of keeping him out.

1305~~~
When's he due back? Everything's gone to shit without him.

1306~~~
Let's have it right, it's clear the manager doesn't fancy him and he takes the view that he's only as good as his last performance. Where others are given the benefit of the doubt if they have a bad game, he's often on the bench the following game. Herrera is everything that represents a Utd player so it doesn't surprise me that LVG can't see that....

1307~~~
Can we please play him as one of our 2 deep lying players? Playing 2 of Schweinsteiger/Schneiderlin/Carrick is too defensive IMO. Playing one of the 3 alongside Herrera would be better I say. Herrera can at least use his energy and passing ability to bring the ball forward and link up with our attack. Also has more goals in him than the other midfielders we have.

1308~~~
Well, we could. But it would appear he's not allowed to do those things. Last time he played in that role was away in Brugge I think and he had a stinking 45 minutes until we moved him slightly further forward

1309~~~
That certainly <i>was </i>the case.

But prior to this latest injury he started 5 of the previous 7 and came on as a sub in the other two.  So I'm a little optimistic that LVG may be warming to him.

1310~~~
He had good position last season(1 defensive midfielder with two ahead of him - one of them was Herrera) which actually fits lot of our players and made them play good stuff but by the looks of it Louie changed that because it made lot of sense.

1311~~~
Have no idea why we do not try a 4-3-3 again! With Carrick/Basti being our deepest midfielder and Schneiderlin and Herrera just ahead could work wonders. 

Front 3 would be Martial furthest up top, Memphis/Young/Lingard on the left and Mata/Young/Lingard on the right

1312~~~
Wasn't that his first appearance this season though?

1313~~~
We were playing decent football and getting results. Hateful stuff. Hope i
This never happens again.

1314~~~
This. But I'd have Schneiderlin as the deepest - Since that's his job - and Herrera + either Carrick/Schweinsteiger just in front. No coincidence that our best football under LvG was when we played 4-3-3 and we had a holding player and two Box to Box players assisting both the attack and defence.

It should be even more effective now in that we actually have a specialist CDM in Schneiderlin. Freeing up Carrick/Schweini to concentrate on feeding the forwards and Herrera to join the forwards in attack.

1315~~~
Yeah I guess you're right. I was thinking Schneiderlin a bit further up so he can use his energy to get into the box, even though he needs to improve his attacking aspect of the game. Playing a bit higher up would allow him to use his energy to press higher up the pitch, which Carrick/Basti would not do as well IMO.

However, since Carrick and Basti are better passes than Schneiderlin, they should create more chances for our forwards with pinpoint passes.

1316~~~
He does like a bribe.

I would like to see this given a go, think we need to keep the energy of Schneiderlin and also the discipline - it allows Carrick a bit more freedom. Herrera playing in his favourite position as the attacking midfielder of a 3 man midfield..

--------------DDG----------------
Darmian--Smalling--Jones--Blind
--------Carrick---Schneiderlin---
------------Herrera--------------
Lingard--Martial----Memphis

1317~~~
Agreed.

This formation also gets the best out of Fellaini if he needs to play, giving him that free #8 role which doesn't result in him abandoning the midfield and leaving us wide open, nor does it result in longball target man play. Basti could also play a role there as he likes to get forward and attack, he's not the type to sit and control.

Those triangles out wide that we had between Blind, Young and Fellaini on the left and Valencia, Mata and Herrera on the right would also benefit Memphis, give him support and allow him to make runs into the box and down the line rather than expecting him to do it all on his own. It could hopefully bring back Mata's best form too, as he needs support and runners around him.

Our squad looks incredibly suited to that style of 4-3-3 that we got a lot of joy from in the 2nd half of last season, Especially now we have Schneiderlin to play at the base of it, and Blind to step out from the back four and hit those delicious direct passes. Even in the games we didn't win and struggled a bit playing 4-3-3, it still looked like the approach that best suited our players, and it looked like we were moving towards something positive. Why did we abandon it?

1318~~~
Giggs and the "united way" IMO. I think LVG saw how City and liverpool played fairly gung-ho styles and did well, and he's tried to recreate it. Problem is though we lack the players and LVG doesn't truly believe in this way of playing.

1319~~~
It's a good point actually. I forgot about Fellaini but he was as vital to that system as anyone last season. He gave us a quick out ball from defence to build attacks from. It was a good blend between passing football and direct football. I miss it <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1320~~~
Definitely. I would rather go back to a 4-3-3 with Fellaini in the squad than the 4-2-3-1 it seems that we are playing now without Fellaini.

1321~~~
I dont think it has to do with Giggs. We went out and bought 2 midfielders to play the formation with 2 DMs, something van Gaal played at Bayern with Van Bommel and Schweini. I just think Louis doesnt like being so open, so changed it.

1322~~~

Praise the lord.

1323~~~
Thank feck for that!

1324~~~
Back to save our season for the second time.

1325~~~
Herrera is the top gear of the United engine, if you wanna score, you want Herrera.

1326~~~
Rooney is back also. He will not play.

1327~~~
YES!!!!

feck sake

1328~~~
Hope we can get a good 10 games out of him now. Needs to get a good run.

1329~~~
In Ander I trust.

1330~~~
The lad will disappoint you all, he can't turn it all around by himself....if he even plays <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1331~~~
Hmm...Back to the game of where can we hide Rooney to least negative effect? 

If we stick him out left we lose Memphis, who is one of our few players who can beat a man and score a solo goal. 

If we stick him up top we screw the whole attack. 

In midfield he keeps Herrera out.

1332~~~
shit hair

1333~~~
We missed him so much. Everyone has been shit without him.

1334~~~
We need him on the field whenever he is fit.

1335~~~
Looked off the pace, as you'd expect. Should have started, so he could have felt his way in to the game whilst we were on top. Didn't expect him to save the game for us, but he did okay. Needs to start always.

1336~~~
I don't think he had any impact at all today.

1337~~~
Body language expert here. 

There was a few times where Norwich broke and sure you'll have to take into account he was probably winded/rusty but he didn't make much of an effort to bust a gut to track back/with any intent. 

This the Herrera, who always gives it his all even when he has to come on for a minute after being frozen out for several games etc.

Very telling LVG has even lost Herrera's prforessionalism and enthusiasm. He even cut his cut ffs! That says it all.

1338~~~
Looked a bit off but he should be one of the first names on the team sheet. Just so much more talented then Fellaini and actually attack minded compared to the other midfielders

1339~~~
I'm not one of his biggest fans but deserves a run of games

1340~~~
What he did today shows what weve been lacking all season when he hasn't played as a CM. I'm not even going to go there with Fellaini, I'm just going to come out with it and say it, we didn't need to buy Bastian, Herrera is that player we need. He kept us ticking over, kept the ball moving, opening up pockets of space, making us less predictable and Carrick also improved his game when he came on. The difference between him and Fellaini is universes apart, Fellaini just runs into the box and we end up hoofing it to him, where as Herrera supports Carrick and is always there for a pass or pick up the ball out side the box. This is the player that should be one of the first on the team sheet along with De Gea, Smalling and Martial.

1341~~~
Some people seem to see only what they want to see, I thought it was very visible today that he's  been out for a while and it seemed like he was lacking both in match tempo and fitness. He should definitely be a starter for us when fit but today it was the right call to start him on the bench.

1342~~~
He was pretty anonymous. Lacked match fitness though so it can be excused.

1343~~~
Nope, it's the same type of thing Fellaini gets murdered for, it's clear instructions from the manager to stay up front most of the time, we're virtually playing with 1 defensive midfielder in Carrick, it's a 4-1-3-2 of some sort.

1344~~~
He did nothing. No need to hype his performance.

Saying that he does deserve more chances to play with Carrick.

1345~~~
I will put yesterday down to rustiness. He needs a run in the team not a sub appearance or game here and there. Even Jamie Jackson and Micky Quinn were saying he should be in the side. So should Morgan. He hit on a good formula last season and lo and behold ditched it this season. A midfield 3 and let BFS rotate. No Fellaini unless we are absolutely desperate and mainly no bloody Rooney. The formation last season brought the best out of Mata as well and they actually looked like they were enjoying themselves. We can't have that can we Louis.

1346~~~
Must start today, we need a player who's going to break down their defence with a cutting pass. He's the most likely of our players to do that.

1347~~~
I agree. Criminally underused this season

1348~~~
He's not helping himself getting back into squad playing like this.

1349~~~
Shit first half showing. We really have made him out to be this saviour he isnt.

1350~~~
Why is he playing so deep?

1351~~~
Yep.

1352~~~
He should be playing further forward not the defensive pair along with Carrick. It's obvious this is not his best position, Van Gaal playing a player out of position and you expect him to play a blinder typical <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1353~~~
The truth is the difference between all the midfielders at United is not that great, they all have flaws and are not close to world class. So whoever you play is a gamble.

1354~~~
At least he's showing some passion, all the others have stopped playing for this club.

1355~~~
He's the only one showing some character and trying things on the ball. Martial too.. everyone else has been shocking.

1356~~~
He'd expect him to complete some passes.

1357~~~
He's shit like everybody else, then you've got people who are even worse. Bored of players who are just trying, we've got enough of those. Captain is coming on to show us that he's trying as well.

1358~~~
he misplaced some passes but apart that he's our best player and at least looks like he's trying. Carrick on the other hand is still on vacation. Herrera is the last player to critisize..

1359~~~
He's been poor 

But everytime he passes forward Fellaini, mata, martial and Memphis are fecking it up with a shite first touch

1360~~~
Playing shite but who isn't? Pretty clear the players aren't the real problem here.

1361~~~
We're in a bad period as a team but that does not mean that we should be blind to players who still have what it takes to make it here. Herrera is absolutely one of those players. He is asking for the ball, making himself available and showing some character.. in a better side, he is definitely worth keeping. Its the likes of Mata and Carrick who have no future here.

Someone like Memphis is also perilously close to getting shipped out as well, I like the lad but in terms of his performances he has been absolutely dire.. barely a smidgen better than Rooney.

1362~~~
Exactly, none of them are getting into decent positions to receive the ball and when Herrera slots the passes through.. they get bundled over - making him look bad.

1363~~~
So it's everybody's fault but his eh?

Rooney mk 2.0 that is.

1364~~~
He's played shit, why does everyone on here make excuses for him?

1365~~~
Im a big fan of his but he's been absolutely terrible today, he's made Smalling look like a good passer.

1366~~~
Quick sand for him today. Gone from bad, to worse, to shit.

Like most today. At least he's been visible though.

1367~~~
Ander was shocking today.  I'd still take a bad Ander though 7/10.

1368~~~
Terrible performance from him. Our best player today.

1369~~~
Been awful, but at least he tried. Were Carrick or Mata playing. Be interesting how this team play with a different manager. He should have played instead of Fellaini.

1370~~~
He was bad. As bad as the others really.

1371~~~
Lol'd

Definitely his worst performance here by a long way..

1372~~~
Doesn't really help assure of his place in the team with this performance

1373~~~
He was poor.

1374~~~
Shite second half. He looked like he was deliberately trying to give the ball away it was that bad.

1375~~~
Wouldnt surprise me to be fair

1376~~~
Count track of the number of times he had to drop between defenders to collect and distribute the ball. Neither Smalling nor Jones can pass for shit  and Carrick went into his shell. Took on two jobs and ended up doing neither well.

1377~~~
Wasn't great.

Still have faith with the right manager in the right system he could still be the midfielder we are looking for.

1378~~~
Woeful passing. Expect him dropped on Monday

1379~~~
It should have been Morgan in and him at 10. If LvG was thinking about the Chelsea game, I hope he is sacked before then.

1380~~~
Hoping we have a different manager by then. I would put LvG and the rest of us out of our misery.

1381~~~
Played with the same kind of useless aggression as Rooney and Was awful on the ball today.

1382~~~
poor, but they all where.

1383~~~
His worst game for united, genuinely woeful today and I love him usually.

1384~~~
He gets better every game he doesn't play.

1385~~~
Nobody played well today. So no point singling out one. It seems to be a malais going through the team.

1386~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I had a similar thought about Fellaini today. Probably our worst player and our biggest threat.

1387~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thats kind of typical Fellaini for me. They'll be 20 minutes left in a game and he'll have been shit for the first 70 but I still don't want him to come off because you just know he can pull something out of his ass that the others just aren't capable of.

1388~~~
It's useless criticising and defending any sort of player atm under LVG. 

(ok my man love for Herrera is still strong, let me be blinded ok?!)

1389~~~
van Gaal or not, his passing was shocking. He continuously passed straight to the other team.

1390~~~
At least he tried. He had a stinker. I would be worrying more about the ones who just don't do anything. They are the big problem. I will still bang on about him playing further forward. How the hell Fellaini gets in this side I do not know. Oh I do know we are short of strikers.

1391~~~
Maybe its not a coincidence that our best passes tend to be our worst players under Van Gaal. Not forgetting Paul Scholes even said he'd hate to play in this team, because all you can do is pass and just hope someone does something with it. Theirry Henry mentioned this last week. There are no runners in our side. Our attackers are forced to keep position all of the time. This is always going to hurt the likes of Herrera and Mata.

1392~~~
I'm not having this at least he tried. They weren't difficult passes he was trying, they were mainly square balls out wide or into the middle. Bog standard passes that he was getting completely wrong. His most passes were to Jones and Mata who is never in an attacking position. He made one pass near towards the opposition box. So, no I am not having he tried to create stuff because he really didn't. He was shit and couldn't even do the basics right. Everyone else was shit too, but so was Ander and I'm sick of the excuses he gets.

1393~~~
Oh my days he was the essence of bad.

1394~~~
He was poor. I still think he was our best player. At least he attempts to make something happen. He looks for an odd through ball. He doesn't hide away from possession either.

1395~~~
Pretty sure thats the opposite of Rooney mate. It was his fault we went 2 0 down today.

1396~~~
I like the guy, but can somebody please tell me what his best position is, and whether he's actually good enough for a top team in said position. ive never seen him dominate a game as a no.8 and when i see the likes of Ozil, isco, silva eriksen etc etc destroying teams as a no.10, i dont see him comparable in that position either.

1397~~~
still easily our best midfielder today, as carrick didnt show up, he made so many good interceptions and tackles, amde up for his bad passing today, but you can tell the guy tried and wasnt hiding with a captain band on his arm. 

defo deserves to start alongside schneiderlin next game

1398~~~
The big mistake was not having Morgan in that midfield as well. One up front with Herrera the most foward midfielder. Instead we had two in midfield away from home, yet LvG insists at time playing three in midfield (2 DM's at that) at home. Then we had Fellaini up front under this misconception that he is actually good in the air. I am sure Martial would appreciate little through balls from Herrera than hoping Fellaini can knock the ball down.

1399~~~
Yea, 0 and 3.

1400~~~
have you seen who played around him today? he was in the midfield alone doing all job defensively, he tried hard to make us look good but when carrick doesnt show up and fellaini is everywhere but not where we need him then how can you possibly judge Herrera? I think his best position is as no8 but he didnt paly like this today much, he had to drop too deep at times and never had a player to link with up front either as fellaini just cant do this as he is all the time trying to get into box and completely misses in the build up higher up the pitch as he cant operate in tight spaces.. Herrera will be our best player once we get Schneiderlin back and change the system to more aggresive and attacking, he would be unstoppable under someone like Klopp or Pochettino, I just wish the next manager will try to play high line as a lot of players would benefited form it as well as us fans, get rid of Rooney, get someone Kane who puts up pressure form the top and the other players will thrive

1401~~~
The problem is LVG had that oaf also known as Fellaini playing in the #10 position, and for some reason he was playing as a deep-lying midfielder, which he isn't.

1402~~~
Don't you think that is a trait of LvG. Instead of playing players in the positions that attracted the club to them in the first place, he will insist of trying to remould them into something else. You wouldn't dare admit to him that when you were 5 you played one game at LB as that will be your position for the rest of the season.

1403~~~
As the attacking box-to-box in a three man midfield. This can be done in a lot of ways, but just to highlight a couple:

1. Surround him with a passer/ creator who can control the tempo of the game (like Thiago), and a defensive midfielder/ defensive box to box who can work from deeper areas (Javi). This will allow Ander to link up with the forwards and go on barnstorming runs, while also providing energy to your midfield because of his relentless running/ pressing style.

2. Surround him with a defensive box to box, and a holding midfielder who is an expert at passing from deeper areas (like Xabi Alonso or Carrick from last season). Pretty much the same as above in terms of what he will do. Ander will provide loads of energy, workrate, quick one touch play, and just hound the opposition into submission like he did at Athletic Club for Bielsa.

IMO, we have the players to field that kind of midfield:

<span style="color: #ffffff">-------</span>Schweinsteiger<span style="color: #ffffff">----------------------------</span>Ander<span style="color: #ffffff">---------
-----------------------------</span>Schneiderlin<span style="color: #ffffff">------------------------</span>

As soon as we signed Fußballgott and Schneiderlin in the summer, I for one thought we would see this lineup as a progression of our 4-1-4-1 from last season, or maybe sometimes Carrick in Schneiderlin's position and Morgan operating as the left sided defensive box to box. For some odd reason, we have done the exact opposite and IMO aren't playing to the strength of our midfield personnel. Playing Ander in front of a static midfield with an unresponsive striker like Rooney up front, or as a midfield pivot (which restricts his mobility) is just so counterproductive because Ander thrives on movement and quick passing moves. 

For some reason, under both David and Van Gaal, we've had problems fitting players in their best positions (Fellaini and Kagawa under the former, and too many to name under the latter). And it's really sad in a way because these kind of players will leave, and start performing for their new clubs (no one epitomizes this better than Kagawa who's back to his best in a fluid system under Tuchel).

1404~~~
oh yeah I can as well say 10 and 10..
anyway if you watched the game you could see how many times Herrera won the ball for us, might be a combination of two players in that regard but he was always the one involved when we won the ball with his great passing, forcing a player to go over the line etc.. the points stays the same, he was defensively very good, the only player in midfield who contributed to that aspect of our game there

1405~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> true. It's the same trait that saw ADM being made into a left sided central midfielder one game and a striker the next; Daley Blind a centre-half; Martial a left winger and Young pretty much every position other than GK. He thinks he's some sort of managerial Yoda when in fact these ideas are only best tried out in a Football Manager game.

1406~~~
You'd make numbers up then, I'm talking straight statistics here.

I watched the game, he won the ball for us three times, he's probably lost it far more times than he recovered it. His passing was hardly amazing, it was 80% correct and only 20 of his passes out of 59 were forward. To say that he was 'defensively very good' is borderline delusion, unless we're trying to glorify him as 'the best midfielder from our team today' which still doesn't say much as we've had three clowns in the midfield today and probably around 9 overall on the pitch.

So yea, it's actually nice seeing what you want to see, probably makes the life a bit more enjoyable but then you don't really want to tell people that they should watch the game.

1407~~~
That still tickles me before games on MUTV when they announce the team and everyone says their name and position and poor Ashley just says Ashley Young. Even he doesn't know what he is.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1408~~~
We are all only seeing what we want to see including you. Not taking into account if the formation suits, conditions, fitness, if your teammates are pulling their weight.

1409~~~
Oh, but I really am, I don't blame Herrera, mind you, I blame LVG for all the mess that's happening right now. But I can't really understand some people's need to make shit up. You really have to be delusional to claim that Herrera played well today when the team gets outplayed by a fecking Stoke away, he's completing 80% of passes and our midfield (as a unit) is nonexistant and he's obviously one of the culprits of it.

I, just like most of people here, was a fan of his when we played 4141 last season and he was one of the #8s, made this point numerous times. He, however, does not work well in double #6 role or the #10 role either. For some reason, even when we've played with 2 of our last season's #8s, LVG decides to force them to play as a #10 and it doesn't work for some reason. Last season those two #8s had their roles outlined and knew what to do, nowadays it seems that whoever drops to #10 doesn't know what to do.

I'm pretty sure that Ander will get back to his fine form once LVG's out of the door and if we insist on playing in a system that suits him. But to claim that he's doing fine this season, in whatever position really, is simply not true.

1410~~~
Sorry I will then make you a favour and wont reply to your comments anymore you clearly dont see football as a team sport and the logic behind it, Herrera contributed well to our defensive play today and showed some grit unlike other players who failed to contribute to the game, you can bring up the statistics but it says as much as that carrick had 90% passing acc. We were criticized for not taking risks and trying and when a player who played three games over two months finally tries, he's nothing but criticized while being entirely overlooked his defensive contribution, if you want to use just statistics to measure that then you can actually watch teletext. 

People should take some positives form our game and not only criticize and sound grumpy about a player who deserved a bit of credit, the one of two or three today..

1411~~~
He didn't play well, no, as you say that is yet again down to the manager. He seems at time to be able to pick a pretty good team, until it actually takes to the field and you realise he has most of them in the wrong position. That is a real knack.

1412~~~
So we should pretend that something positive has happened today when there was absolutely nothing positive on the pitch? Alrighty then. Mind you that 'my favourite player played today which is a positive' is not really a positive in my book.

<a class="username" data-user="60388, @DomesticTadpole" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60388/">@DomesticTadpole</a> Glad we agree.

1413~~~
So, it's everyone else's fault,except his. I don't know why it's so difficult for people to just say their favourite player was poor on this a particular day. A great player should be able to make those around him look better.

1414~~~
He's not a great player though, he's a damn good player. Carrick is supposed to be the great player.

1415~~~
He's a good player, but I feel judgement of him is clouded by his personality, he seems to be a great guy, most people like him. But he hasn't done it consistently at United [for many reasons, some of which are beyond his control] and that's how it is right now, for me atleast. He needs to do more to earn that level of loyalty. All in all, he's a good player [am not sure what his best position is] but he's nowhere near worldclass for now, and am not sure he's as good as United fans want us to believe. Having said that, when everyone is fit, he, along with Schneiderlin & Schweinsteiger should be starting in midfield.

1416~~~
I don't think Carrick is great, he's a good player & so too is Herrera, but he was poor today. Most things I read here about Herrera gives an impression of a great player, so, I expect his presence to have that effect on his mates.

1417~~~
Ander needs someone world class in there with him. Carrick has never been world class, no matter how some fans have overhyped him. Problem is of course unless the board act and bring in a world renown manager and we don't plummet down the league, that world class player will not materialise.

1418~~~
quote me where I said its not his fault, sure it is his fault as well he's part of the team a disfunctional one and I criticised him for his passing but he contributed to the team more than anyone except young. 

Beside that have you ever played football I mean competitively, every week 90 mins? Have you played midfield? And have you tried that on your own. Say I was kinda Herrera type of player, covering a lot of ground, tryna be creative at the same time and this happened to me quite a lot of times when I played for the older group, we didnt have fellaini but played two strikers instead and had exactly this kind of player (Carrick), this experienced fella who was great on the ball but he was fecking walking on the pitch unable to catch the tempo, I was there for the running it was insane at times, I was desperate to make a bit more contribution but I couldnt simply because I wasted all my energy for the basic things, sacrificing for the team.. 

so I think I kinda understand whats going on the pitch right now, while other people seem to only watch football from tv and playing fifa, thinking they played football at PE at school or for univ and know how it works but I wont tell its you or others but there are certainly many of them here judging by the comments.

And again Im not justifying Herrera's performance but he was there today on his own trying to contribute while others didnt even try with much more experience and expectation to perform. I dont expect a player coming after such a long time out without any match rhytm to a disfunctional team without any confidence to come and change suddenly everything..

1419~~~
I honestly think this is one of the things I most look forward to in a new manager: buying players and playing them in their proper position. And if they're not good enough in their proper position (Fellaini, Rooney, possibly Mata,) then they shouldn't be part of the team.

1420~~~
I don't what people expect from Herrera when he's on the field with Fellaini, it was the same with Mata at #10, the way we play with Fellaini on the pitch deprives either player of a partner, a player to link up with, he is too far up the pitch (plays more as a second striker). It's almost as if they are on their own bringing the ball out from the back with very little support.
Fellaini should not be in the squad to start with once we sort this issue out then we can start building a cohesively functional midfield.

1421~~~
He should have been in Fellaini's position.

1422~~~
He's a high energy player. Whether it's Mourinho, Guardiola or van Gaal - I don't see him lasting long at the club. 
None of them are going to consistently play a high-energy system like that Bilbao team. And that's what he needs. 

He's not a measured player. It's been nice having him. 
It's a shame, because this team needs a bit of 'Bilbao' to their game.

1423~~~
Bielsa it is then.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1424~~~
What exactly is Fellaini's position?
He should take Fellaini's spot in the starting 11 but should play a totally different role to him.

1425~~~
Sorry, I meant as an advanced AM No. 10. Not a useless lump hoping we hoof the ball to him No. 10.

1426~~~
Agree

1427~~~
Klopp. *hides*

1428~~~
That would have been a good shout, successful and enthusiastic.

1429~~~
He was bad yesterday but I won't blame him too much as he's recently returned from injury.

One of the reasons I want Jose to be our manager is because I believe he'll elevate Herrera's game to another level as he's done with many other midfielders such as Lampard, Sneijder, Maniche, Essien, Cambiasso, Motta, Deco etc. Jose loves well rounded MF's that can attack and defend and Herrera is exactly that.

LvG seems to think Herrera is a No.10 and can't be trusted in midfield but we saw last season that his best performances came in a sort of box to box role.

1430~~~
I think he could have a bit of a run under Mourinho, possibly as his #10. He has just as much of a goal threat and is far more creative than Oscar was at his best.

Rooney does still exist, though.

1431~~~
Yeah, I don't see why Mourinho wouldn't like him. Hardworking, mobile, not afraid of a tackle but still has good technical ability - Jose likes these kind of players.

1432~~~
He's quality. He needs to play week in week out. Playing 1 game in 5 won't let us see the best of him. He had a poor game yday, but who didn't ?

1433~~~
Always been the player to lay it off to the winger, good so far.

1434~~~
It's no wonder he's so overrated on here if this is what is deemed to be a good game. He's been very average, lucky not to have been booked a few times with rash challenges and ineffectual on the ball.

1435~~~
Nah he's been average today compared to his usual standards. Getting stuck in but on the ball he hasn't done all that much really. He can and usually does play a lot better then this.

1436~~~
Bang average. He suffers from Berbatov/Kagawa syndrome. Everyone wants him to be amazing but he's just average really.

1437~~~
He's done a better job in the hole than most would have today. Not really saying much though.

1438~~~
Seriously, what's your problem with him?

You didn't post for 7 days, you barely comment United players on here, and yet your last two posts in a row are about Herrera. One of them is about his tackle that was yellow at most, in half in which our players made far worse tackles.

At least admit you hate him for some reason, it's quite obvious.

1439~~~
Scousers don't like him because he had the nerve to be kicked by Stevie G.

1440~~~
I think he has always had an agenda against him, ever since we signed him. Bob is always quite objective here when it comes to United-Liverpool comparision here. Maybe he is just jealous Liverpool didn't sign him.

1441~~~
rawk wanted Herrera red carded for that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1442~~~
He's an utter twat, in Spain I disliked him because he barely went a game without trying to break someone's legs and he's the exact same here

Plus he's not very good and it annoyed me how many people overrated his Athletic Club performances.

1443~~~
Behave yourself

1444~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You're an absolute clown when it comes to assessing some players. Totally blind to what actually happens on the pitch and just spewing out the same nonsense. Name all these instances of Herrera's attempted leg breaks whilst he has been in England or shut up.

1445~~~
You're a bit dim aren't you?

1446~~~
Should have scored his chance. I don't know why we keep missing chances. With Moyes, it was as if every opposition attack or a mistake by us got punished by a goal. With Van Gaal, it seems as if the pivotal chances are not taken again and again.

1447~~~
Was knackered toward the end. Basically baby sat all of Rooney's shanked touches and buzzed around him to give him an option when he did manage to control stuff though. 

It is to the surprise of nobody that we looked better with the Schmidfield and Herrera 10 combo.

1448~~~
Rooney played far better than him today.

1449~~~
His technique is just not 'Spanish' enough, and he can be headless. I've liked him, but his technique isn't polished enough, and I don't see him being good enough for a serious team.

He has everything Mata doesn't, but he could do with Mata's clean touch.

Shame. Guardiola wouldn't like him that much, and I don't think Mourinho would either.
Even Pochettino, who would love his energy, would hate his headlessness and lack of consistency with the ball.

1450~~~
I thought he was the worst of all our midfielders. Not bad but didn't show much quality with the ball. Best work was his movement and running which tbf helped Mata and Rooney.

1451~~~
That's not very Joe Allen of him!

I thought he played well for 60 minutes or so and then tired.

1454~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What? He's certainly combative, but he's not a malicious player in slightest.

Maybe it was his 90th minute goal against Barca <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1455~~~
You couldn't be any more wrong.

Only time he was involved in breaking leg situation here was when Gerrard wanted to break his leg.

1456~~~
.... really? He likes a tackle yes, trying to break legs... no

1457~~~
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Gerrard  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1458~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wow, so we go around picking managers and just guessing what qualities they would like/wouldnt like in a player? Is there anybody in our team apart De Gea that would survive this test?

1459~~~
Agree. But hes the caf's wanking material so Rooney is shit and Herrera is god.

Thought he was poor in attack and defence today. People say hes combative but i just see clumsy and rash. He needs games i think but he missed our best chance today which was a real shame.

For me he is not good enough to start but we have no better options.

Silva
Ozil
Hazard
Coutinho
Erikson
Herrera

Hm.

1460~~~
I would have thought not being entirely Spanish in technique is why he is quite suited to the PL. Bilbao are not a typical Spanish side.

1461~~~
Look at a Guardiola team, and he doesn't play players as scrappy/headless/unpolished as Herrera. Not sure what's funny there.

Mourinho likes his hard-workers, but again, not headless runners. Discipline is huge for him. He also likes his players to be reliable on the ball, because his whole system is based on tranisitions from defence to attack. Again, not sure what's funny. It's not guessing; it's looking at his past squads.

Pochettino may like him, actually, but he'd have to curb his headlessness.

As for who would be up to Guardiola/Mourinho's highest standards, in terms of a starting eleven?
Martial, De Gea, Smalling, Shaw, Schneiderlin (less so for Guardiola) That's about it.
Most of the rest wouldn't look out of place at Tottenham, Everton or even Southampton.

1462~~~
Dreadful post.

1463~~~
By the way Rooney was shit. Funny how M.E.N gave him one of the highest ratings and said he played really well, but like a lot of the players tired in the 2nd half, especially after 4-5 weeks out, that might just happen. Yet Rooney got one of the worst, he was never MoM, that was DeGea, but his buddies on BT thought different. Rooney is finished. Sorry Hazard was awful today as well, all he did was roll about. Ozil when he is bothered, I would give you and Silva, when he isn't injured.

1464~~~
Good game. Got stuck in and played with intent. For a player who apparently said he would leave if LvG is the manager, seemed to play well for him today. that tackle on hazard was utterly stupid though. If that was fellaini who did that, he would have been critiscized to death

1465~~~
He's a 7/10 player. Long term should we want a team challenging for the champions league i'm not convinced he starts.

1466~~~
No tackle on Hazard is stupid.

1467~~~
He doesn't. He can be part of a team that has its moment and wins a cup or two (like Mata) but a team that has the potential to dominate/seriously challenge for four or five years? No. Same for his mate Mata.

1468~~~
If LvG is stopping we will be a long way from challenging for the CL. I am afraid that is going to take years.

1469~~~
Yeah he's such a hatchet man isn't he

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1470~~~
We aren't challenging for anything soon. I think the odd cup will be out lot. If LvG is stopping and they are determined to go with Giggs we will not be up with the best for a while. There is going to be too much upheaval.

1471~~~
It's what £30m buys you these days.

What state has football got into!

1472~~~
yes that is true too :P

1473~~~
What is wrong with a 7/10 player? Especially when we have a captain who is 4/5. That is what happens with buyout clauses from clubs that don't want to and don't really need to sell. He will be fine. Not sure out club will be but Herrera will always put the effort in. If the clubs fails it will not be his fault, it will be idiotic decisions by the board.

1474~~~
I quite enjoyed the tackle on Hazard, in a strange way. He gave him a trip, then seemed to give him an almighty kicking as he was on his way down. Probably could have had a yellow card for each kick <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1475~~~
Ozil when he's not bothered is above Herrera.

Herrera's a good PL midfielder on par with a Henderson or a fit Wilshere. No more.

1476~~~
we need more than 7/10 players, so spending £30m on a bunch of them doesn't seem what we want to do.

How much is a 9/10 player?

1477~~~
Wilshere is considered by a lot as an absolute gem. So not sure that's the put down you were looking for<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1478~~~
Wilshere's better, in my opinion. 
Well... when he's fit.

1479~~~
Yeah I know though I don't see him as that good <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>. I think his injury lay-offs elevate his quality as it's so long since he's had a run of games.

Maybe Cabaye is more apt.

1480~~~
Liverpool fan putting down a United player shocker.

1481~~~
Still think he is at his best in a midfield 3 but not as a 10.

1482~~~
Oh I don't like him, he's a horrible aggressive little twat of a bloke, who smacks of "right" to be where he is.

Misses way more games than he ever plays.

1483~~~
ps yep Cabaye is a better put down!

1484~~~
His lack of discipline irritated me today. It actually angered me that he kicked Hazard, clear for all to see, and then tried to protest to the referee that he got the ball. This is merely short-term anger towards him, but fecking hell - what a twat.

Anyway, apart from his fouling - thought he was pretty average. Few neat touches, and should have scored really.

1485~~~
I'd say 100m now.

1486~~~
Typical caf.

''Our players never do tactical fouls, or show some aggressiveness, all of them so soft and a bunch of pussies''.

One player does what was lamented here and missing for a few weeks now, oh he is such a twat, hate him, cnut <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1487~~~
That's true. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1488~~~
I love him for doing that. Rather have that than players who hide and we have plenty of them. He's bothered about not winning.

1489~~~
Yep. The game was begging for Herrera to sit deeper next to Schneiderlin and a more attacking player to play in the advanced position.

1490~~~
This is a genuine question, what is the tangible difference between a no.10 and one of the more offensive positions in a midfield 3? without going into fifa level generalisations.

Because a lot of excuses have been made for him over the past 18 months as to his position, I personally don't see how the difference in those 2 positions changes him from a fairly good player to a exceptional one, given his skillset.

When he's played deeper and doesnt look solid, people say he needs to be further forward, and when he's played further forward people say he's not a 10.

1491~~~
The very least of our problems.

1492~~~
I like him but I think we need better players.

1493~~~
How about we stick to the current setup for more than a game at a time. Its okay switching out Bastian and Carrick but to keep fecking about with our midfield on a game to game basis is annoying and builds zero consistency.

People in here expect a player to come in the team and give a 9/10 performance after being out of it for a few months.

1494~~~
Exactly the only midfielders that should be rotated are Bastian/Michael because of their age. Rotation is only for big squads, take note LvG. How on earth do you expect them to build up any rhythm and understanding if you keep changing it. Lets just hope Ander and Morgan can now stay fit for the rest of the campaign.

1495~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CXVS3JcW8AEkpah.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CXVS3JcW8AEkpah.jpg:large"/>

1496~~~
He was alright I thought. We looked more fluid in attack with him as the #10 anyway. His fouls are a bit annoying. Fellaini cops a lot for being dirty and stuff but Herrera is arguably more aggressive and reckless.

1497~~~
Herrera is basically our Willian,  very underrated, just needs to stay fit and be put in a different more aggressive philosophy/system, the same with Scheiderlin, both players like to press higher up the pitch , and they win a lot of balls which can give us great positions to start attacks unlike when we are too passive and wait for the opponent to lose the ball and we start attack from the deep. This is just shit system and even though these too doesnt fit it that well they are still one of our best players, dont know what ppl are expecting..

1498~~~
Just getting back from the game today. Thought he was excellent. A couple of needless fouls but otherwise kept it ticking over very nicely, had several very nice touches under notable  pressure and won the ball back superbly on multiple occasions.

1499~~~
He's got a nice hustle about him, never stops moving always tries to create something either on the ball or pressing off of it. That kind of constant movement in the attacking third creates chances.

Sometimes he gets the better of himself with those silly fouls but he means good. Him along with Schneiderlin should start every one of our remaining fixtures. with Carrick and Basti rotating for the other spot.

1500~~~
You keep talking about his headlessness and telling Mourinho would not like him. Have you seen Ramires play and he was a starter under Mourinho.

1501~~~
He seems to be the most vocal/passionate among the front 6, along with Bastian.  Like players that actually care about winning.  Future vice-captain maybe?

1502~~~
I think he's more of our Ramires.

1503~~~
Love him. He really does make us play when he has the added protection of the Schmidfield behind him, allowing him to make those late runs into the box. Was unlucky not to score.

1504~~~
Not sure what game everyone else was watching. I thought he had a really good game. Was involved in most of what was good in attack for United.

His run for the chance was first class and he did little wrong with the finish. It was an outstanding save by Courtois. There is much more urgency about United's play when Herrera is in the team.

1505~~~
Agree he has more quality but less running pace. Great little player to have around the squad with potential to stay in the team when starting. Nicky Butt like standing in the squad for me.

1506~~~
I think he was great yesterday, yeah he booted hazard Good! if hazard had gone on and whacked it in the top corner we would have all been saying why didn't someone
hit him? he did. Don't complain about that, scholes would have booted him harder .
Every challenge he was involved in was aggressive and I love that in a player .

1507~~~
Was poor yesterday, does get over rated by our fans.

1508~~~
He needs to relax a bit more when he has the ball. Gets too excited at times despite having good technique, which results in him misplacing simple passes at times. I do like his tenacity though.

1509~~~
he had a poor spell in the middle of the game, Hazard was giving him hard time but he was good at the beginning of the game and at the end as well, winning the ball and being creative. 6,5/10, 6 being the standard..

1510~~~
he seems lately like at the start of his campaign here, more in preseason when he was so erratic and full of energy but couldnt make his tackles right and misplaced passes, he was still a good performer like he was against chelsea yesterday but it only took him a few weeks to cut this out of his game and he was great since, now he's kinda back to it but he only got back to the side, not sure if he's fully fit yet, Schneiderlin will certainly help him to get into form like he does to everyone else around him. I'd like us to build that core of midfield from players with a good tackling ability, full of legs and some creativity as well, might wanna replace Carrick in the summer with someone younger as well to rotate with Sweinsteigger

1511~~~
I thought he was good.

1512~~~
exactly, maybe an extended run in the team will help. Him and Schneiderlin should always start IMO and we can rotate Carrick and Bastian.

1513~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Dec/ander-herrera-has-message-for-manchester-united-fans-after-shows-of-faith-v-stoke-and-chelsea.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...after-shows-of-faith-v-stoke-and-chelsea.aspx</a>

1514~~~
He looks rather rusty and that's to be expected really. Showed he has a sinister side yesterday, mad man at times.

1515~~~
Love him. Hopefully he improves. He's saying all the right things there and I like how annoyed he seems to be.

1516~~~
This is SPARTA... i mean OLD TRAFFORD!

1517~~~
Yeah, didn't think I'd do what he said any justice if I quoted it.

1518~~~
Done well got himself into the game. Loved the backheel for the CJB cross showed nice awareness. His energy was good.

1519~~~
Aye.

1520~~~
Ander was fantastic yesterday.  Easily one of the first names for the starting XI.

1521~~~
For me the best player in the team currently on what he does. He needs to start every game till the end of the season, get back in full form and see how the team's fortunes improve.

1522~~~
Him and Morgan should be starting every game with one of Carrick or Bastian behind them ala Pirlo.

Hes far from the biggest problem in our team.

1523~~~
With him and Schneiderlin starting every game we'll definitely look so much better. Having Mata infront of Carrick and Fellaini for example is just dire.

Herrera infront of Schweini and Schneiderlin will be brilliant. Front 3 of Martial and 2 others who've got more than 10% pass/shot/cross accuracy out of Rooney/Memphis/Young etc.

1524~~~
Barring DDG, I think he's our best player also. I'd build the team around him.

1525~~~
More reserved today, not a bad performance but in a #10 role he needs to offer more support in the box.

1526~~~
Looked a little rusty, seemed always 0,1 second late in his tackles. But I like his style and we should definitely stick with him in no10.

1527~~~
His industry is really important. I don't believe he is the traditional #10 but a free roaming #8, part of a midfield 3 in a 433 with only one DM. He did good today. Not his best performance but ok.

1528~~~
I think he is important to the team, because we need his running and stitching up moves all over the field.

1529~~~
He didn't play as a number 10 today. He played on the right of a midfield diamond in a 3-4-3. Even after United changed to a back 4 he stayed on the right of a midfield 3.

1530~~~
Decent today. He should stop giving needless freekicks just outside the box. Gave 2 or 3 in the last 2 games. His energy is good though. Wilingness to get stuck in

1531~~~
Not a very good game today. I'm not sure he has a clear role in the team as he seems a bit lost at times. He's neat and tidy but still loses the ball too often.

1532~~~
Okayish performance.Nothing much to worry or excite.

1533~~~
I thought he was crap today, gave the ball away far too many times. At least on the positive he was trying to get the ball forward.

1534~~~
He was pretty bad today i thought. Too many fouls, too many mistakes/mishit passes and the game was running past him. I dont like that he is constantly looking for Mata and plays some different passes to him and we lose the ball therefore.

1535~~~
He's really not as good as people want him to be. 

Eventually, as we strengthen, he should become a squad player, but for now he should keep playing and is not a major problem.

1536~~~
I'm a huge fan of Ander but he frustrated me today, seemed more interested in passing backwards to his mate Mata and slowing the game down than looking up and playing forward.

Not sure why he froze when through early in the first half as well, should've shot or squared it.

1537~~~
great start, too tidy in the rest of the game, overall okay performance, nothing really that bad like some people here say, he ran there well and that's also why we won the battle in the middle of the park and he's all of a sudden squad player by some <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1538~~~
Terrible performance. Gives away too many fouls for no reason.

1539~~~
Would love to see what he can do under a different manager. He's nowhere near what he had shown at Athletic.

1540~~~
This will need to be an enormous strengthening. His energy and enthusiasm is blindingly contrasting compared to most of the team. He seems like one of the few who actually cares about winning. He has ups and downs in form but overall nobody else offers what he does at the moment.

1541~~~
I only saw the second half and after 15 minutes I thought he must have got hurt and subbed off because I didn't see him once. Did absolutely nothing after that either.

1542~~~
He's had a crap couple of games. His discipline is really starting to irritate me. Gives away needless fouls - it's fine if they are ones that relieve the pressure and slows down the opposition's tempo, but this isn't the case.

1543~~~
Scrappy first half, followed by a disappearing act for most of the second. I'll keep playing him though if the alternative is Fellaini.

1544~~~
So over rated by the cafe.  

Today was a typical performance:  indisciplined, scrappy and ineffective. 

I don't get what all the fuss is about.

1545~~~
We play better with him on the pitch even if he specifically doesn't play well. It's his energy and the positions he takes up which makes a difference compared to the others we have.

1546~~~
He was crap but it's more the fact that almost all of our best football from the past 18 months has come with him in the side, rather than him being a world beater. If it's him or Fellaini I pick him every time even slightly off form

1547~~~
He's a definite starter for me, not great today but offers is much more movement and urgency to our game, an ideal #10.

1548~~~
Quite erratic but has added much-needed energy/movement to our team.

1549~~~
He needs to start offering something much more. I am a big fan of his but he's not been good enough. He currently plays because our other alternatives are worse. I believe there is much more in him but he needs to show it. I also want him to have a clear, specific position - he seems to be a bit lost at times

1550~~~
Who doesn't look lost at the moment? Those who are team players, who aren't capable of individual brilliant like Martial are all struggling to an extent. They are having problems creating because they haven't got the options of a fully functional team around them to combine with.

1551~~~
We're much better with Ander than without.  This is his second or third start recently and the rest of the squad is far from top gear, so the man shouldn't be judged too harshly.

1552~~~
I am not sure if many have noticed but he is the only player who is capable of playing the pass and move game. He passes the ball and goes in a clear space to receive the ball.

Others just have no clue of what passing is all about.

The amount of times, you see the player with the ball at his feet, holding his hands up in the air frustrated at no one being open to receive the ball. 

Ander needs to be in the first 11 all the time. He needs to build his game and the only way he can do that is by playing regularly. He has never been given the opportunity to have a full season of starts due to his injuries and LVG's ego.

1553~~~
Problem with the pass and move game is that he is in such a hurry to do it, a lot of his passes don't come off right. The idea is great and I wish more of the team would have his desire to move the ball quicker and also make themselves available but, he needs to be able to get the ball where it needs to otherwise the movement is useless.

Maybe if he actually gets a run of games he'll get more of that timing and his passing in order - and that's key, for him to stay in the team because even though he is not playing all that great right now, he does add that bit of urgency to our game.

1554~~~
Such arbitrary, agenda forwarding conjecture, Ander has in the main played when fit this year. Presumed ego comes nowhere near the discussion.

1555~~~
Ok, i might be wrong but from what i recollect, he came back from injury was not started immediately while the same rules did not seem to apply to rooney.

I actually want LVG to stay but it is very clear that LVG is not a man manager at all. There was even some rumors that Herrera might leave at the end of the season. Doesn't bode well for United if this is true.

Let's see if he gets to start games now, will only help him get more game time which will help the team perform better.

1556~~~
I don't recall if Rooney's injury was muscle or impact related but Herrera's definitely was a hamstring problem, it made sense to not rush him back into starting particularly when we had cover. In terms of players returning that week it was always going to be one or the other rather than both. Particularly over Christmas.

1557~~~
Can't play in a midfield two and is a shite number 10. Other than that he's alright.

1558~~~
we should make sure Barcelona and/or Pep dont come sniffing for him.

1559~~~
Hasn't been playing well recently.

1560~~~
Abysmal. He's playing safe as well.

1561~~~
With every games, you can see he's progressing. He's been getting worse and worse.

1562~~~
Even as big Herrrera's fan it's not hard to admit he is having really poor season. Still not much worse than any of our midfielders or forwards.

1563~~~
One of the few players I enjoyed watching even in our shittest moments and he's started playing like a nob as well. It's literally just Dave, Mike and Martial left. 

Luke Shaw could sneak onto the podium for POTY at this rate

1564~~~
Why is this happening though, there must be a reason. We have two away games this coming week. I can see Newcastle turning up for a change and god help LvG if we lose at Liverpool and badly.

1565~~~
It's because LVG's idea of football is totally unsuited to him. Like most of our players. Not absolving him of any blame because he's not playing well and messing up the basics

1566~~~
Am now convinced he is vastly over rated.  Was invisible until I saw him trudge off being substituted.  Abysmal.

Complain about Rooney as much as we like, it's herrera's job to get him involved and provide service.  Herrera was nowhere to be seen

1567~~~
He's been really shite since the haircut.

1568~~~
he seems like he's philosophied already

1569~~~
I always quite liked him but I completely agree with you. For some reason he gets a pass on here like none of the other players do, even though he rarely does anything of note.

1570~~~
He was poor today and deserves the complaining just like Mata, Rooney and Fellaini.

1571~~~
Dogshit recently.

I love him but yeah, he's been dogshit.

1572~~~
It will be interesting to see our performance at Liverpool next weekend. Last season it was a joy. Klopp has his team up for the big teams. We will see how much damage LvG has done to the confidence of these players. I think it is a confidence thing with Herrera.

1573~~~
He shouldn't be playing behind the striker. He's nowhere near creative enough for it and he isn't a good enough goal scorer. If we're being honest he's overrated on this forum because of how pedestrian the rest of our midfield is.

1574~~~
You keep saying every week that he is overrated, despite majority here saying he is poor lately, and lots of people repeating he is overrated just like you. How exactly is he overrated then, by who?

1575~~~
He has a huge fanboy clan on here, but I struggle to see what any of it is based on.

1576~~~
He was poor, no two ways about it.

1577~~~
Any of what? Who exactly is praising him? Just because he has fanboys who like him in general doesn't mean he is overrated. Many of us(fanboys, if you can call me one) will easily admit he is poor this season.

1578~~~
That is why I am saying about the Liverpool game. That was one of the highlights for Ander last season. Whatever side LvG picks has to live up to that performance. Ander took risks, he was edgy. He either isn't fit or the system is wrong. Problem is another manager would fit the system to the players and get the best out of them. LvG is a law unto himself. I don't think a lot of these players are enjoying their football. They can't be, nobody wants the crowd having a go at them all the time.

1579~~~
He was crap today, no one seems to know whether he's a number 10 or a centre midfielder.

1580~~~
Not sure he knows either. He seems to have caught the malais that is affecting most of the team.

1581~~~
Poor today and poor overall this season. Don't blame him much though.

He's a box to box midfielder, wasted at #10.

1582~~~
LvG and his cronies are supposed to be so meticulous, yet I doubt he has any idea where or how the players he has bought played for their former clubs.

1583~~~
This. He should be a squad player for us. Not one of our best options for an attacking midfield / 10 role...

1584~~~
I think he is more a No. 8.

1585~~~
As much as it hurts, he has become the new Kagawa. He would do better, undoubtedly, in a different system though. He is not suited to this slow-slow pick your pass carefully style of football.

1586~~~
He has come from a side that harried and harassed teams into submission. This slow stuff must be as awful to him as it is to us.

1587~~~
Would like to see a manager come in and play him in a normal 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 as a box to box midfielder, and actually in a quick, attacking style that encourages taking risks. When he joined us he tried through passes all the time, now I don't remember when the last time he tried one was. He'd be great at a team like Arsenal or City I think. Van Gaal is wasting every single attack minded player we have though.

1588~~~
Wouldn't go as far as to say he's overrated, but he's not in good form. I think he'll bounce back. People love to go to extremes based on a few games.

1589~~~
Was absolutely awful. Our worst player IMO.

1590~~~
I think what sammsky1 is asking in general is 'what is he good at to be rated so highly (by fanboys)'.

Imo it's his all round high level skillset. Positionally I think he needs to find his 'game' (but half of that is defined by a manager imo) but if he can show what he has shown before, you are looking at a very very good midfielder.

Shame you can't really judge how sh|t he's been because of lack of talent (according to some) or LVG.

I still believe a manager like Klopp, Poch or Simone would have our squad blitzing through teams.

The key to those manager's philosophies? Having athletes (so you wouldn't get bullied physically and have the stamina to press and attack) with good all round abilities (to defend and attack at the same time).

DDG, Smalling, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Martial (also Shaw and Valencia) would be the top tier spine then your Lingard, Memphis, Darmian, Young, Schweinsteiger, Blind, Matas etc would compliment the team in their roles.

It's simple really. We expend so much energy going square and running back into shape, so even with all that useless possession, we look lethargic and vulnerable when attacking. Instead get your Klopps and Poch to get the players to press, defend and attack down the middle in speed. More sprints but if managed carefully, you probably expend 'less' exhaustive energy but creating more space and attacking situations for your players to work triangles, one-twos, through balls etc etc.

1591~~~
With each passing game the life of a player soo full of energy is being drained

1592~~~
I like him - he's got a good attitude, feisty and a crowd pleaser but a 'cog', rather than a someone who dictates/changes games. 

I see why us fans like him but in opposition to how some people talk about him, he's hardly irreplaceable. 

Think he could be better in another system, mind.

1593~~~
Stick where stick is due... he was shit.

1594~~~
This is actually true.

1595~~~
He was good last year, hence the fan boys.

He has been wank this year though, can play at number 10 and be making such bad passing choices.

1596~~~
He's getting worse as a player, along with a few others. Sad to see.

1597~~~
shit in this match

1598~~~
It's actually sad to see a player as naturally positive as him playing conservatively. He'd flourish under someone like Klopp. His work rate, technique and affinity for risk taking are tailor made for a high octane counter attacking team.

1599~~~
Big fan of his but he was just as bad as anyone bar Mata today. Today and Stoke are easily his worst two performances for us.

1600~~~
He's getting worse, as is everyone else. It's obviously due to the training/tactics/mentality that is being employed.

1601~~~
His golden chance to stake his claim in the XI but he failed miserably.

1602~~~
I was surprised at the timing of his substitution actually. He was certainly very poor in the first half and I wouldn't bat an eyelid if he was taken off during the break. He started the 2nd half very well though. A lot of pressing, was quick to move the ball forward and I thought our best player in the 15minutes til he was substituted. That's one thing I don't get about LVG recently. He seems to keep taking off the player I least expect him to whenever a substitution is made.

1603~~~
I was surprised he started with Fellaini. I thought it would have been BFS and Herrera with Pereira playing where Ander played. Two holding midfielders against a Sheffield United side who offered nothing was madness. What idea does that put in the players heads. That the game will be more difficult than it was. Then when he made the subs I thought Mata and Fellaini would come off. Ander was not good yesterday, but Mata has been bad the whole season. This manager has no idea where to play his players or even seems to know what their best qualities are.

1604~~~
As much as I agree with what you are saying Herrera should have played better. The guy gets better every match he doesn't play. He has had enough chances time to start producing imo.

1605~~~
I am not arguing that he should have played better. He has been very sporadic. Did well against Everton and then against Watford and got injured. I think he needs consistancy, but there is a deeper problem with the whole team and that is down to the manager. United know what this lad is about that is why we went after him. So why does this manager insist on trying to change every player he buys. Just play to their strengths you bloody clown. If LvG stays I doubt we will sign any decent players. Who would want to play for him and foreign players must be getting feedback from our players when they go home. Not about the club, I think they all love the fans and the club, but about the manager and his coaches.

1606~~~
Responding to Scholes' comment yesterday: what <i><b>is</b></i> his actual position?

1607~~~
In LvG's setup, goodness knows. This setup just isn't working. Isn't he a No.8 who can play at 10 at a push? This is what I mean about not playing players in the positions to get the best out of them. He played in a side who hunted in packs. Problem here is that his teammates are either too slow to do that or on their last legs. They actually need another midfielder who can join in and a No.10 who can as well. As someone said a counter attacking side. Which with a couple of quick wingers we could be. Just not with LvG. A good attacking RB would be needed as well. Shaw is capable of overlapping on the other side, but unfortunately Darmian isn't.

1608~~~
But isn't an 8 supposed to be capable of playing in a midfield 2? which he hasn't been able to. And if everyone is suggesting he isn't a number 10 either, where the feck does he play?

1609~~~
He had the same problem at Athletic Club. Moved between two positions without really being able to nail down one role (Bielsa and Valverde preferring him in different areas). 

It's not really a van Gaal thing in this case. He basically needs a lot of freedom without having the quality to be afforded that luxury.

1610~~~
What set up in midfield did Bilbao have? It may have been that both of them, hunted players down together. I don't think Bilbao have ever been bothered about conceding as long as they get more. I am only going on what other people have said. We are too concerned about not conceding first that attacking is a sideline.

1611~~~
he can play at 8 but not consistently well. That is all. He will have a very good game here and there but his problem is consistency. I dont think his problem has anything to do with the system. He just isnt as good as people here think (that is there is no way Barca or Pep will buy him) but still a good player to have in your squad.

1612~~~
If we had got a Gundogan or a top midfielder and he had strengthen the squad in numbers as he should have then Ander likely would be a squad player, we would be in a position to rotate with quality and would be getting more out of everyone. The problem we have is it always seems there is either someone injured or coming back from injury and have to resort to kids who are not up to it as yet. We might be over doing the praise for him, but the same counts for the kids who are getting praised to the heavens, are not that good but I suspect think they are.

1613~~~
Yes thats a point to be fair. A player like Gundogan or Kroos would bring the better out of him. Ideally, Mata Rooney should be doing that. But hey. We alll know how thats going

1614~~~
Was he with Javi Martinez at Bilbao? I know he played midfield and CB. Pity SAF didn't go in and get both straight away. Instead we dithered. Martinez went off to Bayern to spend most of his time injured and it took ages to get Ander. If Moyes hadn't dithered he might have had that extra year to settle before the turmoil.

1615~~~
As far as I remember, when Javi Martínez was there, they played together with Iturraspe. That was 4 or 5 years ago so could be wrong. He definitely made a switch from number 8 under Bielsa to number 10 under Valverde though.

1616~~~
Crikey Herrera seems to be the fittest of the three, as Martinez and Iturraspe have both been plagued by injury.

1617~~~
Sadly he and Mata seem to have lost any spark they had, there seems to be a bad case of Rooneytanidis flowing through the squad.. And that Surgeon General Dr Louis Van Gaal seems out of ideas how to cure it.  Just a couple seem immune to that with Smalling and De Gea as our only hope.. Dark days are surely at Old Trafford these days.

1618~~~
Given his skillset, and given our midfield issues since his arrival, if he is unable to hold down a place in the base of that midfield then i doubt he's good enough, he's certainly proved he's not good enough to be a top teams no.10, so it leaves the question of where does he actually fit in once again. another 31m bench player.

1619~~~
He is suited to a team that plays a good defensive midfielder behind him and has an attacking midfielder in front of him and width outside of him. He's a link up man, a no.8 in a midfield 3.

1620~~~
But surely that is the way we have set up in the past and it was still shit. I think the fannying around about minute positional details is sugercoating the fact he hasn't been anywhere near good enough in any position over any consistent period. 

I get that a load of players are playing within themselves and the coaching staff is a massive problem right now, but if a lot of these players were half as good as we seem to think they are cracked up to be they would at least be showing more glimpses of their ability, like Martial, smalling, schneiderlin and De gea are doing.

1621~~~
Problem is he has Rooney in front of him. We all know we need the wide men. I was surprised at LvG's comments about wingers yesterday. If I was Mata I would be worried. Yet he left Young out completely and Memphis and Lingard on the bench, they would have been an outlet for BFS and Herrera. There was no need for Fellaini yesterday.

1622~~~
Wish we had build on the triangle from last season with Carrick - Herrera - Fellaini. Instead of Schneiderlin we should have bought a creative midfielder to partner Herrera with.
He was doing fantastic in the run we had last year, really looked like a top midfielder and the misplaced passes seemed to vanish as he got played consistently. I have defended LvG alot on some points, but the decision to change to a 2 man midfield was annoying as we now don't know where to fit in Herrera, a man we bought for 30m, not a small amount.

When we search for a new manager i hope we have someone in mind that knows how to use a player like Herrera to his full strenght, technical players like him is what i want to see in a United side.

1623~~~
He was bad again. Im a fan but its really time to stop blaming Rooney and Depay all the time.

Herrera, BFS, Mata and Fellaini have been just as bad and lately worse as Rooney has improved a bit.

Im also sick of hearing about how Herrera or other players would be better under Klopp. feck KLOPP. He chose Liverpool so feck him. He will never manage here. And he is also showing himself to be a douchebag too.

1624~~~
Agree the golden one is playing just as bad as anyone else in the team. I'm amazed at how much of a free ride he gets. Really nice guy etc etc etc, but hasn't performed at a consistent high level since he joined the club.

1625~~~
Has been crap lately, though he is one of the few players who i will find excuses for because i think he's undoubtedly talented.

1626~~~
He hasn't been that good in the last two games I watched him. He still doesn't look match sharp. And his passing is waywayrd (that has always been a part of his game actually, but atleast he takes such risks).I know people on here say he works best as an 8 in a midfield 3, but I think he can do just as good a job in a midfield 2 as well. The key is to complement him with the right player.

The way I see it, he can thrive with either one of the two types of midfielders.
1)Someone who will press really high up and offer the same level of high energy as Herrera. This can be really devastating, if successful. But on the flip side, if a team manages to break free from the shackles, our CB's will be heavily exposed and we could easily concede a goal.
Ideal Player from our team: Morgan Schneiderlin
Ideal Player in general: Verrati
Realistic Player in general: Gundogan/Sven Bender (Is he actually getting much game time these days ?)

2) Allowing Herrera to press against the midfielders and having an intelligent player behind him to complement him who can anticipate the opposition passes and intercept at will. His positioning (not Herrera) will be key here. As he will be able to quickly retain possession and recycle the ball into Herrera's feet (who usually does well in tight spaces, better than Mata anyway) and who is further forward.
Ideal Player from our team: Daley Blind
Ideal Player in general: Busquets
Realistic Player in general: I can't think of anyone actually.

Ideally, I prefer the first even if it comes with some risk. High Energy and quick circulation of the ball is what we need.

1627~~~
His concentration level needs to become much better and nowadays he floats around and sprays it side ways. His passing is just not good enough right now

1628~~~
Playing really well. Some exquisite passes.

1629~~~
Keeping things ticking today

1630~~~
Didn't deserve to keep his place in the team but I'm glad he did. Much better today.

1631~~~
His weight of pass has been brilliant. Finding space well in this game.

1632~~~
My thoughts exactly. I'd predicted Mata would take his role, but I suppose he didn't do any more to deserve that spot.

1633~~~
He's been excellent today.

1634~~~
Great to see him play well.

1635~~~
On point today. Well played.

1636~~~
Please for the lad today. He was one of the main reasons we were 2-0 up. Let him do that to Liverpool on Sunday as well.

1637~~~
Looked quite good, had some nice passes and touches. Should've probably stayed on.

1638~~~
He'd have scored that Fellaini header.

1639~~~
Probably. If he'd been the only one on a yellow then I'd have understood it a bit more, but there was no reason for taking him off instead of Fellaini, who's more rash than Herrera.

1640~~~
Too good to remain on the pitch for the full 90 minutes.

1641~~~
He was very good in the first half but I didn't notice his presence as much in the second. Still, better than last few games.

1642~~~
Better.

1643~~~
The substitution made zero sense. Mata barely even saw the ball when he replaced him.

1644~~~
Him and Martial laid on the sitter for Jesse, probably took him off because Jesse didn't score.

1645~~~
Catalyst for everything that was good in the first half. Simply overrun in the second.

1646~~~
Faded a bit but that was his best performance this season in the #10 role IMO.

1647~~~
He came out of this game with a lot of credit. The defence was atrocious, Morgan was bad tonight, but was that rustiness. Fellaini needs to go. I was actually happy for Wayne.

1648~~~
I thought Ander's movement off the ball and incisiveness on it were a real highlight of the performance.

1649~~~
He just had to start against Liverpool. If Fellaini does I will scream. The way our defence is though not sure anything will make a difference.

1650~~~
Much better today.

1651~~~
Was very good today. Have no idea why he was taken off.

1652~~~
Great but did fade quite a bit and looked shot. 

Hopefully he can turn up again at Anfield like last year.

1653~~~
God knows. Mata was dynamic when he came on. Not.

1654~~~
The lad worked really hard. Hopefully he is starting to build his fitness back up.

1655~~~
you dont bench captain fantastic right? if we speculate a bit if ander stayed on the pitch Martial would go up front, Ander might not score like rooney did into top corner but Martial being up top would make much more problems than rooney, he would go past collocini with ease and slot it past keeper, rooney also had another good chance which with a bit more space and actual technique could have converted so I am sure we would score anyway but its all if, I was surprised that Ander got on the pitch in the first place as he didnt have a good game last term but it was refreshing to see a palyer who likes to play quick football make runs etc, blatant decision to let fellaini on the pitch and start him in the first place ahead of pereira who could have combine much better in that area and help to organize the passing game so we would be much more in control but fellaini's ther for his height isnt he, so he can score headers:-)

1656~~~

1657~~~
I still think he goes back too much. If his first instinct every time he got the ball was to move forward with it, he would look much better.

He is brilliant of the ball though.

1658~~~
Because he was gassed, that's why.

1659~~~
It's really frustrating that we just can't play him alongside Schneiderlin with a license to break forward for a run of games. Fellaini is allowed to do that yet struggles to link up well, Herrera can get forward and will get back as well.

1660~~~
Not sure why LVG cant just have him and Morgan + 1 other in a midfield three (ideally carrick or basti or them switching) where him and Morgan do not come off unless we are 2 goals up or necessity.

1661~~~
LVG's dislike of Herrera is baffling at times.
Our best player bar Rooney. But yet Fellaini stays on. He must really hate clever footballers, I guess he wouldn't like Scholes much either. But Herrera must pray for LVG to be sacked asap, I just hope we get a manager in that helps to settle little gems like Herrera.

1662~~~
I just can't fathom how we've invested so much in midfield yet end up in a situation at the moment where the best passer behind the attackers is far too often Blind at CB.

1663~~~
I didn't see that at all. What we saw was a player getting completely messed around by the two dms who did absolutely nonthing and couldn't keep the ball for more than 2 seconds.

1664~~~
Herrera started the move for Lingards goal and Lingards miss. He was one of the pluses tonight. Morgan, Fellaini and the defence bar DDG were one massive minus. There again having Fellaini next to you in midfield would put anyone off.

1665~~~
TBh, weve not invested well for a number of years, including fergies last years. Maybe even since 2008

1666~~~
Cracking player. Shows real intelligence at times. Very neat and tidy. Was the fulcrum of the attack last night with everything moving around him. He does have a tendency to fade at times in games and he can get overrun, but when he's already done the business as per last nights chances created, how can we moan. He's one of very few United players to make things happen. Long may his run in the team continue.

1667~~~
Was good yesterday. Passing was incisive and was good off the ball too. But he has to stop conceding needless freekicks in dangerous areas.

1668~~~
Hasn't been the same since coming back from his injury. He's shown at times a maniacal appetite to kick lumps out the opposition, I like.

1669~~~
Is fellaini your favourite player then?

1670~~~
Has nothing to do with the injury though, if that is what you are implying here. He was sitting for weeks on the bench. He obviously changed his style to please LvG

1671~~~
I just wonder if this is a Spanish thing. When you follow games there seems to be foul after foul. That is the way they stop people. I wonder if anyone is a expert on this.

1672~~~
Difference between Fellaini and Herrera is that Fellaini is crap and fouling is about all he can do. The fouling aspect is just one side to Herrera's game which is accompanied by very good technical ability. Herrera is a player that can foul, Fellaini is a foul awaiting a player.

1673~~~
There's something to what you saying but I also think the lay off affected him.

1674~~~
Weeks? He got injured vs Watford on Nov 21. Before that he started vs Everton on Oct 18, CSKA on Oct 21 City Oct 26 , Palace on Oct 31 and was benched vs West Brom on Nov 8 and home to CSKA on Nov 5 alone. A week at max on the bench. Since his return he played every game iirc including the sheff united game.

He gives Fks in dangerous positions though. I wouldnt mind him making small fouls like Morgan does far away

1675~~~
The big guy is just clumsy to be fair. There's something sinister about some of Ander's challenges. The dark arts.

1676~~~
My favourite United player right now. His ability to set the stage for others to get the job done.
My only issue is his tendency to hit the deck, no wonder he can't last 90 mins. For a pro he should know this.

1677~~~
Ya can't judge any player atm because we are all over the place.

1678~~~
Need to him to run the show against Liverpool again.

1679~~~
That's true however whilst with Fergie we all know it was frustrating but ultimately he delivered over that period although perhaps had we shown the same appetite to spend then as we have recently who knows where we'd be.

But with LVG he's spent big and it feels very much that it's his questionable choices with his selections that are causing issues in the middle (as opposed to Fergie's odd view of the value in the market), such as being overly defensive in the middle in some games and most annoyingly for me, now that we have a proper DM in Schneiderlin who can screen the defence well just being so unwilling to give Herrera and extended run there which could help so much with moving the ball well. I'm not saying Herrera is great or anything but he's a useful player who can bring more out of others with his energy, quick and intelligent not to mention ambitious passing.

That's what's so annoying, whist there are problems in the squad I just can't see how an extended run of schneiderlin, herrera and mata centrally, martial, rooney and Depay/lingard couldn't play some decent stuff and is generally quite a complimentary side.

1680~~~
He probably hated Iniesta and Xavi too.

1681~~~
TBH Herrera looked like he ran out of gas

1682~~~
he's still building his fittness after injury but if Fellaini wasnt so awful covering ground and Morgan imposed more on the game, would never happened

1683~~~
Did Schmeichel just say Herrera doesn't pass forward

1684~~~
Why is keep turning back? One of the best things about his game last season  was positive he was.

1685~~~
Garbage from him in the first half, up there with Lingard as our worst player.

1686~~~
Under LVG passing the ball forward is too risky.

1687~~~
Come on to feck I'm not saying you don't have a little truth but surely Herrera needs to be better?

1688~~~
He's a decent player, however nowhere near good enough.

1689~~~
Didn't really notice him that half.

1690~~~
Really? He is being outplayed end off. How is the manager blamed for his limp display today.

1691~~~
No options, perhaps. The gaps between midfield and attack are enormous. Liverpool are everywhere and we're not showing for the ball. rooney and Fellaini are too immobile to show for a pass, and Lingard and Martial look pinned to the sidelines.

Herrera hasn't been good, but I don't think he has done <i>too </i>much wrong. As a team, we are just offering nothing today. No runs, no support from the midfield. I can't see where a goal could possibly come from today.

1692~~~
Kagawa?

1693~~~
Come on Ander you can do better. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1694~~~
We could post this in every player performance thread, but honestly I think it will be a struggle for all of them with how were playing.
It seems like were set up to not lose rather than win.

1695~~~
Ive been thinking this very same thing in the last 3 months or so. He turns back or plays a square at nearly every opportunity now. You cant do that if you are meant to be the main creator of the team (number 10 role).

1696~~~
He is far from our worst players, and definitely much better in first half than his midfield partners.

1697~~~
fellaini has been comfortably better than any of schneiderlin or herrera. At least he tried ssomethin

1698~~~
Painfully average. Bilbao rinsed us good.

1699~~~
I thought he was supposed to be a good passer? What the hell

1700~~~
Ander is one of the few players we have who really does suffer because of the way LVG sets us up and wants us to play.

1701~~~
He was rubbish today.

1702~~~
Bet you weren't saying that after the Liverpool game last year. He was bad today. Don't care we won.

1703~~~
He plays far too fast and hectic, taking direct shots and playing passes while still stumbling around. Should take a deep breath and look for composure.

1704~~~
Once we started playing with more tempo second half I thought he was our best midfielder. Still shit, but it was a poor showing from everybody.

1705~~~
He was great against Newcastle, so he picks the same side and instead of playing the same way, goes cautious. We won, so this time I don't really care. The spirit in this team is good. I like that they are still tight despite all the criticism. A lot of teams would be at each others throats in these circumstances.

1706~~~
Should have done better. But we won in the end so I don't really care in the end.

His celebrations are amazing.

1707~~~
We should have him as a cheerleader. Can you imagine if he had been in that stand?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1708~~~
I thought he was industrious like Fellaini but offered nothing on the ball.

1709~~~
I like Ander but he was very poor today, looked slow and weak and passed back way too often. Maybe it's van gaals instructions but he must be more confident going forward and get involved in the game

1710~~~
Ignore the manager you mean?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1711~~~
His problems today weren't even anything to do with instructions. His passing was just quite poor in general, and I'm going to guess that even LVG isn't telling him to intentionally misplace passes.

1712~~~
You're right, I wasn't.

But a year is a long time and what I've seen since then hasn't impressed.

1713~~~
Maybe he had a system that suited the lad and brought out the best in him. Then for some reason decides, no that didn't work, when it did and we are playing terribly and Ander suffers for it. He must be the player in the side who has had to learn more new ways of playing that anyone else. I think he plays well against the sides who have a go. Liverpool were not as open as Newcastle and he showed what he can do against Everton. I think sometimes LvG sends his sides out to be hard to beat. There were only a few players who were good today.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1716~~~
He's such a fan of football though too. Some of the best interviews he's done you can sense his passion for the sport and certain clubs. He lives for it.

1717~~~
In that video he did with Mata recently Mata said that Herrera will literally watch 2 or 3 games in a row in an evening for fun, he bloody loves it

1718~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I can't stop watching Herrera run past there

1719~~~
I can just imagine sat at home watching Barcelona/Bilbao this very minute. He admitted he cries watching Messi.

1720~~~
I can't stop watching Van Gaal, rushing to write something down. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1721~~~
I know, what the hell would he be thinking about writing at that moment?

1722~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Love it.

1723~~~
Hes not good enough to start for us. Just another average player in an average squad.

EDIT: hes not good enough to start for a team who genuinely wants to win the league.

1724~~~
Surprisingly poor today. Big drop from his Newcastle performance. Still think he's our best number 10, even though I'd prefer him a bit deeper.

1725~~~
Thought he was poor today. No amount of wild celebrations will change that. Too often he gives the ball away in areas where there's little to be gained and lots to be lost. All that said I'd play him every week and work from there.

1726~~~
GOAL!

I don't know. It's like those club representatives writing stuff down during european competition draws. "Write down we got Lyon, so we remember and don't get cheated afterwards by being given a tie against Barcelona".

1727~~~
I am sorry to say but he's got LVG'd. Sometimes he did get the ball in the final third when he turned around and passed it back. Just look at the recent attempted through balls and compare them to last year. Yes, he has been poor lately but I'd also point fingers at the coaching staff and overall play.

1728~~~
Agree with Rick on this point.  Before LVG tightened the noose around everyone's neck Herrera was our best passer, by far, on the squad.  He was even looking a bit Scholesy.  But now you can see that he's been trained to pull the ball back into the safest pass possible instead of taking a chance with a risky cutting pass.

We all get why...LVG hates losing possession.  And there's even some good reason for that.  Our back line is built on egg shells -- Young at right back to start, Blind at CB and Darmian out at LB and Smalling is prone to mind-farts.  All that save us from a potential blowout every week is De Gea and our possession game.  And Ander is the kind of player who not run afoul of a manager's instructions.  At least not after the beat down he took last season when his free flowing passing style only bought him a long benching.

1729~~~
He's making a tally chart of our chance:conversion ratio, so he can remind the post-match interviewer if we did or did not take our chances.

1730~~~
Amazing he doesn't have crayons to colour a graph in.

1731~~~
He's been pretty shite recently. Big big fan of him, think we're a better team with him but I think it's obvious that he's a much better player in that role he played last season. As a no.10, he just doesn't have enough of a full package to pull the strings further forward.

1732~~~
With the amount he complicates the lineups and tactics, I'd hate to see how complicated his graphs are <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I bet at school he was that one kid that brought a full on pencil case with compass, protractor and 13 different pens to a multiple choice exam.

1733~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1734~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He never had the range in his passing. And he always had a tendency to give it away cheaply or needlessly.

Also, for all the talk about him being such a positive player, the amount of times when he's in acres of space and he just passes it straight back is quite amazing. The Spanish Cleverley is actually a good comparison.

I like the guy, but eventually his role should be that of a squad player.

1735~~~
This 

As we've seen, Herrera's best games are usually when he's reckless and care free. Stifling him in name of possession is killing Herrera. Risky play will mean he would lose possession a lot but that is fine if he plays his best. I remember last season when LvG came to say that he tried to talk Herrera out of closing his eyes when taking a shot at goal. What? He had just scored like 6 goals in limited playing time, most of them crackers. LvG is trying to process the hell out of this guy. He is still a brilliant player when he is unshackled.

1736~~~
Sad part about it is that is actually true.

1737~~~
I don't see how anyone can blame herrera. He never got the ball in a good position. The two dms couldn't keep the ball for more than two seconds. Never a quick forward ball into him to play anyone in. It was ridiculous. What's a 10 supposed to do without the ball?

1738~~~
He was pretty poor. We won so it doesn't really matter, if we had lost though he would have been one of the most criticised. Just didn't seem to do anything.

1739~~~
I think Herrera is overrated, but this comparison will always be a terrible one.

1740~~~
Still maintain that #10 isn't his position. Until Bastian/Carrick are fit I'd like to see him deeper next to Morgan.

1741~~~
Why is that?

1742~~~
Cut his hair and his play has gone to shit a bit.

1743~~~
The issue everyone seem to ignore about Herrera is lack of tactical awareness. For a midfielder being able to operate within varying tempo should be key. The only time he seem to standout is when it an end to end display. LVG is right to coach the recklessness out of his game, name one top performing club that'll accept such displays.
I personally like him because tends to make the attack purposeful but as a midfielder he should have a better control of him game. Against Liverpool he gave he usual energetic display but was littered with errors that could have been costly and if we think LVG shouldn't frown on this then we are supporting the wrong club.

1744~~~
It's weird because having learned under Bielsa you'd expect him to be more intelligent, off the ball especially.

1745~~~
Bielsa seems to play high intensity football as far I can remember and that suited him. It's beautiful to watch but when competing at the top end of the table variation is necessary because your prime responsibility is not to suffocate the opponent but impose yourself.
Then again most fans prefer United setting up to suffocate.

1746~~~
Am I the only one who things it would serve him well to bulk up a bit? He looks so lightweight compared to other central midfielders.

1747~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1748~~~
Love the guy but he's in drop able form.

1749~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Such a likeable player. I hope he finds some form soon though as LVG could justifiably drop him based on recent performances.

1750~~~
Hes been at his best when he is linking up with Mata.

Would really like to see a midfield with him and Mata with  Schneiderlin just sitting and play proper wingers

1751~~~
Don't think that's really a problem, we're not playing him at central midfield often anyway. I don't know into what type of player he'll eventually develop but right now the main attributes which make him special are his agility and his acceleration combined with his aggressiveness and the tendency he has to press high, close down the first attacker and regain possession. It would be a gamble to send him to the gym because if he gains muscle weight, he might lose all of that. And he doesn't seem to me like a ball carrier or good at organizing plays from a deeper role like Schweinsteiger was when LvG tried him in a deeper role at Bayern. I'd rather focus on his positioning and his off the ball movement in the attacking half.

1752~~~
Rubbish first half. For me, he's the new Kagawa on here, people think he's phenomenal for some reason I can't fathom. Has his moments at times, but maddeningly inconsistent. Any one of that midfield trio ... actually scratch that, basically anyone on the park could be replaced.

1753~~~
Lucky not to concede a penalty for his stupidity on that corner

1754~~~
Wonder what is happening to him. Looks lost at times.

1755~~~
Not on his best but he's the only one on the pitch trying to do something. Some fancy flicks and some embarrassing passes.

1756~~~
He is starting to look more and more like Mata, some quality moments here and there but for 95% of the time he has no influence on the game.

1757~~~
He's gone to shite too, now.

1758~~~
He can't play behind a striker. He's not creative enough and doesn't score enough goals. He's a fecking midfielder.

1759~~~
Why are people repeating this?

Where did you read anyone calling him phenomenal, especially judging his performances this season? 

Even his biggest fans admit he is really poor this season.

1760~~~
Needs Juan in the team to link up with. Simply put, no other players in our squad offer him the same combination passes and build up play. He's suffering without Mata.

1761~~~
Ridiculous what he did in that Southampton corner, has been so unconvincing behind a striker.

1762~~~
He isn't a ten.

1763~~~
Yep. When Mata and him play there we actually have people who play through the midfield. When Fellaini plays there we seem to skip that out completely.

1764~~~
Around 30th minute he got shoved off by one of their players like he was 10 indeed though.

He needs to gain some muscle mass the lad and grow afro hair.

1765~~~
Maybe I haven't come into this thread much recently, but people used be constantly moaning when he was left out, lamenting that he'd leave etc. Perhaps I'm behind the times? I never saw it at the time, even when he was playing relatively OK, and I certainly don't see it now.

1766~~~
I loved him last season but his fandom is fast reaching Kagawa levels of stupidity. There's always an excuse for why he's shit.

1767~~~
I thought he was terrible in the first half but better when moved into the double pivot, he needs to slow down at times though.

1768~~~
Very poor once again.

1769~~~
You can't even use that excuse anymore. They've played loads of times together lately and they've both been rubbish.

1770~~~
Was today the day when we saw Ander finally succumb to the dark side and go full negative?

1771~~~
Sadly I'm beginning to come around to that idea. Oh Ander.

1772~~~
Yeah, starting to become obvious he isn't good enough for where United need to be. Same as his best mate, Mata. He's at that level where he should be playing for Tottenham, and 40% of the 'caf would be desperate for him, and 60% would think he's 'Tottenham level' and the club could do better.

And the truth is: Herrera would probably not be a favorite of Guardiola or Mourinho, for a few reasons. It just doesn't seem like he's going to be here very long, in my opinion. Klopp would have been a good manager for him, but the two mentioned above.. I just don't see how Herrera fits their respective styles.

1773~~~
There is no way he or anyone else of our midfielders would get into the current Tottenham starting eleven, Eriksen, Alli and Dier are currently playing at a much higher level than anyone of our midfielders.

1774~~~
He's a bit shit.  Seems like a sound fella though.

1775~~~
I think he's just suffering in the style as is everyone else. He's shown before that he's far better then what he's doing now, as everyone else is. He's a brilliant player at his best. Just needs to give him the freedom to take risks with his passing again like when he first came. Van Gaal has basically coached it out of him in order to play him. Not saying he would be starting at the best teams around, but Madrid, Barca and Bayern would all use him as squad players for sure. 

Also, he's not a #10 nor a defensive mid. He's a proper central midfielder and needs to play as one. Also why would Mourinho or Guardiola not like him? If anything, I think they'd both love him. He's got an excellent touch on the ball, is a very quick thinker, a good passer and one that is very much suited to play a quick passing game, has a great work rate and isn't afraid to get stuck in, can be creative (or was when he played his natural game, not what Van Gaal is forcing him to do), and can score goals.

1776~~~
Everyone in the team has been shite. People need to stop fecking making these rash decisions on the players or saying they're not good enough. It's all on the manager. He's the one who has fecked up the performances of every single attack minded player we've had in the last 20 months, he's the one who tells them what they can and can't do, where they need to play, and how to play. Herrera was great in the second half of last season, when played in his proper position (as a center mid). He's not a holding midfielder, nor is he a #10 in a 4-2-3-1 system, especially not when there is no attacking intent anywhere else in the team.

1777~~~
Absolutely agree with you there mate.

1778~~~
lol I think you are even worse when it comes to Fellaini than Walrus.

1779~~~
Very sad to hear that, I think very highly of you.

1780~~~
The way people want to ditch players we will be in a worse position next season. Spend all summer trying to flog players and leave us with no time to replace them. We will be lucky to scrape a side together. We are desperately short of players, we need more players. Yes get rid of Fellaini. Maybe even Mata, let Carrick retire and get some real quality in to use with the ones left. Unfortunately this manager will leave us in such a position it might be impossible to sign top quality. God help us if he is here next season as well. No player in their right minds will sign for us at the moment. He knew we were short in certain areas and he did nothing or Ed did nothing. Those two have a lot to answer for.

1781~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Excellent, love this!

1782~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1783~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well the difference is I've been saying that about Fellaini since he was at Everton when he was arguably my least favourite player around. I've been pretty consistent in my opinion on him. Anyone can see that herrera has more talent in his little toe then Fellaini has.

1784~~~
How many of these combinations over the years have led to goals or chance. They all seem to be some fanciful little passes within a square without moving forward. I know they are beautiful to watch but are they as productive together, seeing during that better run last season it was the left area causing all the problems.
Don't get me wrong I personally like him as a player(10) but the arguments at times don't lend to facts on the pitch.

1785~~~
Big fan but another shit game.

1786~~~
The only manager he has played under here is LvG. I would prefer to see what happens with most of our players with another manager. I still think the manager and his tactics are the problem. All the players are going to rubbish. The only ones playing well are DDG and CBJ. The latter is just a kid and eventually he even manages to mess with their heads. Even Smalling isn't playing as well.

1787~~~
I am hurt <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1788~~~
He's not good enough to start for a team at a level we aspire to return too.

He's Ramsey without the goals. Half the player.

Bare in mind when everyone's fit Ramsey is out on the right, not in midfield. Yet this fella is supposedly a top midfielder LvG is hiding? 

He's energetic and "gets the club". That's what Liverpool fans get laughed at for their praise of Henderson. 

What does Herrera offer? Where is this player who is seen as a saviour?

1789~~~
But he was good last year and scored more than his fair share.

He has been unbelievably sideways and negative this season. But yet, he is playing every week now so LVG must fancy this version of him.

The good Ander last season couldn't hold down a place, this shit version is getting game time. LVG eh...

1790~~~
The spanish Tom cleverly. Just to not get banned, ill hide my feelings for now.

1791~~~
Not sure what you thought he was going to be? He was never going to be the main man, but we didn't sign a midfield main man. Also if you think the players we need to get to the top will sign for us, think again. That is going to be a progessive thing and thanks to this manager and his tactics and liking a small squad, so players get shunted all over the place to cover for his transfer deficiencies the progress has been backwards not forwards. That is down to our egotistical manager and C.E.O. I wonder if WonderED will dare come out with any stupid loadsamoney statements this summer.

1792~~~
I think lots on here would accept he should be a squad player for us in the long term.

1793~~~
I wouldn't be too surprised if he thought he was. He has always said he knows it is a squad game here and that he would try to do his best. I think he tries but this manager as someone said prefers the awful way he plays now to the joy he was last season. That say everything about the manager.

1794~~~
The most overrated player on the cafe.

I saw a few people say he'd get in the Barcelona team.

1795~~~
Rakitic isnt much better and plays regularly for Barca. The difference is Barcelona dont expect much creativity/goals from Rakitic, we expect more from Ander.

1796~~~
I expected Ander to be more the one who runs around and harasses people into mistakes for a main midfielder to be the creative hub. That is how he started, running after the ball, hassling the opposition, then LvG told him to stop doing it. You actually need someone like that, so your midfield doesn't get waltzed through. LvG just wanted us to keep the ball. I like a terrier in midfield.

1797~~~
He'd be a very good squad player for them, he wouldn't be a consistent starter. And that's why they were interested in him in the past. He'd fit in perfectly in their style.

1798~~~
That's exactly what I expected and wanted too. 

It actually baffles me to think what we would have done with Vidal had we signed him.

1799~~~
His game has dropped rather considerably, but I still think there are many in the side who need to be shown the door before we consider booting Herrera.

1800~~~
Rakitic is definitely better than Ander. 

And I consider Rakitic pretty overrated too.

1801~~~
so we have a player regressing from what he originally showed? hmmm

1802~~~
Our transfer policy seems to be to deliver the aperitif but not the main course. Ander was part of the midfield jigsaw but the club have failed miserably with the rest of the midfield recruits attacking wise. BFS is not the answer, we needed someone, as you say like a Vidal, who is in their prime and would form a long standing partnership. Instead Morgan is taking time to settle, Carrick is nearing the end and tbh BFS is not far off.

1803~~~
Christ. You still believe the rumours that they wanted Ander? He wouldn't fit their style because he's not intelligent enough, he still hasn't learned when to slow the game down, when to hold back instead of pressing.

1804~~~
Can someone tell me what it is he actually does? He can pass, but not particularly well, he can sort of tackle, and he's sort of a headless chicken.

Is he literally just our Jordan Henderson? A 6/10 player who runs about a lot rather aimlessly as his best attribute? Because although he had good form for us last season at times, I don't see a future for a midfielder with his skillset at a top club.

1805~~~
This isn't against Ander personally, because it isn't his fault, but why is there a section of the crowd that cheer everything he does? Even when he gets subbed off he gets this huge ovation - despite being very average all game. 

Anyway, pretty meh performance. He's vastly overrated on here.

1806~~~
This. Its the same pattern for every player we've signed over the last two seasons.

1807~~~
last year he was one of our best players and had a bit of everything we needed in a midfielder. Tenacious, energetic and an eye for goal. This year it seems he just does the basics, admittedly poor at times but I guess fans feel he is a bit restricted

edit; maybe what the fans like about him is what LVG doesn't like

1808~~~
Back to your regular haircut and you will be fine Ander.

1809~~~
Kinda what I was thinking <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Another player who I dont know what their best position is because they are playing in different areas meaning average at everything but not great (specializing) in one thing.

1810~~~
You know what pissed me off more then it should have? He should have taken Mane out on the half way line, taking a booking... its just what you do in that situation.

1811~~~
From the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Handbook 1998<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1812~~~
He's a good player, when the change in management eventually comes he will thrive I'm sure of it.

1813~~~
Came in with the team buzzing and cruising, and still found a way to play backward passes and loose balls.

Sort it out Ander!!

1814~~~
I wonder if he'll start against Chelsea with Fellaini injured.

1815~~~
I would have said Morgan, but Morgan has not been great, so maybe.

1816~~~
I think both are more careless on the ball than LvG likes but it depends on if he wants the extra attacking threat, away to Chelsea I think you might be right and he'll opt for the more defensive CM in Schneidelrin.

1817~~~
That's my thinking. Ander is careless because he tries things, Morgan has just been careless or maybe more losing concentration.

1818~~~
We need both to step between now and the end of the season, our midfield relies too much on Carrick, who while still quality on the ball has very limited mobility now.

1819~~~
If we go on a good run of games I think the confidence will come to all the players. All the booing and negativity can't have helped their play. I just hope the game at Chelsea goes well for the team. Last couple of games there have been good signs. Even when we have been getting results the performances have still been off. Last two games have been refreshing.

1820~~~
Yeah, we need to stop the trend of 1 step forward, 2 steps back, unfortunately it might still be too late IMO, neither Spurs or Leicester look like falling apart to me.

1821~~~
We might catch Arsenal yet. I don't think anyone could anticipate how Leicester and Spurs would perform.

1822~~~
There is no way that Schneiderlin can replace Carrick. He just isn't good enough or confident enough.

1823~~~
He needs to get his confidence back and get a feeling of freedom again. He showed in the past how good he can be, but lately, even today in the little bit of time he played, he just turns back and passes back. From taking too much risks on the ball to now playing it safe always. He has it in him, just needs to find the balance.

1824~~~
For me it's about encouraging him to run forwards into space with the ball when the chance is available.  He seems to have really taken this possession thing to heart.  My memory of him at Bilbao is vague but I seem to recall that he is capable of 'attacking the space' much more than he's shown for us.  He has the vision and execution to hurt teams but has to back teams off more on the ball which in theory should give him more chances to thread those passes through.  Again like with the rest of the team the shackles just have to come off.

To be fair to him, Depay and Pereira they came on at a time when the team had decided the game was done.  I'm still in support of the possession game when we are comfortable and seeing a game out, it comes in useful.

1825~~~
Didnt help that he had plenty of "easy" passes going wrong for him in a short time. Not sure where he could start if not in a 3 men midfield

1826~~~
Seems to of really gone off the boil this season, he isn't even making basic passes. It is quite a concern, but hopefully next season if we get a new manager he will get a consistent run going.

1827~~~
Ander needs to be unbrainwashed. Also it could be a little bit of second season syndrome. If he was bad last season I would be worried, but we know what we can do. He played really well against Everton, then LvG seemed to go back into his shell against City and Palace. Then he was good against Watford and god help us he got injured. It seems to have been a very stop start season tactically and physically for the lad. Other players seem to have a certain role, where he has been not necessarily moved around, more that LvG keeps changing the focus of his role and that cannot help.

1828~~~
He has mostly been played as a CM or a CAM. It doesn't make sense that he can't put in even competent performances playing in roles he has often played. It's absurd to blame van gaal or Woodward or Fellaini or whoever for his struggles

1829~~~
I didn't mention Fellaini and I am not blaming LvG either. Just said he has had to adjust to one minute having to sit back a bit more and other times playing more attacking. You are reading too much into my post.

1830~~~
It wasn't to you Admittedly. I only tagged you because you touched upon it a bit <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>. People give excuse for his games

1. LvG doesn't like him.
2. How can he play well with Fellaini behind and Rooney ahead of him (of late, just Fellaini though)
3. He isn't a 10 (when he is played there)
4. He can't play in a midfield 2 (when he plays there)
5. We don't play 4-3-3 like last season
6. He is held back by LvG

I've read all these by a lot of posters.

1831~~~
Ok.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<b>Ander Herrera: I want to be at Manchester United for a long time, that’s why I’m so passionate when we score
</b>
love the lad

1833~~~
hasn't been good lately but needed to come on today. We had no one that could keep hold of the ball and play a pass in those frantic moments. He's very good at that and his quick feet would have made a difference.

A pretty obvious sub I thought. LVG doesn't rate him. Perhaps wasn't even his signing.

1834~~~
I don't think LvG rates him, at all. Although, he was been poor of late, which could be due to the managers lack of trust. He tends to play a few, get dropped/injured, benched and the cycle restarts.

1835~~~
I mentioned the fact that Ander was asked about Jose and gave an honest answer. LvG probably didn't like that. By the end of the season hopefully none of us will need to worry about LvG and his opinions.

1836~~~
The sooner this clown of a manager goes the better.

1837~~~
I am now at this point too.

1838~~~
Will play soon a few games, then dropped again, play again, dropped again etc...

1839~~~
He will likely play on Thursday and Monday. I would have given him a runout last week with Memphis just to keep his legs moving. I worry when players are on the bench for ages, then are asked to play and promptly get injured.

1840~~~
You think? Louis isn't the master of squad management and rotation, wouldn't surprise me if he played the exact same team that ended the game today, unless someone comes back from injury. He runs the players to the ground until they get injured/lose form, then starts to change things up.

1841~~~
I would say Morgan has already lost form.

1842~~~
Woeful half from him.

1843~~~
He's been useless and should come off for Schneiderlin.

1844~~~
Absolutely terrible<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1845~~~
Having an absolute stinker thus far. I'm a massive fan of his but he hasn't hit the heights of last season at all this year.

1846~~~
Another poor game in what has been a poor season generally from him.

1847~~~
Is quite overrated on here.

1848~~~
Just a smidge.

1849~~~
That cut lip has massively unsettled him. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1850~~~
That turn on like the 21st minute has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. He is played the ball near our box with at least 15 yards of wide open space in front of him and what does he do? A blind turn backwards with some little flick between his legs. First of all wtf is he doing turning backwards when we are playing out of trouble with miles of space in front of him and second who the feck turns like that? Absolutely ridiculous and I hope he gets ripped a new asshole for that. A poor performance is a poor performance but that shit is just straight up idiotic.

1851~~~
I'm shocked.

1852~~~
Said it before the match, Herrera can't play in a 2.

1853~~~
He is no good in front of the back four. It just isn't his position.

1854~~~
As shit as he has been (And by god he's been fecking shite) at least he's visible. Schneiderlin is entirely new levels of shite.

1855~~~
I rolled at my eyes at the moment you described. I mean wtf has happened to our players for them to always be in this "play it behind" mode, it is fecking retarded. Having so much space and turning back <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1856~~~
Yeah, I couldn't help but laugh at that.

1857~~~
Been very poor this season, hoped he'd kick on.

1858~~~
He'll probably be back in Spain within the next three windows.
Not good enough, and few serious managers building a serious teams would rely on him. Maybe just Klopp, at a serious push.

He's suited to frantic, topsy-turvy football. Sadly that isn't what the biggest games/teams/competitions are about.

1859~~~
Presumably he's been LVG'd. So much worse today than he was when we signed him. Looks like a bad version of himself.

1860~~~
Yep, the role we saw him in towards the end of last year is the only one he's particularly good in. Not a #6 and not a #10.

1861~~~
Every single player is regressing.

1862~~~
He's to inconsistent sadly. Doesn't seem to use his head sometimes. I dunno. Let's see what he looks like with a different manager...

1863~~~
Probably. If not for the fact a new manager will come in and our squad is already wafer thin, I'd say he could go this summer. Turn it around, Ander.

1864~~~
Herrera MUST play. I still don't know what nonsense was based on, not just today, he's good, but massively overrated.

1865~~~
I remember a time when he used to give us genuine gif-worthy moments. Now, he's become such a plain vanilla player with no real interesting qualities (on display). Hopefully a new manager brings out the skillful side in him.

1866~~~
He's been shite this season. Had 1 or 2 good games from the top of my head but nothing like the player he was last season.

I hope it's just another victim of the philosophy and he'll return to his best under a new manager.

1867~~~
Worst game in a United shirt.

1868~~~
This is a joke! Get him off the pitch, fecking embarrassment.

1869~~~
he's been turned into tom Cleverley

1870~~~
Get Schneiderlin on he's been dreadful

1871~~~
What a terrible, terrible player for us. Never liked him, and it doesn't seem like he'll win me over. Sell in the summer please.

1872~~~
The mercy sub can't come fast enough. Really bad game today.

1873~~~
A performance of career-ending (at this club) proportions.

You can be sure he won't receive a quarter of the vitriol Fellaini would though.

1874~~~
Worst performance iv seen in a United shirt in a very longtime, and that is seriously saying something.

1875~~~
What has happened to him?

1876~~~
A night to forget for Ander.

1877~~~
Worst player on the pitch today.

1878~~~
He's had a few stinkers since he came here. Seems to be always due one.

Not that he's ever had an 'excellent' game for us in my view.

1879~~~
You never liked him? He has been poor but he was very good last season.

1880~~~
The whole team is shite. It's really hard to judge any individual performance when the team isn't clicking and nothing is really working. Honestly I think Scholes would struggle to make a positive impression in this side.

1881~~~
That was one of the worst performances I've seen for some time. The other CM's are hardly much better though.

1882~~~
Wont start a game anytime soon and rightly so

1883~~~
What on Earth happened to him?

1884~~~
Absolutely ridiculous performance. Hopefully the new manager fecks him off. Frustrating the goodwill he enjoys amongst the United fans.

1885~~~
Doesn't have the passing range or positional ability to play in a two man midfield. Isn't creative enough to be a number ten either. Only looked half decent being played in a three man midfield with license to run around. Hope I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure he'll go down as a poor signing.

1886~~~
Lacking confidence, in a team that's lacking confidence, playing a style of football that doesn't suit him, in a formation that doesn't suit him. Also, was overrated here anyway.

1887~~~
Didn't get any better when he went off. Morgan is as bad. So there is a real problem with this team. It's like they are desperately trying to get the manager the boot.

1888~~~
He's been playing poorly for a while.

1889~~~
True. I'm actually not sure we should read too much into any of the players' performances at this point given the team has obviously collapsed.

1890~~~
He has, but they all have. As I said there are big problems at United and letting this manager finish the season is going to make it worse. The players have lost heart. If Giggs is too above himself to do until the end of the season, let Warren Joyce do it.

1891~~~
Most overrated player in our team by far imo.

Wouldn't be fussed if he was sold.

1892~~~
Never been that impressed by him. But today was absolutely wank.

1893~~~
Been dreadful lately but he's a decent player...his heads gone like most of them.

1894~~~
Even at his best he was a Cleverly with goals. He'd be a decent squad player if we had a better midfield. As it is he's the only player we have in that position with an ounce of attacking ability.

1895~~~
Worst game in a United shirt imo.

1896~~~
He's not suited to the double pivot but that doesn't excuse the rank amateur carelessness over and over tonight, shocking stuff.

1897~~~
This thread is quite funny when you have a look at the "Herrera is the most complete midfielder in the league" thread.

1898~~~
His performance today was one of the worst midfield performances I have ever seen from a United player, I'd have Fellaini starting over him any day of the week at least with him you get some grit and physical presence.

1899~~~
Still think he's very complete in the sense that he's an all rounder with no real deficiencies in any one area. He just isn't all that good.

1900~~~
Has made less of a contribution than Fellaini this season.  

At the end of the day he is at best an average quality footballer and currently not even reaching those levels.

1901~~~
Shut up & sit down & don't even think about starting a discussion about him in a 2 man midfield ever again.

1902~~~
He plays in a 3 man midfield. Although even if Morgan had played as well it would still have been awful as he is bad atm as well. Weren't there 3 of them at Bilbao who hunted as a pack?

1903~~~
Played bad, but it's probably Fellaini's fault. fecking Rooney. LVG Out.

1904~~~
Worst midfield performance of the season and that's saying something. He's pissing me off.

1905~~~
Can't believe what I'm seeing with this lad - truly awful this season.

He has a really annoying habit of playing backwards when under zero pressure, almost to the point where it looks like he's just taking the piss out of the philosophy.

Annoyingly, I can see him going elsewhere and smashing it, but at the moment Fellaini deserves his spot in the team more.

1906~~~
I honestly believe LVG has drained his confidence and self belief from him.

He was poor but hes not one that can control a midfield and I think hes suited better to a MF3.

1907~~~
He is better in a midfield 3, but Morgan was awful the other day. Our options for all positions are short.

1908~~~
I actually think Herrera/Morgan wouldnt be too bad a partnership to try out (better than Carrick + 1 of them).

1909~~~
I don't think anything will work atm as their confidence is shot to pieces. They need a lift as much as the fans and it isn't going to come from this manager.

1910~~~
Oh yeah, I defo agree, I think ive mentioned it in a few threads, we wont see the best of some of these players with the current manager as they look scared / shot of confidence / confused.

Such a shame <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1911~~~
One of the top 10 CMs in the world apparently, according to a thread here not long ago...

I don't even care whether they're trying to play the manager out of the job, that performance is just disrespectful to the fans.

1912~~~
Of course it is, but we don't know if they are or they just have no confidence. Players are quick to realise if someone doesn't know what they are doing, so maybe unconsciously they have stopped listening to him. A bit like us.
p.s. subconsciously is what I meant, unconconsciously is how they are playing.

1913~~~
Just terrible tonight, surprised he stayed on for as long as he did.

1914~~~
He aint as bad as that but my word he was poor tonight.

1915~~~
When was his last last start (never mind start) again? There is no way he could possibly find any consistency when he is being used so erratically, more so than most of our players.

1916~~~
He had a string of 6(?) starts in a row around the end of December, start of January and was absolute dogshite.

1917~~~
Obviously he's much, much better than that, and I'm still a big fan. Admittedly, I can't see him being anything more than a squad player unless we play a 4-3-3. He's just OK as a #10 and he's not even that as one of a double pivot. We've pretty much all known this for quite a while, just one of many LVG-related frustrations.

1918~~~
Ah well, that goes to show how short my memory is.

1919~~~
He was awful, all three midfielders were least night. I can see him being sold in the summer, it's crazy we spent £100m on him, mata and fellaini and none of them are good enough.

1920~~~
I hope we sack the manager and give the new guy time to judge these players. I believe Herrera's best will come in a 2 Man midfield with a holding player alongside him am Herrera in a b2b all action role.

1921~~~
I really feel for him, I just get the feeling that Van Gaal doesn't like him. He tried to completely change how Herrera played and now I don't think he knows whether he is an 8 or a 10. He's just an in between twilight zone player who appears to be on the outer.

1922~~~
Yesterday he was playing like bad version of himself though. Running around like a headless chicken and no positional discipline. The way he got outmuscled and his passing has little to do with van Gaal.

1923~~~
comfortably his worst performance for us.

what's worse is he seems to be following the trend of being "zombified" (can't think of a suitable word) like what's happening to schneiderlin, darmian, depay. it's as if their footballing abilities have eroded over time and is continuing to happen

1924~~~
Yeah, everybody has bad games and has bad form. I am just talking in a general sense, I don't think even Herrera himself knows what he's really doing in this team. If we were to see him under a new manager next year I'd like to think he can re-grow his game before we jettison him however.

I still get the feeling LVG doesn't like/rate/trust him though.

1925~~~
Ha. That can't be. LvG said he can make every player better. Are you calling Mr. van Gaal a liar?

1926~~~
Liar, Liar pants on fire. I wish his were, at least it would be entertaining.

1927~~~
Really hard to understand that no midfielder stands out at all. Everyone's just poor

1928~~~
The whole team is playing badly, even Smallings form has dropped. That is down to the manager and his staff. Everyone can have a drop in form, but this isn't just a drop in form.

1929~~~
It's unsurprising that they're all a bit shit. It tends to happen when you have a manager who knows he has failed, and the atmosphere around the team is a defeatist and negative one. What I don't understand is the continuous emphasis on the midfielders playing in such a robotic, braindead and monotonous manner. If it's working and we're dominating teams, I get it. You want to be able to reproduce the same pattern of midfield control consistently. But our team is a mess. I would have thought letting individuality shine through would have a bit of sense. Instead Herrera, Mata, Schneiderlin and Carrick, keep playing as if they're going through the motions and just do the basics only (and often, wrongly).

Look at Herrera when he was playing consistently last season. He genuinely looked one of the best midfielders in the PL. He was given more freedom to do his thing, and it resulted in some very complete midfield play, including his use of the natural technical skill he possesses, which often got people here giddy. That's all gone now, and he's left looking like such a mediocre and basic midfielder.

1930~~~
Watching him last night I thought it was pretty obvious he's downed tools. And he's not the only one.

No matter how shit the manager is I can't be doing with players not giving it their all and I am now of the opinion that he can feck off when the inevitable post LVG clearout begins.

1931~~~
As it was with Moyes the players are now getting away with murder because they know Van Gaal has taken the fall for everything to do with this season. Some players are displaying a total lack of integrity and pride as professionals, totally unacceptable.

1932~~~
LVG can be blamed for a lot but not able to pass properly or keep the ball is a fecking joke. Form and confidence are crucial but just look at his mistakes and displays, it's shocking and he's as much to blame as LVG

1933~~~
A contender for worst individual performance of the season.

He's not playing for LVG anymore, hasn't been for a while to be fair.

1934~~~
He wouldn't get a look in for any serious manager, anyway.
So he'd be a fool to be putting little effort in. Might as well pack his bags and start house hunting in Spain again, if that's the case.

1935~~~
couldn't pereira play his role today? i have no idea how he starts after his showing on friday.

1936~~~
I dont see him here long term, and this isnt based off just his poor form this season. Even when he's played ok, or well, its normally in a position where there are plenty of better players available who can perform to a higher level than him. I dont see him as having elite level potential.

That said, as many have mentioned, his terrible performances aren't just down to him, the entire team is in disarray

1937~~~
Better today, I know the midfield was virtually empty in the first half but his passing and touch was less nervy than against Midgetland.

1938~~~
These games are the type where you can get your passing back and he looked far more confident, more than in some of the games last season in the F.A. Cup. Lovely assist for the Lingard goal as well.

1939~~~
Fantastic assist, his passing as a whole was great.

1940~~~
They got plenty of practice. I think Shrewsbury forgot what the ball looked like.

1941~~~
His best game in ages, against a shit team of course but hopefully it's a confidence boost to him and the others who needed one.

1942~~~
Not as involved as Schneiderlin but still a solid performance, the two of them kept us moving a lot quicker than we usually do.

1943~~~
The more they scored the more confidence they got. For such a tense game, they actually looked relaxed. Also do not let anyone else take the penalties. The play was definitely moving a lot quicker.
He was involved, just in a different area. Morgan seemed to be in the box more. Him and Ander must have had nose bleeds. Don't think they have been allowed that far up the pitch this season.

1944~~~
Great pen.

Does that mean he's on them now?

1945~~~
Yes

1946~~~
I remember him scoring another penalty for us a while back, and it was a great pen too. We should try using him more.

1947~~~
He absolutely hammers them doesn't he. Even if a goalie went the right way, I think the pace would beat them.

1948~~~
Cracking penalty.

1949~~~
Not his best game IMO - really should have buried that header in the 2nd half - but was still influential. Why can't all our penalties just be smashed? He is at least reliable for that, has taken some great penalties for us

1950~~~
It's only the second one he has ever taken. He has missed a calling there. It was the manager who told him he would be able to take penalties.

1951~~~
Based on the suspected rules, it would seem so, but then he's not always playing. Wonder who is next in line if Herrera isn't playing? 

Anyway, very good game by him today. Loved the midfield of Schneiderlin, Herrera, & Mata. They were buzzing and all over the place. Seems there was much more movement & quick attacking. Granted, Midtydland conceded possession & allowed us to stuff them inside their own half, but the execution was immense. It also helped that the FB's were such an integral part of the attack, allowing the play to get wider & wider.

1952~~~
I think the way we played tonight made him more influential. They were moving the ball a lot quicker and they were buzzing round the box. He looked a lot happier and relaxed. Nice to see.

1953~~~
I like what Riley and Varela bring, it was the same when Shaw plays.

1954~~~
Yes, that's true. He has been his best for us when he has other players making runs and can provide an outlet for them. Linked up constantly with Lingard and Varela, something like he used to do with Mata and Valencia last season at his best.

1955~~~
Better from him.

1956~~~
tidy and good performance considering he played quite deep next to schneiderlin who make him look better though, he was the most influential midfielder today, always where we needed him. But Herrera did his part and scored crucial penalty for us so I am happy for him, The movement around him is as others mentioned quite crucial but for who it is not? I hope they make good partnership now with Schneiderlin, we looked solid defensively despite throwing a lot of youngsters and two midfielders as CB's while scoring 5 goals it's almost a 5star performances in my view from the team

1957~~~
That pen was Ruud esque.

1958~~~
Nearly took the goal off with that penalty

1959~~~
He had a lot to make up for after that shocking header!!!!

1960~~~
Yeah that was a bad miss, almost an open goal to aim at and he missed completely.

1961~~~
Two better performances this week. I know it's poor opposition but he was utter shite against the same opposition a week ago so there's a big improvement there! 

Should have scored a header, cracker of a pen though and that goal will do him good I hope.

1962~~~
Good game, but should have scored the header. Possibly our most confident penalty taker, no nonsense type penalty again after thumping it to the roof vs Pool

1963~~~
Good penalty.  Mata, you're fired!

1964~~~
He will miss one eventually, but i would be happy if he would be our main penalty taker for quite some time. He will just smash 8 or 9 of ten penalties in.

1965~~~
He's had a very good game today. A lot like his old self.

1966~~~
Finally, Ander is back.

1967~~~
Excellent. Very good finish for his goal too.

1968~~~
Top game today. A bit brainless with some of the tackles but top performance. More of this please

1969~~~
Great game.  He was a constant thorn and good strike for the goal although very fortunate.

1970~~~
He played very well today imo.

1971~~~
Bossed the midfield along with Morgan.

1972~~~
Happy for the lad, he has taken a lot of stick, but has come back to form. Maybe those two previous games really did lift the teams confidence. Glad he got a goal. Chelsea won titles on deflected goals, so nice to get a bit of luck for a change.

1973~~~
Ander for president, gave 600% today

1974~~~
A very good performance today. Has had unfair stick. Well done lad!

1975~~~
Brilliant game.

1976~~~
Classy play for the first goal. Makes a tackle, plays a 1-2 and releases Varela down the channel. Glad he's back in form I really enjoy watching him

1977~~~
Best performance of the season by a country mile

1978~~~
Weird that given some consistent game time he starts performing well again. Him and Schniederlin are the future, they need to play together as much as possible.

1979~~~
Yes he's sometimes sloppy in possession but if you give this lad time to find form he is a top quality midfielder.

1980~~~
MoTM for me - Outstanding.

1981~~~
Excellent today, after Rashford he was my MOTM, used the ball well and got about Arsenal's midfield, won that battle.

1982~~~
He was great. Especially since Schneiderlin decided to not turn up.

1983~~~
Agreed.  That's the mid many want to see.  He was a monster today and Morgan was very good too.

1984~~~
No idea how he stayed on the pitch all game. I'm a big fan but his tackling's ridiculous sometimes.

1985~~~
I actually disagree with that.  Morgan was very tidy and broke up a lot of Arsenal plays.  Dovetailed well with Ander.  I don't expect Morgan to be the box to box that many think he could be.  He should stick to destroying.  Ander and Mata can do the attacking.

1986~~~
He's a better player when he plays in his actual position. He shouldn't be playing further forward.

1987~~~
Even on his off days he's guaranteed to be a ball of pure passion and desire.

1988~~~
He and Mata work so well together, it's fun to watch them combine for those short, quick passes

1989~~~
Ander was outstanding today.  Had a huge role in two of our goals.

1990~~~
this

1991~~~
Man of the match for me. Great all round performance.

1992~~~
Best he's played in a while.

1993~~~
Ander is back <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1994~~~
Keano, Incey and Robbo were hardly saints you'll agree. It's Arsenal, you need to put the foot in.

Good to see Ander playing with confidence again. Hopefully this marks the end of the Herrera at #10 stuff. He's an #8. Maybe a bit undisciplined, but then so was Gerrard and he did okay in the Premier League...

...apart from when he slipped <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1995~~~
Thought he played very well today. Lots of energy and him and Mata combined very well. Great play in the build up to the first goal as well.

1996~~~
Much more like the Herrera we know and love. Played a huge role in the 1st goal and scored the 3rd.

Hope he carries on like this, an in form Herrera makes such a difference.

1997~~~
He plays very well with Morgan. Hopefully LVG doesn't change anything.

1998~~~
Only thing I don't like about him is that he makes some dumbass clearances at times for someone of his quality.

1999~~~
That's BS. Morgan was a great defensive partner for Ander today.

2000~~~
Been critical of this guy in the past, but that was a quality performance. Always thought he would be a better midfielder than no 10. Hopefully he keeps it up! Man of the Match for me.

It's a really good combination with Schneiderlin and should be the way forward.

2001~~~
Love his passion, he's like Rafael in that sense! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2002~~~
I agree. Both had two or three sloppy moments between them, especially when we were under the cosh and just getting the ball out, but it was a good pairing. One I was worried about before the game but they did well. Hope to see more of it and hope it can work in a similar fashion to Matic/Cesc did last season.

2003~~~
Very good. Ander is at hjs best in these intense performances where we stretch teams. Important goal and it seemed to be a quality effort even without the deflection.

2004~~~
Getting better after some poor recent performances.

2005~~~
He really is a big game player,  defo he name I want to see in the team sheet against the top 4.

2006~~~
Schneiderlin broke up play all game. Dunno wot game you were watchin

2007~~~
Just watched the heights again, he goes mental in his celebration, love this lad! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2008~~~
Thought he absolutely bossed it today. He was all over the place, got the goal, was plucky in defence, bright going forward and although Schneiderlin let us down on the goals, I thought they brought the best out of each other and were very balanced in our general play.

2009~~~
Him and Schneiderlin are a perfect partnership. Two energetic box-to-box players, one more attacking and the other more defensive. It's a very well balanced pair.

2010~~~
I've always wondered why our midfield never clicked - a partnership of Ander and Morgan must surely work great at least in a 3-man midfield? I can't seem to remember a lot of what has happened this season but I can only imagine they didn't play a lot together.

2011~~~
Was excellent today.

2012~~~
Him and Morgan need to play together more and need time to develop as a partnership. You see there are makings of something good, mobile, fresh and aggressive. Morgan seems to drop and cover whilst Herrera has good understanding with Mata.

Deserved his goal too.

2013~~~
Rashford gets the plaudits, and fair enough, but Herrera (and to some extent Schneiderlin) made today happen. He has the knack of finding that pass which suddenly doubles the tempo, as when he slid the ball round a corner to Mata after winning it back in the build-up to the first goal.

Crucial that he keeps starting in midfield, even when Schweinsteiger is back. Otherwise we go straight back to the toothless possession of the autumn.

2014~~~
Nah the stick was fair. But last night he was amazing.

2015~~~
Apart from everything being said, he likes communicating on the pitch and encouraging the younger players all the time, which is quite wonderful to see.

2016~~~
He's brilliant - love it when he has games like this. He plays with so much energy and passion - on top of all that he is very talented. Need more consistency from him - which will definitely come if he continues to play with Morgan (who was fanastic). 

He genuinely looks like a good guy who loves the club and would work his was off for it - which is rare considering he is from another country and a relatively big money signing.

2017~~~
Ander was outstanding today.  What he can't do is carry a struggling side on his back, but when his teammates are he's sensational.

2018~~~
Probably my favourite player in the squad, the passion he has for the club would make you think he's an academy prospect. I always remember that time we scored and he nearly broke the bench from excitement. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2019~~~
His contribution to the first goal was classic CM play. Brilliant stuff

2020~~~
There was never a good reason to have him on the bench. 

Look at the Rashford goal after the Walcott giveaway. Herrera is the only player in the team likely to win the ball and play a 1-2 then hit a fullback with a clever pass. We have other players with skill and other players with mobility and hunger, but not a lot with both. Maybe just Shaw and Martial, really.

2021~~~
We play a more attacking game and this guy looks good again, surprise? He is not a pass between your defense/GK and defend kind of midfielder. He is suited to a higher tempo game, with high pressing and quick interchanges. Can be a defensive liability and his tacking is shocking at time. Should play in a three.

2022~~~
He played well, like the rest of the team, not sure why everyone is falling over themselves to single him out for praise, lol. I don't like his habit of clearing the ball aimlessly when we are under pressure, for someone of his quality, he should be able to hold the ball a bit longer.

2023~~~
Like Welbeck and Nani and Kagawa and Chicharito and all the people we let go.

2024~~~
Controlled things in the middle today with Schneiderlin, there's so much energy in that midfield pairing, they just afford the opposition no time on the ball.

2025~~~
He did very well but you also need mention Mata who did a good job helping out the midfield and opening up space. I'd like to see more of Herrera in midfield

2026~~~
We should have kept Nani whom everyone wanted sold, Kagawa, who did nothing in a United shirt & Welbeck who usually flattered to deceive?

2027~~~
So good at finding space. We're finally playing the ball into him as well.

2028~~~
Other than Chicharito, we were right to sell them all.

Our problem was the lack of replacements.

2029~~~
Agreed. The level of rewriting of people on here's views of Nani rivals Soviet propaganda.

2030~~~
Leave the Russians' alone , but yeah...I for one think we should have got rid of Nani around 2013. His time here was up. Anyone who saw his perfomances in the US tour of 2014 could see that he looked like someone who wanted out. No effort whatsoever, and that most likely did leave an impression on the new manager.

2031~~~
Exactly, Chicharito is the only one i would have kept if it was left to me. Rest were deservedly shipped off.

2032~~~
Chicharito was especially worse because of the timing of it too. We started Fellaini as striker in our next game, against Liverpool.

2033~~~
Liking his partnership with Schneiderlin, they work together very well. Hope LvG sticks with it, they bossed the midfield yesterday and get Arsenal quiet. Great pressing too.

2034~~~
Needs to remember how to string a pass.

2035~~~
the passing has been really off might not be feeling his legs after so many games in a row

2036~~~
I keep feeling like he isnt quite going to make it here.

2037~~~
They worked their socks off against Arsenal, that and the conditions tonight might have left a few feeling leggy. Not too worried.

2038~~~
Probably this, glad he got subbed.

2039~~~
I was a bit surprised that he didn't take Memphis off. We won anyway. There are a lot of games coming up, so I hope we get more players back to rotate, but they are big games so we need the senior players out there.

2040~~~
Thought he was average tonight, I still don't think he's that suited to a 2 man CM set-up.

2041~~~
Think he can do it in a counter-attacking setup, where his through balls can pick out runners and he has energy to press. When teams sit deep, he looks very limited. His short and long passing game is very average for a patient build-up.

2042~~~
He'd operate much better in a MF3, Van Gaal has practically spayed all of the mobile defensive ability that he had. His pressing is completely different now than at Bilbao. Much less to do with chasing the ball and more about reading the play and I don't think that is his strength. He'd be much better off with the time and space to close down the ball without the responsibility of holding his zone. Iturraspe, De Marcos, Gurpegui and Martinez were much better foils for him in the three at Bilbao.

This squad at the moment really doesn't have a suitable three combination at all. Especially with Schweinsteiger/Carrick doing a timeshare when they aren't injured. It is a bit of a mess which is why Van Gaal has completely changed Herrera's game. Which imo is for the worse and away from what would be a strength domestically in England but that is my opinion.

2043~~~
This is spot on.  I watched him play at AB a few times on TV when rumours started about us getting him.  Their press was much more about chasing the ball rather than this zonal press we have.  He obviously had much more freedom to roam and press forward at AB and it suited his strengths of dribbling and going forward and joining the attack.  That said, I think he deserves a starting spot with a true holding MF like Morgan as his partner.  He was okay in tonight's game but he clicks rather well with Morgan.  Obviously has a connection with Mata.

2044~~~
I think whichever system we use he's best as the most advanced in a proper 3 man midfield, not as a #10 or in the double pivot.

2045~~~
He's great in big games but isn't suited to be regularly the first name on the team sheet.

2046~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVyFukMxyng?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2047~~~
Certainly not the first name -- that always goes to De Gea -- how about being a regular starter, allowing for the occasional rest or tactical benching?

2048~~~
He wasn't at his best against Watford, but can't really blame him as he and the other players were obviously tired after playing 3 games in 6 days last week, so Watford's pressure, energy, aggression and physicality were too much to handle. That's why winning the game was was important, especially when you consider the losses of our rivals. 

He also makes some very good points in his interview, it's not the usual generic rubbish that the other players tend to say after poor performances. Watford played without any pressure whatsoever and they were pretty close to going home with the 3 points had Ighalo scored some of his chances.

2049~~~
God I love him and Mata. I think they should start every game; Herrera isn't without his faults, but he brings a dynamism that is sadly lacking when he's off the pitch.

2050~~~
Don't give in to his anti-Herrera lunacy. 

Herrera is the only midfielder we have who can pass AND move at higher than average levels. Bastien and Mata can pass but not move. Schneiderlin can move but not pass. 

Midfield is Herrera, a deeper midfielder (normally Schneiderlin but with enough possession there's a case for Schweinsteiger or Carrick or even Blind) and a 3rd player, either Mata or a midfielder we desperately need to sign this summer.

2051~~~
From this squad, a midfield three of Herrera Schneiderlin and Blind would be outstanding.  That puts a lot of pressure on Morgan but I really do think he'll be up to it next season.

But this thread is about Herrera and once the man is in his rhythm he's incredibly effective.  He's no defensive destroyer but he's competent defensively.  He's a passer, not a dribbler, but he's not afraid to move with and without the ball.  And he's good for the occasional goal.

2052~~~
He offers us something different than our other CMs. In big games, he's a must. He's a little inconsistent in others though. 

Agree with the rest of your post. But is that 1st line directed at me? You couldn't be any wronger with that.

2053~~~
If I look in my heart, I have to say it's directed at Van Gaal. 

If we sneak top 4 and lose in a not-embarrassing way (say a tight loss to Dortmund, Spurs or Sevilla) in the Europa League semi-finals or finals and win the FA Cup and an argument on if we should keep Van Gaal breaks out, Herrera being benched at times will be a factor (not first, but there) for me. 

It genuinely confuses and annoys me the the only player other than Shaw on the team who is mobile and technically strong (I guess De Gea sort of counts too) isn't undroppable.

2054~~~
What an awful half. He has been misplacing passes all over the place and giving the ball straight back to the opposition during aerial duels every single time.

2055~~~
Completely disagree, at least since the red card.  Didn't like him this year at all, but today after Mata's red he's been great, IMO.

2056~~~
Seriously? He played some beautiful passes out to the right flank. Such a shame we are down to ten men as he looks on his game today.

2057~~~
Are you even watching?

Him and Smalling have been really good.

2058~~~
Huh? He's been great in duels, considering that's what the WBA midfield specialise in. And he's got us out of pressure many times. Those passes to Lingard from the middle of a crowd were great.

2059~~~
I've been a big fan of him, but feck me he seems lost most of the time. He throws the ball away so stupidly and careless - and not just when trying to be adventerous. That I could forgive, but most of the time there is seemingly no idea behind his hoofing or direction of the ball.

2060~~~
I thought that after the red he should be shifted to a "narrow" wide position, with Schneiderlin replacing Lingard, but Lingard has been much better sine moving to the left. In fact, Rashford, Martial, and Lingard all look more comfortable in their new positions.

2061~~~
He gives the ball away too much and takes too much time on the ball. Not good from the guy who is supposed to link up between midfield and attack.

2062~~~
Yes he has had some nice passes here and there but he has been carelessly giving the ball away a lot this half. I don't know why he heads the ball straight back to the opposition when he clearly has the space or time to control the ball or pick out a team mate. He is capable of much better.

2063~~~
Would take 15-20m for him in the summer and never look back, not good enough. Just like Shinji, too much hype

2064~~~
I actually thought he was one of our best players before he got subbed. But Van Gaal doesn't like high energy centre midfielders apparently.

2065~~~
He was utter shit.

2066~~~
He was okay. Didn't do too much, but offered more than Carrick certainly. He should've ideally been more of a creative force though with his energy, someone driving us forward despite them having the extra man.

2067~~~
I am genuinely puzzled at this. Was he? He was winning duels, and actually playing and pressing high enough to play with the front three and not invite West Brom into our half. 

We lost the momentum after his sub.

2068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The lack of appreciation for intelligent players is truly astonishing.

2069~~~
Under LvG, i dont see the intelligence. You mean keeping possession and doing feck all is intellligence now? He plays so badly against the average teams, he just cares against the big boys.

2070~~~
After that red card, what did you expect him to do? Honest question.

2071~~~
I thought he was our best outfield player after Smalling today, the only midfielder we have that can both move and pass.

2072~~~
No he wasn't. No one was apart from Mata.

2073~~~
Except that I'm not referring to that. Who aside from Ander picks the right passes on a regular basis and provides mobility and the extra passing option with his movement? 

The system is to blame. Not the player.

2074~~~
Haha, 'intelligent player'. He really isn't great. Can't defend, isn't a great passer of the ball, can't tackle, not really great with the ball. Should never play in a two men midfield by the way. He's got energy and is tidy sometimes, but that's about it. Decent squad player but shouldn't start every game for Manchester United.

I should clarify that I didn't want LvG to sub him off. Stupid change.

2075~~~
You would think based on the fact we were out numbered keeping him on would have been wise as you would expect him to be able to get around the pitch more than Carrick. Also offers far more going forward.

Thought he did ok today suffered when Mata went off.

2076~~~
He's not an intelligent player ffs

Intelligent players make use of their technique, understand the space around and how to use it. He's our Henderson. Passionate, tenacious but far from intelligent.

Jack Wilshere has wonderful technique but is the opposite of intelligence. Technique isn't the be-all!!

2077~~~
Bizarre reaction in here. We were horrendous after he came off. Thought he was our best player before being subbed.

2078~~~
Really didn't notice him much so he must not have played well but certainly replacing him didn't do anything either.

2079~~~
Now now lets not be harsh here. Herrera is a far better player than that clown even if he does get overrated now and then.

2080~~~
Needs to show more composure at times. Some of his passing was really rushed and sloppy and it was pretty basic stuff.

2081~~~
Him coming into cm was a big difference in winning the last 4 games before today, is that forgotten already?

2082~~~
Ozil can't defend but is an intelligent player. The same goes for players like Silva, Okazaki, Coutinho, all of whom are attackers but intelligent nonetheless. You people have no idea or have warped views on intelligence.

2083~~~
Agreed. Carrick was much worse, yet Herrera is the one getting subbed

2084~~~
I think he was the least of our worries today. A shambles of a defence and a captain who is not a captain and can no longer run at even a snails pace were more of a problem. Oh and Mata getting sent off.

2085~~~
The term intelligent player gets thrown around far too many times on here, Blind for example.

2086~~~
But Ozil doesen't play in a midfield two, and Ozil have what, 6-7 goals and like 20 assist? Silva and Ozil are top, top players in this league. Herrera just isn't. Can't compare them at all.

2087~~~
Did nothing, just runs around a lot.

2088~~~
I'm not saying he was a problem or our main problem. I'm just rating his performance which i thought this thread was for

2089~~~
He was not fabulous, but a damn sight better than most and he didn't lose us the game.

2090~~~
I wish he took on more responsibility, creativity wise. He has a good eye for a pass but defers everything right now.

2091~~~
He's probably my favourite player in the squad but its becoming clear that he lacks the ability to dictate a game. I thought he would be able to develop that side of his game but he doesn't have the calmness in passing or the ability to pick the right pass consistently. Its why I'd place him in the Ramsey, Fernandinho, Dembele level of midfielder rather than the Toure, Cazorla, Cesc class in the PL.

2092~~~
I think he did quite well not sure about the pessimism here, sprayed the ball well in the opening minutes and after we went to ten men it was always gonna be difficult for us. Dont understand the substitution, he was perhaps too tidy at times but still with a different mindset he would help us more than Schneiderlin who should probably start or be sent of for Carrick who didnt have the best of games despite being fresh let alone weneeded more legs and Carrick's passing which was off never made up for his lack of mobility which was really needed

2093~~~
I don't know about others, but I've never really seen him as the type who'll dictate a game, as in the Xavi-type midfielder who sits back and pulls the string. If he does improve and becomes a key player for us, I feel that he'd be more of a creator: someone who bursts forward, tries to find incisive passes to a striker, and has a good goals/assists contribution. He does manage to do that sometimes, but can often frustrate too.

2094~~~
Herrera is not the dictator type, he is the type of player that keeps the game ticking and the tempo up. It's no coincidence that when Herrera is on song, we play some of more exciting game in terms of tempo. His game will sometimes clash with a slow possession type football as an increased tempo is not risk averse and the expansive game means mistakes which LVG hates. We need a player.

2095~~~
He was rubbish today. He was one of the main reasons why we couldn't get any control in the game because he didn't even attempt to control the ball half the time, instead just opting for one time hits up the field.

2096~~~
I agree with you that he'll never be a Xavi type but even No 10's like Ozil and Silva bring a calmness and decision making in passing that's crucial to their sides keeping control. I still have hope that he can go to the next level I just doubt it will be under LvG as Herrera's natural game is the antithesis to van Gaal's philosophy.

2097~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Manchester United in danger of losing Ander Herrera as Atletico Madrid and Juventus lead chase for Spanish midfielder </b></span>
<ul>
<li><b>Ander Herrera enters the final two years of his contract this summer</b></li>
<li><b>He has an option to extend his Manchester United deal by a further year</b></li>
<li><b>Juventus and Atletico Madrid have identified Herrera as a target</b></li>
<li><b>Spanish midfielder has grown frustrated under Louis van Gaal at United</b></li>
</ul><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> are facing a fight to keep midfielder Ander Herrera this summer.

The Spanish star is the subject of growing interest from his homeland - namely Atletico Madrid - ahead of the summer transfer window.

Likewise, Herrera has also been scouted by Juventus as the Italian giants weigh up midfield reinforcements for Paul Pogba, who is set to leave Turin this summer.

Herrera, it is understood, would prefer a switch to Spain if he is to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season.

The 26-year-old enters the final two years of his contract in the summer, but has an option to extend the deal by a further 12 months.

But his future will come under scrutiny this summer as rival clubs monitor the classy midfielder.

Despite his current contract not expiring until 2018, United may find it difficult to resist any offers close to the £29million they paid Athletic Bilbao for the Spain international in 2014.

Likewise, Herrera may find it impossible not to push for a return to his homeland this summer should La Liga come knocking.

The former Real Zaragoza star has played in various positions in Louis van Gaal's midfield since his arrival at the start of last season.

Van Gaal's ploy to utilise Herrera, whose preferred position is at No 10, in different roles is believed to be a source of frustration for the Spaniard.

Indeed, Herrera's future could rest on whether Van Gaal remains in charge beyond the summer.

United are aware of the growing interest in Herrera from abroad but won't make a decision on his future until the summer.



It begins.....

2098~~~
Would fit Atletico like a glove with his pressing, even though they play a midfield two. If they chnaged it to a midfield 3, where he would play as another 8 or 10, he would be perfect for them.

2099~~~
I'll be so angry if we let him go. What an exercise in mismanagement he's been subjected to these last two seasons.

2100~~~
If LVG stays for another season then in my opinion he'll go. I think it has been made pretty obvious that LVG doesn't like/rate him and his adventurous nature doesn't fit with the rigid style that he's trying to enact at our club. I wouldn't be upset at Ander if he left, I wouldn't blame him to be honest.

2101~~~
disgusting if we let one of our best midfielder go but I dont believe in these shit rumours besides Vangle will be forced to retire after this shocking season

2102~~~
Can't believe this lad didn't play against Liverpool.

He's had some mediocre games this season (amongst some crackers) but in a game where passion, determination and will to win is needed, it doesn't get any bigger than Liverpool away, and as far as I'm concerned Ander is one of the handful who consistently seem to have what it takes in this respect.

It made me sad seeing him in the tunnel before the game watching the other players line up and wishing them luck, as I know he would have been desperate to have been starting.

I would be gutted if he left if only because he deserves a chance under a different type of manager. He could be a club legend.

Sadly I think the experience of the last two years will see him out of the door, even though he clearly gets and loves the club.

2103~~~
Would he feck. He has nowhere near the tactical discipline to play in a Simeone midfield.

2104~~~
Griezmann couldn't too but Simeone made him work a lot, that's why he wasn't a starter at the beginning. Someone like Vietto is eased in too.

2105~~~
Griezmann was an intelligent player who didn't (have to) work hard at Sociedad. Ander Herrera is a hard worker with a better engine than Griezmann had but he's thick as champ. It's harder to get someone to improve their positioning than to get them to work hard.

2106~~~
And Ferreira Carrasco wasn't an intelligent player and Simeone is working well with him. My point is that Simeone builds players for his team, he doesn't buy finished products or perfect fits.
And Griezmann totally changed, his positioning, decision making and movements have improved. It's not just about working hard.


Edit: Valverde and Bielsa demand a lot of discipline from their players and Herrera was great with both.

2107~~~
If Jose comes in think he will stay. If this clown is still here, then I wouldn't blame him for going. The quality players abroad will be watching what is happening with us and won't touch us with a ten foot bargepole unless we change managers. The only ones who will come will be kids who don't know better, ones who are ready to retire and want one last payday and below average players who will not raise us to the level we need to be. What player in their right mind would want to come to this madhouse?

2108~~~
Like Griezmann, Carrasco is an attacker. That's entirely different to being a midfielder in a Simeone team.

Even Koke took ages to gain Simeone's trust to play centrally and he's someone who's a lot better and more disciplined than Ander.

Anyway, the final sentence of your post doesn't contradict my point, which is that he doesn't fit Atlético like a glove.

2109~~~
My point is that Simeone isn't after players who fits him like a glove, he isn't an idiot he knows it doesn't exist and will have to make them fit.

2110~~~
I know now.

2111~~~
It will be ridiculously sad if we kept the buffoon long enough to lose players like Herrera, Adnan, Pereira, etc

2112~~~
I hope I didn't rubbed you in the wrong way?

2113~~~
Nah, just thought originally you disagreed with me saying he doesn't fit Atlético like a glove (rather than agreeing he doesn't but saying that Simeone can 'fix' him).

2114~~~
So we've gone from "would fit Atletico like a glove" to "he wouldn't suit at all but Simeone would make him fit"!! By that token, I am as suitable for Simeone's midfield as Ander!!

For what it's worth, I don't think Ander is United quality or the type of playing style I like..... Would prefer somebody more mobile in either the No8 or No10 roles. He suits tiki taka much more than United's style

2115~~~
The stuff that wins things at the moment. Ander plays a pressing game, the sort we needed against Liverpool, but LvG didn't grasp how they were going to play. I would love to see us do that more, but to me unless we play the kids, the others in the midfield don't have the energy for it. The old United didn't let anyone have time on the ball. That might be why SAF was looking at the lad.

2116~~~
Agree entirely, playing Fellaini instead of Herrera against Liverpool was criminal and weak.

2117~~~
Can just imagine the reaction of Xavi, Iniesta and other "tiki taka" players when Ander repeatedly misplaces the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2118~~~
He wouldn't get in the tiki taka of Barca or Bayern now. Maybe a smaller team.

2119~~~
I'm not sure. Our <i>current </i>style doesn't suit him, but I'm not sure it particularly suits anyone because of how dire it is. I don't think he's consistent enough in his passing/ball retention though to play a tiki-taka sort of style.

Since he's a hard worker and can be seen as a fairly attack-minded midfielder, he'd probably suit a more attacking, open, counter-attack style of play.

2120~~~
I edited my post. So read it all please.

2121~~~
Spot on. A Dortmund type team (at a lower level) is perfect for him.

2122~~~
Exactly our style is wrong for all our players. The way we played against Arsenal is more us, lots of energy. Funny he had the kids in that. Instead of some players who are two stone overweight or have the pace of a tortoise with one leg.

2123~~~
As much as he hasn't been a rip roaring success there are a lot of players needed moved on or replaced before we get to him. The least of our worries imo.

2124~~~
Agreed. I don't think he's going to be someone we necessarily build our midfield around, but he's a decent player who's had some alright spells for us. Someone I'd definitely keep, along with the likes of Depay, Schneiderlin and Mata, all of whom (like Herrera) have often disappointed, but are either good enough to offer us something, or hopefully will at some stage.

2125~~~
Jones, Carrick, BFS, Young, Fellaini, even Mata should be gone before him. He offers something. They are either injured, too old, scared shitless when the chips are down or useless.

2126~~~
If that chinless bellwhiff drives out players like Ander, I hope a pitch invasion launches towards the dugout, carries him out of Old Trafford and throws him in the canal.

2127~~~
There were good signs there last season and instead of building on that and getting players we actually needed, Morgan we needed, BFS we didn't. He tore everything to bits. We have been left short up front, but like last season where he was trying to fit every striker into the team, he has meddled with the midfield. When we find a combination that was starting to build up some momentum, he changes it and we are back to the bad old ways. You don't change what is working well.

2128~~~
I said he should have been launched into the Mersey on Thursday.

2129~~~
Good call, with all the toxic waste and such.

2130~~~
I would personally keep these guys and add 3 new front men (7 Moura, 9 Lukaku & 11 Mane) this adds serious pace to the side and the capability of guys taking on players on a 1 v1 and then a centre half with experience (Hummels) and an attacking right back (Coleman). Try and sell Rooney, Adnan and Fellaini and try keep everyone else as we are way short in numbers of senior players imo. If money outrageous for Lukaku get Zlatan for a season or two. Our midfield can survive without an addition I'd be happy enough with Herrera and Morgan and a back up of Bastian, Carrick, Lingard, Pereira and Blind, unless there is an better player available than Herrera or Morgan.

2131~~~
Some of the names being thrown about. We have been brainwashed with the biggest club in the world rhetoric from Ed. If we finish any lower than we are now we will be lucky to get any big name players. We will likely get other teams cast offs, so  they can make space for the really big signings. That is the problem we have, we could get even more average while other teams improve.

2132~~~
I honestly couldn't care if he fecked off. No doubt to rule the world leading Barcelona's midfield.

2133~~~
To be fair apart from maybe Moura (if PSG still want him) I think these guys are all attainable and none really in the big name mould. With Zlatan he is mid 30s and there is every chance he could be clubless!

2134~~~
I didn't mean your suggestions, I meant more the Gundogan class. Everton might have money coming in. Ones wanting us to clear them out, they might sell one player, not all their class players.

2135~~~
Yep the more I think of it I think we will struggle to buy in EPL as clubs will be cash rich so my suggestions may be a year to late. The league will get filled up with quite a few more foreigners next year then. I wonder how many will be top class or second rate and over hyped and over priced as usually Spain Portugal and Italian clubs cream the English clubs in transfers. But given the wages on offer most players will see the EPL as the land of milk and honey.

2136~~~
That's the worry, also us signing loads of CB whose name end in ic, hoping we have found the new Vidic.

2137~~~
He'd do well for Atletico but better for Juventus since they allow their central midfielders to bomb on a bit more.

2138~~~
Probably, but a suggestion, why don't we just let ours do that?

2139~~~
Maybe he can piggy-back our Dutch uber-composed CB who wins his headers there too on his way.

2140~~~
Much better in the second half, superb cross for the goal.

2141~~~
He was excellent tonight. He shows passion in his game which everyone wants to see. Yeah sometimes he tries stuff which loses possession but in this horrid boring zombie playing team but it's definitely needed. His cross was a peach. So difficult to execute in that situation and he did it perfectly. Lost count of how many times he won the ball back for us as well

2142~~~
Played very well today. 

Has a hell of a lot of shots blocked though. Not just this game but in general.

2143~~~
He was okay. Very active, but for most of the game lacked any form of end product. Very good cross though for the goal.

2144~~~
He was nowhere near excellent. Great ball for the goal but that aside he was pretty poor.

2145~~~
Needs to stop giving the ball away by panicking and booting it uselessly away. That sucks, control it and play a pass.

2146~~~
Herrera has looked best as a 10 this season, played as a 10 when we thumped Everton and played his best performance for while today as a 10.

2147~~~
He needs to have team mates he can trust. How can you not be panicky when your partners are Fellaini and Carrick?

2148~~~
Thought he was below par again, but it was a good cross for the goal.

2149~~~
He was one of our worst players in the first half... He greatly improved in the second though.

2150~~~
Rest assured that when Rooney comes back, Herrera will be benched because the captain shall always play.

2151~~~
Yeah, he probably needs to look into it. 

I thought he was good today. Boots balls out of for clearances in a panicky fashion a tad bit too often though. But I honestly would take that over him lamely giving the ball away in dangerous positions like Carrick did against Liverpool. He provides a bit of energy and hurriedness to the team though so I'd guess his mentality would always lead him to taking that choice of clearing the ball when he finds himself being in an uncomfortable position.

2152~~~
It's like his twin played the first half and the real Herrera came on in the 2nd.

2153~~~
Runs around a lot but nothing else to his game, can't believe we paid 28m for this.

2154~~~
I don't think he played that well as a 10 today. We changed our shape a bit at the sub and Schweinsteiger had more freedom than Herrera after it. That is when Herrera's best football was played. Before that he was simply chasing the centre backs around hopelessly. He's much better when he can join an attack from deep.

Thought he played well today. Great assist, and the cross that Martial headed into the back of Rashford deserved more as well. Better than he has been recently but still a shadow of the player he was last March when high on belief. Hopefully he won't get dropped and will be able to get some momentum going.

2155~~~
^I think he had a very good game. No end product is a fair criticism but that's a reflection on the whole team.

Why was he good? Look at the amount of times he turned nothing balls/moments into progressive phases. The panicking thing/booting was because he was simply knackered (the same goes for Blind) because he was trying to make things happen. He was playing next to Fellani and Carrick, who was never near his vicinity most of the times; as such he was sprinting up and down the pitch, into tackles, making space for passes. Those who say he lacks end product do you expect him to drop a shoulder and dribble past several players then lay off a pass/assist? Or to expect him to play through balls? Or link up with Martial/Rashford better?

Yes you could and maybe you should expect that but how is he going to do that when we don't play through the midfield and he doesn't get the ball from Fellani and Carrick unless he physically stands next to them. Fellani was doing his effective but not really effective thing of running all over the pitch and I'm pretty sure Carrick's touch map would be closer to Blind than anywhere near the centre of the pitch.

He could very well have stuck to an advanced midfield position/no.10 but I'd guarantee you he would have been involved much less in the game. As a result, you would then see Fellani and Carrick trying to control the midfield on their own and then we probably would have conceded more possession and had nowhere near the same amount of fight and ball movement that Herrera would have brought with his 'running'. It's not running without end product, he's putting himself into difficult situations because he's giving the team an option.

It's ridiculous people don't understand this.

2156~~~
He plays with a passion missing from a lot of our players but I thought he was sloppy and a bit of a headless chicken in the first half, the #10 isn't where's best, once he moved a little deeper and wider when Schweini came on we saw some quality from him.

2157~~~
If he isn't starting on Thursday I'm not gonna watch it.

2158~~~
Thought he was one of our best players today. We need to get that Schneiderlin-schweinsteiger-herrera trio back starting games IMO, but his form has definitely improved in recent weeks. Thought he was unlucky with the amount of blocks they had on his shots.

Also is a lot better as part of a 4-3-3 and not a pure 10. Him and Schweinsteiger as slightly more advanced like the second half, with someone dictating behind them is a good trio.

2159~~~
One of our best players today. At the heart of everything.

2160~~~
considering the circumstances (having Carrick and Fellaini as partners) he did quite well particularly in the second half, was meh in the first one.. anyways I wouldn't judge him under Vangle, he's clearly holding him back

2161~~~
His passing was far too erratic, again. I mean, I know it's lazy to criticize his passing as his passing game is overall more adventurous than our other midfielders, but I still think he both opts for the wrong option and messes up relatively simple passes too often. I feel this is very obvious if you look at how rarely he actually instigates danger with his passes. We quite frankly need more from someone in his position.

Hopefully he has it in him though. As I said recently, it's difficult to judge several players in this regime, and for some reason I still feel like he's the one that suffers the most in our set up.

Thought he had OK game overall tonight though.

2162~~~
Such a good two way player. Should have done better with his finishing today, but played well linking up the play between the midfield and attack. And of course the assist.

2163~~~
I thought this was one of his best performances in a while tbh.

2164~~~
Just stop picking Fellaini LvG. Ander was paired with someone whose legs have well gone and an inanimate object. Best in a midfield 3. BFS/Morgan/Ander it is.

2165~~~
Much better in the second half than in the first, nice cross for the goal too.

2166~~~
He tries things and isnt safe. I think hes one of the best players we have when opposition put pressure on him. Like with Arsenal, he keeps things going with some quick passes to move the play. I honestly think Mata is the only one that understands his movements and quick passing.

2167~~~
Thought he was OK yesterday, but still nowhere near the performances of last season IMO. I really like guy but I struggle to see what his future role at the club is going to be unless Giggs chooses to play with a CM of 3 men next season.

2168~~~
Lost count of the amount of times he's had chances just outside the box and skied them. Does my head in with it.

2169~~~
Which is why he has never been or has been expected to be a prolific scorer. That was not his role. Goals have been added to his game. A lot of his goals last season were inside the box and were shots along the floor. We don't have anyone who is great at shooting tbh. The only one vaguely good at freekicks is Mata. The only way I would fancy us in a penalty shootout is if Ander took them all. Didn't we buy Memphis because he was supposedly good at freekicks and shooting.

2170~~~
He's not being asked to be prolific though, he's simply being asked to keep it on target, which he's failing to do so recently. They've not been difficult chances, Saturday league players do that, he should be a cut above.

I love his energy, his final ball is a bit lacking though. I'm sure that will come though. I've been a fan of him since his Zaragoza days, hope he's here for a long time.

2171~~~
At least he keeps trying. I would rather that than nothing. Anyway he might miss-hit one and it will go in. If you keep shooting and a deflection puts it in. Frank Lampard made a living out of that. At least we seems to have a penalty taker now.

2172~~~
I'm not asking him to be prolific - just get a few on target now and then - at least work the keeper. I like Herrera, his attitude and enthusiasm is outstanding as well as his work rate and he has quality - could do with scoring more goals though.

2173~~~
Yeah, can't deny that. I can only wish he gets a tenth of Lampards luck in that sense! Yeah, it will be nice to have him next season as a more senior figure, with responsibilities like being the pen taker. Hopefully he can step up his game.

2174~~~
Irritated so many times yesterday but that slide tackle alone is enough to make you forget about. If only some of our other players would show as much passion.

Wish he could be a bit more consistent though. And some of his passes were awful.

2175~~~
How do you get that it you are pulled in and out of the side? He was building an understanding with Morgan and lo and behold they have been split up, which is not helping either of them build a partnership or consistency.

2176~~~
I maintain that he just isn't being used right.

2177~~~
This with the right players and system he would be a great player. Thought he was very good..  Love him can't doubt his enthusiasm and love for the club..

2178~~~
He's an excellent box to box CM. We'd be idiots to let him go. Which means we'll probably let him go.

2179~~~
He simply isn't utilised properly. He is the only central midfielder we have with a bit of dynamism.

2180~~~
I haven't been keeping an eye on rumours but I hope there is no talk of him leaving.

2181~~~
The latest rumour was from the dailymail that Atletico and Juve are interested in him, we are in danger of losing him, growing frustrated under LvG.

2182~~~
Surely he will outlast that dinosaur.

2183~~~
Any manager with a game plan could fit him in. We don't have a game plan. Nobody seems to know what they are doing.

2184~~~
Here's something you dont see everyday. Pogba for United and Herrera for Bilbao. Funny how football turns out.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdnG0v0W8AAAaZ3.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdnG0v0W8AAAaZ3.jpg"/>

2185~~~

2186~~~
Think they should just stop training. Hopefully nothing too bad. Need him available for the press conferences.

2187~~~
Just me who thinks he might be off in the summer? Could see him at the likes of Atletico.

2188~~~
I doubt it. He isn't good enough to start for them in any case. I think mourinho will want him as a squad player.

2189~~~
Our tempo in midfield picked up when he came on but he makes me nervous with how 50/50 he plays it in the double pivot.

2190~~~
So how many games before we see him again?  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2191~~~
His pass to Rashford for that counter was absolutely terrible.

2192~~~
Hopefully he will get a run of games with Morgan. Carrick's legs have gone and Ander and Morgan play well together. They should be replacing Carrick and looking for someone to form a trio with Ander/Morgan.

2193~~~
Did well today. Best I've seen him for a little while.

2194~~~
As some would suggest, he doesn't do anything that looks like hardwork to be ahead of Fellaini. 

Inspirational display to lift the game in the second half. Hope he gets better!

2195~~~
Helped pick up the tempo for us.

Would rather see him start and Carrick come on for him (than vice versa).

2196~~~
It was criminal

2198~~~
Not surprised to see Herrera join the racist debate.

2199~~~
Fecking racist cnut.

2200~~~
Nothing wrong with the comment but what is the black dot for..

2201~~~
Pacist.

2202~~~
Supposed to be a red dot emoji, but when you view it on a computer all emoji's are black and white. He tweeted the same thing here:

2203~~~
Right, thanks.

2204~~~
Someone said he was warming up for 20 minutes but didnt come on, then was angry? Whats that about?

2205~~~
Waste of space.

2206~~~
Poor in the first half but better in the second, looks like he's injured though so that'll be Rooney in on Saturday.

2207~~~
Looked terrible in that first half.

2208~~~
Closed down Antonio and created the turnover that led directly to the Rashford goal.

2209~~~
Touch was a bit off, but kept the ball moving quickly, at least. Hopefully was just an impact injury.

2210~~~
He needs games to be back to his best and knowing LVG he will never get that. Sad. I think he will leave at the end of this season. He is wasting his career.

2211~~~
He has been useless whenever hes played lately!

2212~~~
I think you will find he has been injured lately. He wasn't useless against Arsenal and has spent most of the time since injured. He needs game time. That formation last night worked, but you can guarantee that LvG will change it to make sure our friend Rooney can get ready for the Euros.

2213~~~
Was rusty but improved as the game wore on!

2214~~~
Love him. He's an intelligent player, well suited to a high pressing/quick transitioning team. Too bad LVG doesn't realise this.

2215~~~
The team doesn't suit him or at least his two midfield partners don't. However the same could be said of Mata. The difference is that Mata still makes sure the basics of his game are on point. Herrera won't ever be first choice here until he gets consistency in his passing game.

2216~~~
No he doesn't

2217~~~
Sounds like the Kagawa fan boyz spiel....Herrera has had chances and generally not looked great! Hence he's not an auto starter. Too bad Herrera doesn't realize if he shines when he gets a chance more chances will come.

2218~~~
Was one of our better CMs lasts season? I don't think hes been great this season, but so say hes had his chances and not look great is not true

2219~~~
So was Fellaini. Last season is last season.

2220~~~
You telling Mata's basic passing and touch isn't at least consistent?

Herrera's on the other hand isn't good enough often enough. Yesterday there were lots of little passes that reached a team mate but we're over/under hit or a foot off the floor.

2221~~~
We slate Rooney for giving the ball away cheaply so only fair others get it. He's been average at best I'm afraid this year, and I loved how he was looking last year. Don't know what LVG has done to him but Ander doesn't know who or what he is anymore

2222~~~
I really like his attitude and want him to succeed but either my memory of him being a potentially top player is totally false or he's really, badly out of form. He was very poor yesterday. I think I'm leaning towards 'not good enough' if I'm being honest. He's not good enough with or without the ball. He's energetic but limited.

2223~~~
I'm starting to have doubts. I've always liked his attitude but lately I'm starting to think he's just talking the talk. A disconnect between what he says (which is perfect) and what he does on the pitch.

2224~~~
I'm saying they both have games where their touch and passing is off, Herrera granted more often. However there have been a lot of games where Mata is easily dispossessed for fun.

2225~~~
You've highlighted Mata's weakness as a player. Just like Smallings is his passing, Martial's is his ball striking. That's not what we're discussing

I'm talking about a players bottom level. You know how they used to say even on a bad day Scholes was a 7. Well to a lesser extent it's the same with Mata. Having a bad game or played out of position his technique is still decent. It's rare you come away thinking Mata was wasteful today or his touch was poor.

How many times have we watched Herrera be really poor at the basics of the game? Plenty of occasions come to mind.

2226~~~
No because I am talking about him being easily dispossessed due taking a poor first touch, something which is basic. Forget his limitations as a player, he has also had quite a few poor games where even the basic things have been off.

2227~~~
Definitely. He seems to really get the club - as does Mata. Both of them conduct themselves well and seem like good professionals but neither of them has done enough to demand a spot in the team and both create problems when they play. I think we should be looking to replace the pair this summer.

2228~~~
Don't think I've ever seen anyone accuse Mata of having a poor first touch. It's consistently the best at the club.

He gets dispossessed because he's tiny and slow. Neither of which he can do much about.

2229~~~
The patience LvG shows for some players (Rooney, Fellaini, Mata) is matched only by how quickly he jettisons others, like Herrera. When he's been given a run of games, he's been good. And it's no coincidence the team plays better with him around. His cameo vs Everton was great and we moved the ball around midfield with zip and purpose -- and he never featured vs Spurs despite that game being suited to a high-tempo player like him, not Mata.

2230~~~
Herrera was not particularly impressive yesterday, but can you blame him?  He gets no run of games and has to play with Fellaini, Lingard et al who simply aren't United quality.  

When he gets his run he's very good, but it's a very fair question to ask just what we want from him as a regular starter that he can actually deliver.  The answer may not work in his favor.

2231~~~
This is ridiculous now. Both lingard and Fellaini were much better than him last night but Herrera isn't playing well because he was playing with lingard and Fellaini?

2232~~~
That just simply isn't true though. How is he patient with Fellaini but jettisons Ander when he plays Ander more? He also had a spell of about 7 starts in a row in January and it consisted of some of his worst performances in his time here. So this needs a run of games and is good when he does doesn't wash either. He has been poor this season and believe it or not, it isn't Fellaini's fault.

2233~~~
Spot on.

2234~~~
Good post.

2235~~~
Perhaps you should try reading the post you quote!  I wrote:


"He gets no run of games..." which means when he does come on, finally, it'll take a game or two hit top gear.  Like most players.

As for Fellaini and Lingard, let's not get carried away.

Fellaini did indeed have a good game by his standards but he's hardly the kind of true midfielder a player like Herrera can link up with to create scoring chances.  Fellani is a box-crashing attacking midfielder, a poor man's Andy Carroll.  Even his goal, a match-winner, was hardly a thing of beauty.  And take a close look at his defending on the West Ham goal...atrocious.

As for Lingard, I agree he put in a nice performance yesterday but Lingard is a level or two below Herrera.

2236~~~
You realise that with these varying criteria Herrera can't ever be blamed for his own performances. First of all it's down to not having a consistent run. When he does get that run of games it's then the fault of players like Fellaini and Lingard. He can't go wrong.

2237~~~
But I did blame Herrera for his poor performance, the explanation being that gets few minutes under LVG and was simply out of sorts in that first half.  Maybe he has a bad attitude or maybe he's always injured and thus gets no minutes.  But when you get no minutes and are suddenly brought on the pitch you can't expect top gear instantly. 

We've seen Herrera in top gear after a 3-4 match run and he's vastly superior to Fellaini and Lingard.  So I wouldn't "blame" Fellaini and Lingard for the poor play of Herrera in the first half but you can't expect Herrera to hit top gear with players who have poor pace, ability and vision (Fellaini) or limited experience and ability (Lingard).

One could, presumably, argue that if you put Messi next to Fellaini and Lingard that Messi would still be Messi.  Maybe, but I'm not so sure about.  If Messi had no played a full 90+ for months and only got a 10 minute cameo in his last two appearances AND he had to play with Fellaini and Lingard I'm pretty sure Messi wouldn't be peak Messi.  He'd be maybe 60% of peak Messi.  

Don't worry, I'm not suggesting that Herrera is the equal of Messi.  I'm only making the point to say that if you put even Messi under the same circumstances Herrera was put in yesterday Messi wouldn't be "Messi".  Herrera was poor yesterday, at least in the first half, and much of that can be explained by the total absence of match fitness, technically as well as physically.  When you compound that with having Herrera play with Fellaini and Lingard you're just not going to get a world class performance from him.  Fellaini and Lingard had fight in them yesterday didn't show any real class -- nor did Herrera -- but no caftards here make the case that Fellaini and Lingard are anywhere near the class of Herrera.

But Fellaini scored the match-winner.  That is a verifiable fact.

2238~~~
Yeah I still don't see where you blame Herrera for his own performance levels. You've just reiterated lack of game time and poor team mates.

2239~~~
We play better when Herrera plays end off..

2240~~~
Lack of game time explains, at least partly, his poor performance in the first half.  What's there not to get?

An alternative explanation is that Herrera is a shit footballer and that his performance yesterday in the first half is what one would expect.  I happen to disagree with that view but that's another way of explaining Herrera's performance yesterday.  

The reason I've reiterated the "lack of game time" thesis is that the previous post suggested that I put it all on Fellaini and Lingard, which is not the case.  I only mentioned having to play with Fellaini and Lingard IN ADDITION to Herrera's lack of game time.

Any footballer, either a god like Messi or a solid professional like Herrera, needs to play to maintain form.  You take players off the pitch, for whatever reason, for a month or so and they're going to need at least a half or maybe 1 or 2 games to regain form.

2241~~~
OK but blaming a lack of game time isn't blaming Herrera. You're putting it on LvG.

2242~~~
The easy way to settle this is that he was out of form and had a bad game below his usual standard.

2243~~~
Looked sharp when he came on and played some nice crisp forward passes.

2244~~~
I love him

2245~~~
Great cameo.

2246~~~
Excellent play for that goal.

2247~~~
Excellent. Very smart foul and an assist for the winner.

2248~~~
That cameo is him all over. Bit of a cnut and one inspired moment.

2249~~~
Love me some Ander

2250~~~
Not a fan of the foul at all. I hate fouls that are that blatant. I'd prefer a little kick than that shit.

There's nothing worse than handsy players when you play football. They should hire an official and equip him with a chainsaw to cut off any cnut who uses their arms.

2251~~~
It's much better to do what he did than go in with a challenge and risk hurting the opponent. It's easier to a shit tackle and more cnutish too. Barkley kicking out was a clear red.

2252~~~
It's why I love him. 

Was screaming at the telly for him to make that foul. I'd rather a Solskjaer-style hack than shirt pulling but it was smart to make the foul and take the booking.

2253~~~
Delofeu changed the game for them and Ander changed it for us. Lovely little cameo.

2254~~~
Me too. It'd be great to see him in CM under a new manager.

2255~~~
I'd prefer to be brought down like a man instead of a bitch. All he needs to do is give him a little kick or even a push.

2256~~~
This. Barley would have done the exact same thing and he knowes it.

2257~~~
All the people criticising him for the foul are probably the same peoples who'd give him pelters if Barkley scored.

Only disgrace there was Barkley's reaction, should have been off for that.

2258~~~
That just sums him up, doesn't it? He's a natural cult hero. Taking one for the team, and then hustling to assist the last minute winner. feck the haters, I love me some Ander Herrera.

2259~~~
I liked his assist, botched his back flick and fell over but was still thinking and stabbed it through. His fould on Barkley was smart too. He didn't risk injuring the player and stopped a break away. No way was Barkley getting sent off though, he is a top young English talent after all.

2260~~~
We need sone nastiness in our team.   I don't mind cnuts on the team who are willing to be a little bit nasty to win. Why is he slagged for dragging Barkley down from breaking at a crucial time (and when they have been looking dangerous on the break all game)?

2261~~~
Good foul, shirt pulling is always a yellow. If he kicks him, could be a red, depending on the foul and the ref. I rememebr Rooney a few years ago kicking a player from Villa i think, got sent off. His foot was a bit high, but it still wasnt malicious and a tactical foul. So i thought it was way more clever than kicking today.

2262~~~
The through ball was very good, but the foul was an absolute cracker. Absolute ideal time to take one for the team.

2263~~~
Exactly, kicking out always gives the ref an option of thinking it is too hard or too high and can send you off like Rooney. Shirt pulling is a yellow and will only ever be a yellow. Its the way smarter move.

2264~~~
He must be such a nuisance to play against, we need more players like him.

2265~~~
Brilliant foul.

2266~~~
I'd imagine he is always chattering in your ear as well.

2267~~~
His foul was excellent, had to laugh at the footballing purists in commentary complaining about it.

2268~~~
Thought he did ok today. The foul was needed but his play acting was ridiculous. Gor lucky for the assist but did well to prod it through in the end.

Still don't think hes good enough to be a starter for a team who want to win the league.

2269~~~
I have to admit those fouls annoy me as a rule, but it's about time we had a player with some cynical edge in there for us, and his reflex reaction to poke the ball through for Martial for the winner was great.

2270~~~
Clever player, the only one showing competitive intelligence when we were suffering. Our team is more naive than Arsenal u-16 and the ones with experience can't run to save their lives.

2271~~~
He's a pest for the opposition. Love him.

2272~~~
Why isn't he a starter ffs.

2273~~~
I think pull back is better option that kicking out to foul. When you go for a kick, you might get a Rooney red card type of foul.

2274~~~
Great little cameo capped off nicely by annoying Danny Murphy.

2275~~~
Deserves a lot of credit for that assist. Falling away from the ball and did very well to .are the pass.

2276~~~
I love anyone who annoys Danny Murphy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Can't help acting like a scouser can he?

2277~~~
Brilliant cameo. 

Amazing extra effort on the assist. 

I love our little Spaniard.

2278~~~
Great cameo, got the impact that was needed.

2279~~~
greatest through ball while falling on your Arse ever

2280~~~

2281~~~
Typical Wayne, even Carrick is overtaking him. Just joking.

2282~~~
If Danny drinkwater is good enough to be a starter for a title winning team then so is Herrera

2283~~~
There's nothing "like a man" about going for a tackle where your intention is just to stop play. Pull the shirt. That's it.

2284~~~
Ha, I was thinking the same. I was sort of agreeing with Murphy regarding playacting, but Herrera making a meal of Barkley's kick out made the referee take action. Without it, Barkley would have gotten away with being a petulant child. You just can't kick out like that, and Everton had done a few earlier with nothing said by the referee.

2285~~~
Loves a yellow card, indeed, the fella.

2286~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The BBC commentators saying he should have been sent off. I mean, yeah, let's just rewrite the rules as we go.

2287~~~
It is hilarious isn't it? Literally a week after complaining about a lack of consistency they want rules to be changed at the whim of the referee.

2288~~~
They just didn't want us to win. I know our manager is deluded, but he has walked the walk in his career. I couldn't have stood Martinez and his smugness. Yes he won a cup, but sent Wigan into a freefall they are just recovering from now.

2289~~~
You didn't correctly interpret what I said.

2290~~~
Yet if it was the other way round, they would want Ander off again and Barkley is showing that little bit of a nasty streak that is great in a player. I love the way Ander can wind people up.

2291~~~
Martinez is a spoofer. The moment I figured it out was when, at a time when Bayern converted Lahm into a midfielder, he suddenly started talking about playing Leighton Baines there. Didn't he make him watch other midfielders and all to get a sense of what they do. Literally no reason to do it - and, tbf, other than the hollow words, he didn't - other than the fact it was a bit of a thing for a few weeks because of Guardiola. Designed to do the square root of piss all other than show how clever and innovative the manager is.

2292~~~
Yet in his mind he should be managing a top club in Spain.

2293~~~
I loved his tackle just as much as his assist. Im always screaming for players on our team to do this when they are not on a booking and were caught on a counter in a 3 on 2 or 3 on 3 situation. Loved it.

2294~~~
Some commentator(Murphy?) couldn't stop criticising him for the foul and kept ignoring the replays showing Barkley's kicking after, showing bias against United and towards young english player, it was embarrassing. 

"<i>Unfortunately,</i> that's just yellow card", shut up you cnut. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2295~~~
Loved his foul on Barkley. A proper cynical move, he made sure there would be no counter attack. That's what we've lacked since Fergie went, a real hard nosed bastard attitude.

And then he pops up with an assist. Brilliant

2296~~~
Madness. I'd much rather be grabbed then have someone risk breaking my leg. Players who complain about a shirt pull like it's an attempt to imprison them in an attic for years are idiotic. I've never met one who wasn't severely lacking in basic intelligence.

2297~~~
He's a smart player who knew that Martial at full pelt had to be given a chance to run at goal, so when he messed up his flick, he was quickly able to stab the ball forward with a tackle/pass, since the objective was the same. It's the sort of thing that should make him our first choice in midfield, and would for a normal manager. We have one mobile, technically strong midfielder and we don't play him. It's bizarre.

2298~~~
Do you realize how silly that sounds when the likes of Cleverley, Ramirez and Barry have all been starters for title winning sides? This fixation with the idea that one only needs to be in Xavi-Scholes class to win league titles is ridiculous when pitted against historical facts of this league.

2299~~~
I don't disagree. But i still don't think hes good enough. People here have an obsession with him, but hes not proved that he is good enough. Definitely the most over rated player on the caf. Hes not good enough at any one thing to be a starter.

2300~~~
Good on schweini to teach him that particular skill. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2301~~~
Still not sure how he gets that through ball off whilst on his arse.

2302~~~
The thing with Herrera is, I wish more of our players had his attitude.

He's a fighter.

2303~~~
The thing is you can never have a team of Rio Ferdinands and Rooneys throughout the team, you will inevitably fill it out with not so great players around them. Herrera has enough about him, in the defensive and attacking phases, to have a role especially under a manager that believes in him and he hasn't got that from Van Gaal. Granted he hasn't had a good season, I don't think anyone would dispute that, but still he has shown enough to be kept around and whether he starts or not will up to what the manager decides he needs and whether he takes his chance when it comes.

2304~~~
He will be the player Mourinho dreamed Oscar to be.

2305~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.howlermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ezgif.com-optimize-73.gif" src="http://www.howlermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ezgif.com-optimize-73.gif"/>

2306~~~
Only time will tell i guess. A squad player for me. I'd like to be proved wrong though. I don't think our other midfielders have helped this season either. Weirdly its still an issue. I'd like to see two starting CM brought in this smer. Schweinsteiger and carrick out. Herrera, schneiderlin and two new players would stand us in good stead i think.

2307~~~
Given the amount of work needed in other areas I would keep Schweinstieger and sign one starting CM this summer and another next summer and let Schweini go then.

2308~~~
People will love the tackle because it's Herrera, but imagine if Fellaini did that, we'll never hear the end of it. It was a very lazy way of doing what he intended, it was almost comical. Still think he's a good player and should feature more, but he's not the saviour many on this forum often think he is.

2309~~~
Fair point on the Fellaini thing, but it was a good foul to concede. They were 4 against 3 at that point if I am not mistaken. Sure, Lukaku would have missed, but Herrera couldn't afford to risk that.

2310~~~
I don't know what the issue with the foul was, it's no different than a trip other than you can't pretend it was something else. It's just in game intelligence - knowing the rules and using them to your advantages. No cheating. The only issue you could have with Herrera is going down easy afterwards. I don't know why Barkley got so offended by it.

2311~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2312~~~
Yeah, because bringing a player down is going break his leg. ffs.

2313~~~
That people have a problem with the manner of his foul yesterday is embarrassing.

2314~~~
I agree with you, he did the right thing, i just thought he could have just stuck out a leg, the way he went about it was quite funny.

2315~~~
No, but it gives the referee an opportunity to dish out the red card. Would you have preferred that?

2316~~~
Don't think he's good enough to nail starts either as a CM or 10 but he's a decent squad option.

2317~~~
I don't think he was close enough to do that. Also, do you remember when Rooney did what you are suggesting last season against West Ham ? Got sent off. Why risk a Red when the simple thing was this. But yeah, was funny though!!
I dunno how it's being suggested as passionate like some posters here mentioned, but I do love him for it though.

2318~~~
He wasn't last man and it was high up the pitch. His first foul also.

Actually attempting to tackle the player and brining him down is better than such blatant feckery.

2319~~~
Bizarre examples. Rio and Rooney were the "not so great" players to Vidic and Ronaldo.

I love Herrera as a player. He is really intelligent with a great attitude. If he was better technically he would be top class. The assist sums him up. Saw the run, it was the right ball to put Martial through but he messed up the technically difficult flick. His determination got it through anyway and Martial won the game. I wish United had more players with his attitude.

2320~~~
Why is it better? You have any facts?

2321~~~
You obviously misunderstood me, Rio and Wayne were the great players whilst the likes of Park, Valencia, O'shea etc filled out the team and squad. Herrera is not perfect but he can be an important part of a successful team due to his attributes and tenacity.

2322~~~
It was four vs three and there was about two minutes left on the clock. Barkley was well inside our half and is more than capable of ending the match there and then. 

Embarrassing to think that some of our own supporters are displeased at the foul. There are no prizes for morality.

2323~~~
That foul got as a loud a cheer as Fellainis goal from the fans in the stadium. We were all screaming for him to take him down.

2324~~~
Squad player at best. Not sure why some are having a wank over his foul on Barkley. Nothing brilliant about it, common sense that's all it was.

2325~~~
Not about morality for me but we were wondering why he didn't just chase back and put in a normal tackle. He hadn't been on the pitch long, should have plenty more energy than Barkley. Just seemed a bit lazy.

2326~~~
It's something we rarely do, I made a thread about it a while ago. Our players seem usually too clean and would rather let them run away and score. Thank god he did it or it could have been 2-1 to them.

2327~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2328~~~
Not getting the fuss about the foul. At the time it happened I remember thinking "that's well done to break the counter attack". 
And then falling over and still managing to give an assist to the winning goal. what's the problem?

2329~~~
Does it matter? Barkley was ahead of him, is quicker than him and could have released the ball at any moment. It was a good foul in a good area of the pitch, there's nothing more to it than that.

2330~~~
Some weird discussion on here. Our fans seem to overanalyse every action in recent times to the point of being absolutely senseless. He made a tactical foul, nobody cares if he pulls the shirt or tackles him. Don know why some are offended that he did the former though.

2331~~~
It's fecking madness, to be frank.

2332~~~
Spot on.  Who gives a feck how he committed the foul?  The intention and purpose behind it remain the same and it was a smart play that had the desired effect.  No issue for me.

2333~~~
I suppose it doesn't matter. It just seemed odd to us at the time as we all thought he could have easily made a regular tackle.

2334~~~
Agreed, he is the type of player that Mourinho and Simeone seem to love.  His failings aren't due to a lack of application and fight, only in technique.  

Anyone moaning about that foul has an agenda or is stupid.  It was a proper tactical foul that anyone who understands the game will applaud, because it was the perfect move for that moment and broke up the play with no risk of missing a tackle and letting Barkley continue his run.

2335~~~
He's a genuinely dirty player is our Ander, "combative" to be politically correct. Still love him though.

2336~~~
It was a certain two v one on Dave of he didn't do that. IMO only a coward would have done anything different.

2337~~~
I remember Rooney in a similar situation last year against West ham tried to trip Downing up when they were about to counter attack but he misjudged it and ended up just kicking him and getting sent off.

By just pulling Barkleys shirt it meant he'd definitely stop the counter attack, and he made sure the ref couldn't send him off. It was a perfect act of cynical opportunism. I loved it.

2338~~~
Herrera talking about DDG, not sure if it's been posted anywhere.

2339~~~
I wonder if Ander gets this flak because he's clearly a fan favourite, the Stretford End sings his name every time they see him warming up. I think some fans dislike that Ander is adored for what they feel is no reason, and so they have a go at him if they have even half a chance. 

Exactly. I'm glad he did it too. Manchester United used to put winning first not being liked by everyone. Under Sir Alex we used cynical tactics when it was necessary. Why are people pretending like this wasn't the case? If anything the current United team has become too nice, too quick to roll over and have its tummy tickled. The other day I saw Keano saying second place was the same as last, nowadays we have people talking about 'getting fourth' as if there's a trophy for it. 

I think a lot of fans like Herrera because he reminds us of the way things used to be, and let's not forget he was the one who played Martial in for the winner too!

2340~~~
Bye Felicia.

2341~~~
Gash cameo.

2342~~~
Shockingly bad when he came on

2343~~~
For his sake, he should leave. 30 million pound midfielder can't start ahead of a Carrick, Fellaini and Rooney - 2 of whom aren't midfielders and one shouldn't be playing football, any more.

2344~~~
Worst player on the pitch today.

2345~~~
He was terrible when he came on, so many stupid errors.

2346~~~
He either plays from the beginning and let him get confidence or dont play him at all. Just sell him otherwise. Useless

2347~~~
Terrible

2348~~~
My favourite player in the current squad, but really bad in this game, and in poor form in general right now.

2349~~~
Some crazy comments here. Quick to forget that he was doing well enough before getting hacked out of the team. What do people expect from a player that needs a run of games yet gets a few minutes here and there under a stifling manager. Guys c'mon!

2350~~~
He is quite annoying when coming on as a sub. I think he is a player that needs to play consistently to erase those sloppy passes from his game.
We saw it last season in our good run of form.

2351~~~
Some sloppy passes but he tried a few things and he brings pace which was lacking at the time. I do think we went more on the front foot with his introduction.

Ideally he should have come on about 15 minutes earlier than he did.

2352~~~
fecked up every attack when he came on.

2353~~~
I would have brought him on for Jesse like last week. I think they will all benefit with LvG going to be honest. Fellaini was not that bad, so would have left him on and either brought Morgan on for Carrick or the undroppable Rooney. Mata and Herrera as someone said are not impact subs, they either need to start or at least get half a game, not minutes here and there. Herrera is playing now and again, same with Morgan, how are you supposed to build your form up like that? Fellaini might get his end of season rest like next season, so one place is up for grabs.

2354~~~
From his time at Bibao, he has always the type of midfielder to lift the tempo with quick and instinctive passes which means that there would be a higher percentage of sloppy passes than a slow possession game. When you bring him on as a sub in the second half when the whole team has gone from slow to ultra slow, what do you expect to happen? Before he settles down into the team's rhythm the game is over. When he starts a run of games, he tends to do well  but he is a scapegoat for LvG. Very unfair criticism from our fans.

2355~~~
The people who cannot take freekicks or corners do a good job of that as well. Oh, captains who insist on trying to lob the goalie don't help either. It was the usual good start to a game, but no planning made if that doesn't work.

2356~~~
You would think LvG with his so vast knowledge would know that, but he is all hot air and actually knows nothing of his players style of play. Bet Jose would know how to use an Ander Herrera. As someone said, if we weren't in the cup final LvG would be gone and good riddance.

2357~~~
He's not as good as people make him out to be. Him getting a run of games isn't going to ease him to perform at a significant level better. He's above average for this squad but average compared to the rest of the midfielders in Europe.

2358~~~
I'm not sure it's unfair criticism. 

Him not being able to settle into the tempo of the game as a sub isn't exactly a plus for him as a player.

I agree with everything else though.

2359~~~
I'm trying to think, has he ever had a good performance coming off the bench? I think he's better when he starts and he can grow into the game.

2360~~~
He did make the assist for the winning goal against Everton last week.

2361~~~
He did. You wonder what someone like Morgan is thinking, that this might have wrecked his Euro chances,  Darmian is thinking, when Rojo gets in all the time and was abysmal.

2362~~~
Fair point, although even that came from a terrible first touch that ricocheted between his legs.

2363~~~
He did well with that, actually messed it up, but still made sure Martial got the ball. As has been said, he will try things, so they won't always come off and if you are coming on as a sub it might show up more in a short space of time. I would rather have someone who will try something different than eternal crossers of the ball, bad free kick takers and pathetic corner takers, or even goalkeeper lobbers. Yes, sometimes it fails, but there are times it won't and we will benefit from that. The others are far to safety first for me.

2364~~~
Symbolic of our transition really, just hasn't been good enough like most of our signings.

2365~~~
It was, but others would have just waved their arms about and shrugged their shoulders, he made sure something came out of it.

2366~~~
One decent through ball and an interception in midfield that broke up an attack, but overall contributed very little when he came on.

2367~~~
Thought he looked poor, as he has been for most of the season. Hopefully he picks up under a new manager.

2368~~~
Would have been better if we had kept Fellaini on tbh. Herrera didn't contribute anything unfortunately. But agreed, 20ish minutes isn't much, can't expect him to perform consistently when he hasn't started a game in a while. But disappointed he didn't up the tempo like I thought he would, I was screaming for him to be introduced much much earlier.

Don't envy Van Gaal!

2369~~~
Our most overrated player imo

That said, LVG has probably mismanaged him the most since he's come in.

2370~~~
Yet the players seem quite happy with how they all played and thought they were the better side. Maybe we are being too critical. Not sure.

2371~~~
He did very little when he came on apart from lose the ball.

2372~~~
He is still a dilemma for me, he is still one of my favorite players in the Utd side, i feel he has been Van Gaaled. I remember his debut even though i couldn't watch it live, it was against La Galaxy he was the best player on the pitch i went through match thread here and everybody was drooling over him, then i downloaded the match and watched him, he was actually the best player on the pitch by a mile in fact there manager said after the match they couldn't deal with him and he is going to be some player. 

Then i think he was injured and played against QPR, he scored and was amazing again, and after a couple of matches there came the Leicester match, till 60th minute i thought he was amazing, and then the comeback and so on, my point is he had to sit out and adopt according to philosophy and somewhere along the lines i felt we have lost that player. He seems subdued now, he doesn't try dribbling anymore, he doesn't try through balls anymore, he is still rough and gives away the ball, but i felt that Herrera who tried alot of stuff in this team which is soo functional would have been great, but obviously according to the philosophy only wingers and strikers are allowed to dribble or try stuff, and keeping your position and passing will lead to chances eventually. I wish Mourinho will bring that unpredictability and spark he had back and allow him to express himself.

2373~~~
And you think Rooney was solid in the 2nd half? Yikes!!!

2374~~~
Get the feeling he's trying to do too much with his passing and trying to prove he's improved his range.

Like against Palace he was actually hitting some decent long passes wide. He needs to just stick to the basics a bit.

I won't resent him for a shit cameo after he's been pulled out wrongfully.

2375~~~
Carrick and Rooney both seem to be knackered into the 2nd half. In fact none of our players seem to keep up a tempo for a whole game. The first half an hour or so seems to go well, then they seem to drop off the pace of the game. What are they doing in training and are they conditioned properly? Keeping possession according to LvG was supposed to tire the other side out, how come it is us that it tires?

2376~~~
Big fan of Ander and wanted him to be the starting CM at the start of the season but it seems he's lost all of his confidence. Cameo today was apalling.

2377~~~
Solid = decent, average.

I didn't say Rooney had a banger.

And besides, how is that relevant to Herrera?

2378~~~
I remember his debut in pre season and thought the same. Really refreshing to have a midfielder who can do a bit of everything. However then came his second and third pre season game. I put it down to fitness but with hindsight there was a problem with his passing right from the start.

Some put it down to him taking more risks. Its true he does but his passing is erratic in general. You can't be like that as a midfielder in a club that wants to be at the top.

2379~~~
I think because he is getting pelters for a shortish cameo, when there were players who could have done more to finish the game off before subs were ever used. The subs were needed because other people didn't do their jobs properly. Fellaini might find himself out now for 3 games, as has happened previously at a seasons end. Rooney was not bad, but he sure as hell can't take freekicks, as can't Memphis as can't most of our team. Not one of them can take a decent corner, so teams just put the ball out as we are no threat from them. Oh and Rojo is drastically bad. There are a lot of things wrong, not just this lad. The biggest thing wrong is the man in charge who to me is completely off his rocker.

2380~~~
he is a bag of nerves it seems this year. He's finishing the 2nd half of the season where Rooney left off.

2381~~~
Problem is that Leicester are a very organised defence, Everton were all over the place. I think Ander is fine picking through balls against the all out attacking teams, Liverpool, City, Arsenal, Everton etc. What we need is someone who can unopen the awkward defences. We don't have that player at the moment. Ander is a useful player, but you would have thought by now the manager might have fathomed out how to get past these teams.

2382~~~
its not even that, these last run of games he has been on its really bad stray passes under no real pressure. He is a shell of who he was currently

2383~~~
He was fairly shit today, he looks like his confidence isn't there.

Has he had any reserve games since he came back from injury? He might be finding it hard to get match rhythm with the spells of being dropped and not getting many minutes since he got injured.

2384~~~
No he hasn't. Seeing LvG has always said they need match rhythm yet now has players coming back from injury and then has them sitting on the bench. Last season he had a couple of games with the U-21's and it did him good. LvG seems to be full of contradictions.

2385~~~
He isn't a sub player, he likes to up the tempo and move the ball as quickly as possible so he really needs his first touch and feel for the game to be perfect, it rarely works for him coming off the bench or if he hasn't got a run of games. Its poor management how many players in our squad are lacking match rhythm considering how often LVG talks about it, chopping and changing players almost at random doesn't end well.

2386~~~
Fair enough. I never said Herrera is the main problem in our team. I even cut him slack from my criticism by saying LVG has horribly mismanaged him.

2387~~~
I want to see him under any other manager here at United.

2388~~~
We would never know

Not as ashamed you would have been in Barkley had got into that box flopped on the floor and got them another penalty. Then everyone would have been screaming 'Why didn't he pull him down and take a booking'. He did exactly the right thing. Also he was having a laugh about winning tackle of the year.

2393~~~
Really? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How did you feel during the old United vs Arsenal games 10-15 years ago? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You must've hated some of Scholes and Keane's tackles!

2394~~~
There's a difference though. That pull back was just blatant cheating, there wasn't anything clever in what he did, nor did he try to hide it. 

The Solskjaer one I feel differently about, the guy would have scored, it was more in desperation. Herrera could have played better and not let Barkley waltz past him.

2395~~~
Heh? It was a tactical foul, get over it

2396~~~
No.

2397~~~
If you're in the UK:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b078xzgv/the-fa-cup-201516-everton-v-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b078xzgv/the-fa-cup-201516-everton-v-manchester-united</a>

2:09 onwards. It started off with a poor/underhit through ball from Rooney (as always, remember that Swansea game earlier in the season?), Carrick diving into no man's land and then Herrera seeing the danger (from the edge of Everton's penalty box no less), chasing back and bringing him down very cleanly.

Barkley was in full stride and was 5-10 yards away from being able to isolate Blind and/or give a through ball to Lukaku. If you want to analyse the situation further, Herrera had a couple of choices 1) he maybe could have made a tackle as Barkley first came across him but he probably would have had to go in with his weaker foot first (left leg) and thus would have less leverage as it's more unnatural meaning he would have probably injured Barkley or 'worst', not connect with the ball and let Barkley advance forward. 2) He could have chased Barkley further until he gets leverage to make a tackle, in which case a) that's assuming he can catch up to a fully in stride Barkley and b) by that time the foul would be nearer to the penalty box.

You're absolutely fecking mad to criticise Herrera in this situation.

It's mind boggling how people watch/view football here.

2398~~~
This and nothing else. Ever.

2399~~~
A tactical foul is a tactical foul, simple as, the Veratti one from this season is even funnier than herreras.

2400~~~
"Pang of shame" Jesus wept <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> get a grip.

2401~~~
It's a bloody disgrace he didn't dropkick Barkley in the spine and end his career, maybe life. 

That's what a damned proppa footballer would have done, wouldn't get into the Spurs side, that's for true.

2402~~~
Get over it.

2403~~~
Damn I got burnt.

2404~~~
Hero-ra more like!

2405~~~
Not the first to make the comparison, but the disparity between his performances and his reputation is probably worse than Kagawa at this point.

2406~~~
He's been one of the worst players on the pitch today, to bad Fellaini is suspended because he would be a huge improvement over this.

2407~~~
I blame the "Herrera is the most complete midfielder in the Pl" thread. All downhill since then.

2408~~~
He needs the team set up in a certain way for him to be at his best. And tbh his best isn't really good enough to warrant that happening.

2409~~~
He really hasn't been.

2410~~~
His final third passing is abysmal. 

There's a good reason he isn't the automatic starter everyone thinks he should be. 

Hopefully a new manager and system can help him out. He's not helped by poor movement and running ahead of him.

2411~~~
If we keep LvG, we need to cut our losses and sell him, alongside Rojo and company.

2412~~~
Not sure what is wrong with him. He'll pull of a really nice bit of skill and then whack a pass to nobody in particular.

2413~~~
I actually think he'd do well in a Lampard role if Mourinho was to come in and use the formation he used during his first stint at Chelsea.  Maybe with Schneiderlin in the Makelele role and Renato Sanches in an Essien role. But he's not suited to a 4-2-3-1.

2414~~~
One of the best players on the pitch today. That's not saying much. But he actually drives the ball forward and can do quick passing.

2415~~~
His performances often get sugarcoated. Very poor, again, today. Likable player, but he's really not that good.

2416~~~
He was average, quite a few very frustrating mistimed passes at crucial times today.

2417~~~
He blows hot and cold. Couple of brain farts, couple of good moments. He does bring energy in the midfield and is always works hard. Has a decent tackle as well. But yeah, I was a big Herrera fan but don't think he's as good as I thought he would be

2418~~~
So many poor passes. Disspointed with him. His decision making also let him down. Some good touches though.

2419~~~
So uhhh...

2420~~~
He's just not very good. I did try telling you...

2421~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmZswZoBers?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2422~~~
I actually think he'd be immense for you lot.

2423~~~
Highlight of Ander's Man Utd career, triffic stuff.

2424~~~
Like all your players weren't very good for Rodger's last year and a bit?

2425~~~
Not really, Ander's performances at Athletic Club didn't indicate he was good enough for you either.

2426~~~
In that case none of your current players are good enough for your club.

2427~~~
How's that? When you bought Ander you were a much better team than we were with bigger ambitions. We're a lot closer now but if you want to get back to being a title challenging team Ander Herrera has no place as a starting player.

2428~~~
Yeah but.. David Moyes.

The point is that barring Smalling, Dea Gea and Martial, none of our players look good enough for a title challenging team let alone a title winning one. I'm pretty sure, as is the case when a team  is being managed poorly, a lot of our players will look better next season. Whether that makes Herrera good enough for a starter, we'll see. But it's hard to judge all of these players when we're a complete mess. Besides, if he proves good enough for a rotational player in a title challenging team then I'll be happy.

2429~~~
Thought he was shocking today.

2430~~~
Schizophrenic performance, he's just so careless at times.

2431~~~
I think it's his final ball. Does so much so well but often screws up the last part.

2432~~~
I thought he was one of our better players today, alongside Valencia and Mata.

Picked up the ball in midfield and was able to carry it forward, tracked back well and nice link up with Mata. His final final passing was missing and he was sloppy at times but he had a static Rooney, quiet Lingaard and diabolical Memphis ahead of him. 

Under a better manager, in a better system he will shine. Personally feel Herrera and Mata are the two players most hurt by the set up under LvG.

2433~~~
Yep, he would fit in perfectly there.

2434~~~
Actually, it is why he hasn't played much under LVG. He is not disciplined enough to play in deeper positions or have a good passing accuracy/consistence to play in advanced roles often.

No amount of changing managers will sort it. He has to sort himself out if he wants to play more for United. Simple as that.

2435~~~
My guess is he'd probably do a lot better in a team that played on the counter more often with a more pacey attacking 3.  
It would be nice to see him play as the most advanced midfielder behind Martial, Rashford and non-existent high quality RW.

2436~~~
Except that he usually fecked some of our good counter attacks by messing all the passes around in last few games he played if you watched and remembered those.

Like I said, he needs to be able to pass better often to play anywhere in the midfield.

2437~~~
What on earth happened to him, for God's sake LVG has ruined so many players.

2438~~~
He needs to get a consistent run of games.  When he did last year we played our best attacking football we ever have under LVG.

Maybe that was an aberration, but I'd really like to find out.  This is a guy who thrived playing for Bielsa at Bilbao in a high pressing, more direct system.  We simply haven't played like that at all unless undermanned since LVG took over, which funny enough have usually been our more enjoyable attacking games.

2439~~~
Is Herrera missing for anyone else in the man of the match vote and match ratings? No sign of him on mine.

2440~~~
It's because of Martial's injury in the warm up. You can see he's on the list despite not playing. The whole thing is automatic so I guess it needs fixing.

2441~~~
Yeah but.. Louis Van Gaal. 

He's been well and truly vangled has Ander. Want to see him under a manager who actually encourages our players to play attacking football.

2442~~~

2443~~~
Agree with the last sentence but there's no excuse for being so sloppy on the ball.

2444~~~
Thought he had a horrible first half - didn't notice him much, but when I did, it was for the wrong reasons.

Much better second half where he made more runs - his link up with Valencia was very good.

2445~~~
He has been poor this season on the whole, There is no doubt about it. Unless a system is purpose built to suit his style I just struggle to see where he fits in the midfield. Think he might be in trouble next season with either Van Gaal or Jose (although that probably won't happen anyways).

2446~~~
Biggest disappointment (player wise) of the season for me. He's not been the worst but I had such high hopes. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2447~~~
Average player.

2448~~~
I agree. I'm hoping he flourishes when we move to a quicker tempo and better cohesion. But he has been a big disappointment this season regardless.

However, to be noted that I wasn't actually laying the "Herrera blame" on Moyes' doorstep. Herrera didn't even play under Moyes.

My point was in response to this:

Which is not true. When we bought Ander Herrera we had finished 7th in the league and weren't the force we were pre-SAF retirement.

2449~~~
Shit player.

2450~~~
How does Fellaini get so much shit and this guy gets away with everything? After Di Maria, one of the worst signings in the clubs history.

2451~~~
The Basque Allen.

2452~~~
Really looking like a total waste in this match.

2453~~~
I like him,but he's been non existent here.

2454~~~
He's crap but just like Mata as he's a "nice guy" gets away with murder.

Problem is we have too many nice guys.

2455~~~
He's lucky that he didn't play next to someone like Keane. He is spineless and loses every 50/50.

2456~~~
I think we miss Fellaini tonight.

2457~~~
Get him the feck off the pitch, he's been a sack of shit.

2458~~~
Get Carrick on for this passenger.

2459~~~
Because he's likeable.

2460~~~
He's been terrible this season. Don't think he knows what he's supposed to be doing.

2461~~~
Doing Allen a disservice there.

2462~~~
Has had a bad season.

2463~~~
I've stuck up for him a lot in the past

But he has been shocking, A little pussy out there. Disgraceful effort

2464~~~
For a supposed technical player he can't pass or control a ball for shit.

54.6% passing, brilliant.

2465~~~
On paper Schneiderlin - Herrera looks like a brilliant combo.

Too bad it's complete shit in real life.

2466~~~
Me too, what's he good at again?

2467~~~
He looks overwhelmed tonight!

2468~~~
just poor, hopefully new manager and new system will help him or he's out

2469~~~
Quite a few things when he's playing well. Looks devoid of all confidence and has done for 12 months

2470~~~
LOL if people still think he'd walk in the Barca team. He's just plain average.

2471~~~
I have no idea where his best position is?

2472~~~
So many stray passes.

2473~~~
I've been saying he's shite for quite some time now. I even had a thread called "I hate Herrera". Now gone?

And people blame LVG when we have garbage like Herrera on the pitch.

2474~~~
On the bench.

2475~~~
Pretty much yeah, a nothing player.

2476~~~
You can say what you want but thisnpleb isn't close to being good enough. Fellaini has been better this season.

2477~~~
Fecking woeful today.

2478~~~
Become a liability today.

2479~~~
He's just being who he is. He's no better than this.

2480~~~
Having a bit of a nightmare today.

2481~~~
I agree. He plays like this far too much. He's not the standard required.

2482~~~
Closet West Ham fan?

2483~~~
He's a really average player. Ridiculously overrated on here. Or used to be at least.

2484~~~
Spineless pussy, he is the epitome of what is wrong with this team.

2485~~~
Very poor tonight. 

But he is not as bad as he's shown tonight.

2486~~~
not good enough to pick every week with this set up

2487~~~
I love Herrera but he was absolutely brainless tonight. Ridiculous number of fouls to give away.

2488~~~
Terrible performance. In a game like today, we needed everybody at it and he's let us down.

2489~~~
Poor performance from a player I like and I blame LvG for keeping him on for as long as he did

2490~~~
A fecking horrendous performance tonight. 

He was appalling with the ball, he seemed to be stumbling about losing his footing constantly. And the amount of stupid fecking free kicks he gave way was just moronic.  Eventually cost us big time.

He's had a really poor season but tonight was especially bad.

2491~~~
Shocking performance. I am far from Rooney's biggest fan, but I thought it was unfair Rooney got the stick he did at half time when Herrera was much worse.

2492~~~
Complete crap season from him. He tries though and he's enthusiastic, but he's just been ordinary.

2493~~~
Along with Schneiderlin, I'd get rid in the summer.

Terrible performance and not the 1st this season.

2494~~~
Abysmal. Absolutely brainless the amount of free kicks he gives away and not just tonight

2495~~~
His United career in a nutshell, that match. Piss off Herrera.

2496~~~
0/10

Atrocious is being kind.

2497~~~
I like him a lot, but was rubbish today. Absolute waste of a space. Gave away far too many fouls one of which eventually led to a goal

2498~~~
Probably my favourite player, but have to concede he was brainless tonight. I'm sure even an inept twit like van Gaal will have urged these lot not to give away stupid free kicks. He gave away at least 4.

2499~~~
Can't believe he was kept on. Carrick should've replaced him, not Schneiderlin. Awful decision making from Van Gaal <b>YET AGAIN.</b>

2500~~~
Needs to be the first one out the door after LVG.

2501~~~
He lost us the game tonight by giving away those free kicks and being generally shit. We couldn't handle their aerial threat.

2502~~~
Too big for him.

2503~~~
The biggest annoyance of the night. Kept giving fouls away and in the end they got that goal.

2504~~~
Nah. First out should be Rojo.

2505~~~
He's been utter garbage for a few months now, might be best to just sit him out for the rest of the season.

2506~~~
He is not a pussy though. In fact, he is almost opposite. It seemed like he was up for it but couldn't control his emotion to do anything right.

The amount of fouls he gave away was ridiculous. As a whole, we should have let them pass around. They were not even that good except for all the high balls coming in.

2507~~~
Used to love him as a player but he isn't suited to the league IMO

2508~~~
If I didnt hate Rojo so much I'd be venting all my anger in here right now.

2509~~~
Him to, never before have I disliked so many United players, not even when Moyes was in charge.

2510~~~
As I've always said on here, he's not as good as many of you keep telling yourselves he is. He's ok sometimes, and offers nothing most other times. What does he specialize in? A jack of all trade midfielder who is a nice guy, so, gets a lot of leeway because of that reason. As for actual football, he's nowhere near top class. His performance today though was the lowest of low, kept giving away freekicks in dangerous area, what sort of brainless person does that?

2511~~~
We would have lost nothing by keeping hold of Tom Cleverley and keeping this chancer in Spain.

2512~~~
Of course he is, he's just not very good. Should be playing along side Cleverly at Everton.

2513~~~
He is one of the players who likes to talk a lot, but in reality randomly delivers where and when it matters on the pitch. Disgraceful performance, absolutely shocking. You would think that was his first professional game at this level. Naive and stupid out there, stealing a living currently.

2514~~~
Really thought he was an intelligent player before - was good in his first season and has turned to shits this season. 

Absolute shit today. Brainless fouling all around our box. Either he is really shit or he wants LVG gone.

2515~~~
I think he's a good player, who will improve under a better manager. He was much better in his first season.

If we persist with LvG Herrera should probably leave though,

2516~~~
I'm pretty sure he was actually in a paralel universe tonight, which was occuring 5 seconds after events on this earth were actually happening. That's the only way to explain his constant fouling and wayyy overhit passes.

... actually no its not... he was probably just doing his best Fellaini impression.

2517~~~
He has regressed so much this season from last season, it's absurd. Didn't we have a thread last season arguing that he was the most complete midfielder in the EPL? Tom Cleverley or Darren Gibson would have been much more useful than him tonight.

2518~~~
He's so average. The club should just put him out of his misery, and send his belongings back to Bilbao. 
No top manager building a top side would like him.

2519~~~
Nah he's a kidder when it comes to the physical stuff. Quite clever at making himself look up for a battle but when it comes to a 50/50 my money's on the other bloke.

2520~~~
Disappointed. I was raving about him last season but what an awful performance. Bullied by opposition players and poor on the ball.

2521~~~
Cowardly display I'm a fan of Herrera but he looked like he shit himself tonight

2522~~~
Complete lack of discipline. 

Not even Fellaini would've given away that many free kicks (and probably would've won the midfield too).

2523~~~
His worst performance in a United shirt

2524~~~
I just couldn't believe how many free kicks he gave away. It was fecking unbelievable, you'd think anyone with half a brain would have realised they were going down under any contact and that cnut ref would give them a free kick.

And yet time after time he was lunging in needlessly or barging into them.  

Awful performance and all round an awful season for him.

2525~~~
Never given anyone a rating of 1 since I joined RedCafe but that's what he got from me tonight. Absolutely atrocious performance. He actually hindered us by being on the pitch.

2526~~~
He was terrible and ill-disciplined which makes you wonder why he lasted as long as he did. Been disappointing this season.

2527~~~
I think that's probably the worst performance he's ever had in his whole career. He looked like a competition winner who couldn't keep up with with the speed and physicality. Mata showed more fight and determination than he did!

He was great last year, but he's really disappointed me this season.

2528~~~
Defo his worst performance as a United player. Normally he can pass under pressure with both feet, but today he couldnt. But more so than that, he gave away some daft daft free kicks in dangerous positions. One which eventually lead to a goal.

2529~~~
That most complete thread was almost as moronic then as it is now, in fairness.

2530~~~
Looks like his head has completely gone.

2531~~~
He's had a woeful season. I don't think he's got much of a future here either

2532~~~
Him, that cnut "Morgan" and Depay would be first out the door for me. 

Herrera, to his credit, is a good player. But, you aren't going to win leagues with the likes of him

2533~~~
Wasn't it made by a very respected poster here too?

2534~~~
He's turned into the kinda player we easily laugh at. He's pointless, can't control, can't pass and concedes a stupid amount of dangerous FKs.

2535~~~
Well, I just have to say it again that it was ridiculous with the amount of fouls he conceded. And a lot of them were near our box. Of course WHU players made a big deal about most fouls to get some free kicks. Ander should have been a bit smarter.

Also, as much as LVG is being shit, can people blame him for not playing him as much? Some of us actually suspected that LVG does not like his positioning and lack of disciplined in deeper positions. Though it didn't matter today as he was fouling the feck out of everyone near our box anyway.

2536~~~
I saw through Herrera a long time ago. Tried to convince myself that he could make the step up but has no range of passing, can't tackle and doesn't look after the ball well enough. We have been fooled by a few fancy touches into signing a mid-table La Liga player I am afraid.

2537~~~
He's regressed massively under Van Gaal.

2538~~~
A rotten performance last night. His worst for us by a distance. I still think he has a lot to offer us though. It's been a season to forget for the whole team. We have no stand out performers other than Martial. No cohesion or resemblance of a team. It's been difficult to judge the majority of the squad, and if they are just sapped of all confidence and motivation under the manager or if they are poor players. I still maintain the squad is better overall than it is currently performing.

2539~~~
Weak and ineffective. Simply hasn't got the dynamism to be a Utd player.

Get rid.

2540~~~
My biggest concern is he seems to have the creativity driven out of him by Vangle who constantly kept dropping him last season for trying to pull off risky passes.

2541~~~
Well summed up. I was fooled but no longer and, after last night, I've had enough. A miserable performance.

2542~~~
I get that nobody likes the manager but at some point you have to look at these players and say regardless of who is in charge, are they "United" players? I would love Herrera to do well, has a great attitude but like I said in my post earlier, what attributes does he have which meet the standards requires at Utd? Doesn't have the passing range of a Scholes or even Carrick/Rooney, doesn't dominate a midfield like a Keane/Robson/Ince and doesn't have the pace or dynamism around the box to be a significant attacking threat. I imagine he would be a fantastic 5-a-side player but unfortunately unless he fancies turning out for Inter Me Nan on a Monday night at Powerleague don't know what use he is

2543~~~
He looks a shadow of the player we saw in the second half of last season. Frail, ill-disciplined, unintelligent, inconsistent technique, inaccurate passing; Just a miserable performance.

2544~~~
He's a player I've wanted to do well on account of his attitude but the more I watch him the less I think he has the necessary quality.

He's a player who no doubt looks very neat and tidy in a good side in a league like Spain where there's not as much pressure on the ball. Here everything looks rushed and hurried - although a lack of quality around him won't help.

2545~~~
If we'd had a Keane-type leader on the pitch when Noble carried him off the pitch a few weeks ago, and Noble had had more than just the physio to deal with, maybe Herrera would have been better last night when back face to face with Noble. I know he was sh!t but I look for reasons. I think we really need a strong character in the engine room. Someone like Keane or Robson would be brilliant but that is just so very far from what we have now. It would help players like Herrera play with more composure and confidence.

2546~~~
He's been our worst player every time in the last few games. He needs to get his shit together.

2547~~~
I was hoping he'd be our little terrier in midfield, full of energy and able to pick out a killer pass. Couldn't be further from the truth. Unbelievable how many needless free kicks he was giving away last night, and against West Ham, who live for set pieces. Blind had a terrible game, yet Herrera was easily the worst player on the pitch.

2548~~~
I don't mind fouling people without getting booked too much. It is an art and Ander is good at it. 

But, he gotta realize there for that match that our defenders were getting ownt, their strength was set pieces with their height, we had no one to deal with it properly and they will draw a foul for it etc.

And, he didn't. Which was surprising given how intelligent he sounds. 

Tbf, even BFS was being dumb against Arsenal. I suppose it happens. Just that at very wrong times for ander.

2549~~~
He shows nothing of the good things we saw in the beginning. He also used to be a smart player

2550~~~
Yes, I am really disappointed in him after last season. He is having shocking season, if he was playing for other team I would laugh at him how bad he is. And I am his fan.

I just think he is stupid in general, his interviews, his reactions on the pitch, I like the guy but still he really looks dumb at times.

2551~~~
Right now, he's offering nothing, I appreciate that. We have seen plenty of good from him though, and when he's on it and playing with confidence, he's a very useful player for us. His short passing is quick and incisive. He often gives our play a higher tempo and he's good at playing the ball in tight spaces. I like how when he receives a pass, he would nearly always turn towards goal and continue moving forward. Last season we saw he was also a goal threat, and can strike the ball cleanly and accurately.

We saw a lot of that in the first few months of the season too, but he has dropped off significantly, and he looked utterly useless last night. As stated, what makes it hard to judge him individually is that the majority of the squad have completely dropped off as well, bar Martial and De Gea, and arguably Smalling. It's hard to tell if the players just aren't playing, or are genuinely poor. I'm staying positive and believe it is more of the former.

2552~~~
Everyone seems to have regressed under LVG, he's looking lost on the pitch, like almost everyone else he also takes to much time on he ball and overthinks what to do.

Would like to see him under other manager, think he would look much different player than this one atm.

2553~~~
Such a disappointment last night. Hindsight is wonderful but he really should have been hooked immediately at 1-2.

2554~~~
He runs around a lot.

2555~~~
A more mobile Anderson minus the cool hair.

2556~~~
If he played shit last night because he was scared to face Mark Noble again then he's not a character we want around the place.

Was annoying last night when he was desperate to kick the ball out of play when a West Ham player got injured, after what happened with Noble last time out. I was losing the plot when he did that.

2557~~~
One of the most likeable players i really want to see succeed at United but my faith in him is starting to dwindle. Yesterday he was completely hopeless and made me realise how much we missed Fellaini (which should never happen)

2558~~~
I wish Fellaini was fit. Ander was a pure liability last night. The man should be smart enough to know that we struggle to defend set-pieces, which West Ham are good at. 

The amount of free-kicks he gave away were incredible. Atrocious performance. 
At the end of last season I said our fans overrate him quite a bit and although I think he's a good player, he's nowhere near as good as some of our fans make out. People were screaming we should build the team around him? Absolute nonsense.

2559~~~
I also hope he can improve under different manager but I think some players have actually regressed, or stoped developing at important age during these past 2 or 3 years considering our shite football under both managers, which could lead them to never fullfiling their potential.

2560~~~
Can only hope that's not the case <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Really like his understanding with Mata, he's shiwed that can play much quicker and has both good passing range and nose for goal when coming to the box or around the box. But as are the others under LVG he looks too restricted and conservative atm which makes him and the team worse than they really are.

2561~~~
Last year's Herrera from start of the season was great midfielder for me, but once van Gaal started teaching him some methods(they literally said that) because he didn't like his style of play, he was never the same player again for me, even though he played some good football towards the end of season, but was never that exciting.

2562~~~
Basically not that good. But getting away with it as the manager is just as bad.

2563~~~
Fellaini has been much better than him this season.

2564~~~
Exactly, he's been misguided and it's clear as day. Hope he'll turn it around next season!

2565~~~
There might not be another season for Herrera at United. I don't think he is enjoying his football here and if LVG stays, i am sure he will quit.

2566~~~
Is he a Mourinho type player?
Does he have the athleticism which Jose requires in his midfielders?

2567~~~
He's no less athletic than Fabregas  or Oscar. He's definitely combative.

2568~~~
I think, along with most the squad, he is totally shot of confidence.

He seems to misplace every other pass. Simple, 3 yard passes.

He caused several West Ham counter attacks by giving the ball right back to them when all our players were pushed up. So careless and sloppy.

Looks a totally different players as to the one who joined us. I can only put that down to self confidence which Van Gaal has most likely played a major part in. 

Alright, the manager might have coached Herrera's expressiveness, followed by confidence, out of him, but the player is constantly making fundamental errors which he has to take a large chunk of the blame for.

2569~~~
He was the worst player on the pitch last night.

A pitch that included Marcos Rojo.

2570~~~
Yeah but in a headless chicken sort of way.

2571~~~
He's having a rubbish season. He's overrated on here, but he's better than this, he was beyond last night. Don't understand how he kept giving fouls away, was shocking

2572~~~
Even as a big fan of Herrera he had a bad game and it was obvious that he is void of confidence but I am also going to point the finger at LvG. It was clear the lad was struggling, yet you refused to leave him on for long periods while he continued to struggle. A manager like Klopp, would have have pulled out a player that was struggling to avoid further damage to their performance and confidence. It is clear LvG does not like him at all IMO.

It's funny when Herrera is on form, he drops him and when he is struggling he leaves him on. 

That said, Herrera needs to really pick himself up, he is not as bad as what we have seen so far.

2573~~~
Don't mention Fabregas and Herrera in the same sentence......worlds apart!

2574~~~
I do agree he's better than what he's been showing, but he's still very overrated on here.

2575~~~
Spanish tom cleverly

2576~~~
Just said this about Schniederlin too - he shouldn't be judged on this season. Almost no player has looked good under LVG bar Smalling, Martial and DDG. Memphis, Schniederlin, Herrera, Darmian etc should all be given another season (hopefully) under a new manager before we decide to get rid.

2577~~~
So Herrera shouldn't be judged under LVG, but Rooney and Fellaini and Januzaj should be on these forums? I am not arguing your point. I do think he is better than what has been shown by him under Van Gaal but it's unfair not to criticize him when people tear into the other players. 

And as a side note, he wasn't that special of a midfielder to begin with in my opinion but like I said much  better than this.

2578~~~
Except Schneiderlin was established as a quality premier league midfielder prior to joining us.

2579~~~
Ok.

2580~~~
He should be our backup next season. Not good enough to start irrespective of the manager.

2581~~~
Whats happened to Herrera recently?? Is it just confidence (not something I ever imagined him being short of), or is he just tired after a long hard season. Whatever the reason he's been disappointing in the run in. Hasnt hid, so credit for that, but very much a headless chicken

2582~~~
Rooney has been here nearly 10 years now so it's not like we don't know what he's all about. Fellaini has been in the league forever so we know a lot about him too. I get your point but I'm mostly on about newer players. Januzaj should not be judged on this season either, granted his spell at Dortmund and what Tuchel had to say about him doesn't bode well.

I just think a majority of the new signings deserve more time, if we were going to get rid of all the disappointing players in our squad from this season we'd be left with Smalling, Martial and DDG.

2583~~~
no its been for months, even coming on as sub. Stray passes under no pressure, his season is a write off. He might remember who he is if gets away from LVG

2584~~~
Agree with others, big fan but he has been total shite recently, which is saddening. 

The obvious thing to say is EVERYONE in the team will improve massively under a more pro-active manager but for me, Herrera is the type of player that would be putting in world class performances under Mourinho, Poch, Simone and Pep. For me his skillset is too good not to utilise and build around/let him get consistent.

2585~~~
He's just not at that level, and it's a sad state of affairs if you build around a player as average as Ander Herrera is. He should be a squad player, if he's happy enough with that, nothing more.

2586~~~
His performances this season warrant an average tag but my opinion is that he's a very well rounded player playing in a dsyfunctional team with dinosaur regressive tactics.

A midfield is built through good combinations and tactics. You can't just go out and buy Pogba/Verrait/Gundogan, put him in the team and expect him to run the midfield. Xavi didn't run Barca's midfield on his own, neither did Pirlo, Scholes, Zidane etc. Kante can only perform as good as his partner Drinkwater and their tactics allow that (sit deep, concede possession and break up plays before the first move into the centre of the pitch) etc etc). We rely on a Carrick, who is only happy to sit at the base of his midfield when we don't have the ball (so basically in a 3 man midfield, you have one less person to press and get into pro-active tactical shape), Rooney, who doesn't have the ability on the ball to receive in those pockets of space and is only intent on...sitting back and spraying balls (like Carrick, but at least Carrick can do it better) and then we rotate everyone else to accomendate those two.

A manager like Poch would be getting Herrera and Schneiderlin to be doing all the dogs work in the middle of the park to let players like Rashford and Martial thrive. Except LVG is telling his players to spread the ball wide hoping we'll break teams down not taking chances and having belief in your players in the centre of the park with more deft touchses and inter plays.

2587~~~
He's looked like a bit of a square peg in a round hole in some ways in our midfield this season. He's not good enough at what he's being told to do and he's suffered because of it.

I don't think he's a 'worldbeater' but he's shown in his career he's a good player. I think he'd be better in a team pressing more in groups.

Looks absolutely shot of confidence though and he was just playing stupid against West Ham. Kind of feel he needs the season to end and get a fresh start in August.

2588~~~
Caf delusion in regards to Herrera in a nutshell.

2589~~~
Another player who has continuously gotten worse under Van Gaal. Di Maria got out at the right time.

2590~~~
This is the harsh reality.

2591~~~
He's been really poor this season.

He strikes me as a sort of upmarket Cleverley where people will defend him for not playing a system to suit his 'style'. What that style is i'm not sure. He can't tackle, has a limited passing range and isn't particularly quick. He's not good enough to play in a central two and he doesn't have enough skill/guile to play the role number 10 attacking midfield.

The only thing he guarantees consistently is a cheap yellow card and a half-arsed dive in a lame attempt to win a pen.

2592~~~
The thing is even the things he was good at, he is now shit at. If he leaves and returns to Spain, they won't recognise him. May take him 6-12 months to restore himself

2593~~~
Unfortunately you may be talking to a brick wall regarding Herrera on here. Not too long ago many were saying that Fellaini has had as bad a season as him, which is absolute bullshit.

2594~~~
He was our best outfield player last year, yet LVG didn't like his game and told him to change. He looks a nervous wreck now

2595~~~
Not sure whether it means anything but it seems he wasn't involved in the new kit photoshoots, and being an adidas athlete along with De Gea, Mata, Shaw and Lingard (who all had pictures) you'd think he would be.

2596~~~
He wasn't.

2597~~~
He had his best spell last season after van Gaal told him to change his game so that doesn't wash at all. He has been careless in possession and struggles to connect simple passes this season, not van Gaal's type of game at all.

2598~~~
I am an Ander Herrara fan and will usually defend him because even when playing badly he always continues to get stuck in, tries to drive the team forward, tries to actually play a pass with a bit of vision and actually looks like he gives a feck. 

Tuesday's performance was indefensible however.

2599~~~
He would excel with a different type of manager in my opinion. Not many midfielders could look good playing for Van Gaal.

2600~~~
If we only had this season to judge him on then he wouldn't have any support for staying here next season.

He had some very good performances last season, along with the odd poor one, but doesn't look close to the same player at the moment. We can speculate as to the reasons why but he needs to drastically improve pretty quickly if he wants to be at the club much longer.

If LVG stays, he may as well look for another club this summer.

2601~~~
Really good player ruined by LVG, still have high hopes for him.

2602~~~
He'd possibly do better with a 'different' manager, but he probably wouldn't even get into a 'top' manager's side.
He's a squad player for a top team with their sh!t together.

2603~~~
Just like Kagawa eh......just not any manager in the PL.

2604~~~
If we get Mourinho, he will be fine. Or sold.

2605~~~
No. Not like Kagawa. He has a bit of steel in him.

2606~~~
If he was a squad player for us as a top team then I'd be delighted. First of all, it would mean that we were a top team. Secondly, it would mean that we had some decent alternatives.

2607~~~

2608~~~
He's had a shocking season, especially given the expectations we had for him.

2609~~~
Been really poor this year.

2610~~~
The feck he was doing during that Bournemouth goal... was he fouled ?

2611~~~
Yeh hard to argue against anyone saying he's been poor and I'm sure he will know that. Too soon to write him off tho as he was top class on his first season and still shows glimpses of a gem within. Let's get Mounrinho in, play some quicker football and this lad will truly thrive.

2612~~~
He wasn't top class in his first season, not even close. He wasn't even first choice for a lot of it.

2613~~~
Still think hes a very talented player who will come good under better management. He's one of the many who have underachieved this season.

2614~~~
I think it''s 50/50 whether he remains here after the summer.

2615~~~
True, hard to look pas LVG when so many of our players have underperformed.

Few have underperformed as much as Herrera though.

2616~~~
Needs to learn about the "play to the whistle" thing you learn about when you're a kid. Far too often he goes to ground or just stops and expects a foul to be called, even if he can keep going with the ball to create something or things like today when the opposing player is in the box to make a chance.

2617~~~
Talks the talk but on the pitch the guy needs an overhaul. Getting carried off by Noble, the play acting, whatever that was for the Bournemouth goal. We talk about Depay needing to change his attitude but in a different way so does Herrera.

2618~~~
Hard to disagree, especially given the expectation and talent.

2619~~~
Ok perhaps not top class but he had more than enough top class performances and momenta to suggest that he's got a level more than he's ever shown at Utd. A good attacking manger should be able to reignite the best in him and more I think.

2620~~~
He's been such a disappointment. If Mourinho comes in, is he safe this summer? I'd question it.

2621~~~
He's not brilliant at anything and is not strong or fast. A good player, at times very good. Should be a squad player in an ideal world. Or maybe he will thrive under a new manager. I hope.

2622~~~
The season has been a complete and utter write off for him.

He needs to pick it up, and soon. He's not particularly young

2623~~~
With Fellaini's suspension he really had a chance to force himself into the F.A Cup starting XI. His performances have been poor though and I can't see it happening. Although who knows with LvG.

2624~~~
Squad player at best.

2625~~~
He was so promising at times, what on earth happened?

2626~~~
I thought he was one of our best players last season - wouldn't say he was one of the worse this season, but one of the most disappointing. If LVG stays he should go - otherwise I'd like to see what another manager does with him.

2627~~~
Still think he's talented enough to claim a spot in this team. Mourinho would love him, I think.

2628~~~
He didn't play in the final but it was great to see how happy he was about us winning the Cup. He was like a fan. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2629~~~
I said a page or two back that he would be putting in world class/very good performances under Mourinho and I'm gonna stand by that decision.

Mourinho is actually kind of lucky to have a VERY strong backbone of technically proficient and consummate professionals to work with this summer...that are NOT going to the Euros, so they are going to be fit, fresh and roaring to go in August. 

Valencia, Blind, Herrera, Mata, Depay, Lingard, Shaw, Schneiderlin, Young (ugh shudders) along with having the opportunity to see first hand Januzaj, Perreira, TFM, Wilson etc etc. 

If they get the chance, which I think they will (because I doubt Mourinho is going to come in and rip apart the team), everyone there will have a point to prove. 

It's kinda like LVG's first pre season but unlike LVG, Mourinho will know how to man manage and get the best out of his team already without needing to drop and change every game.

2630~~~
Had a bad season no doubt, cant deny it but I genuinely think he is a really good player and would excel under Mourinho IF he plays a 4-3-3 which suits our set of players anyway. LVG's style was way too slow and meticulous for Herrera who bases his game on dynamism, quick play and instincts. Hes very clever on the ball, can score goals and will run all day and help out defensively. Mourinho would love him imo if he plays him in a 4-3-3. If we play a 4-2-3-1 then you may aswell sell but him pogba and schneiderlin in a midfield could be something else, especially with our current forward line

2631~~~
------------- Schneiderlin-------------
-----Herrera------------Pogba-------
Mkhitaryan------------------Martial
-------------------Zlatan----------------

This is how we should line up. Keep saying that.
Damn! I am getting too stuck in to the Pogba thingy

2632~~~
Spot on exactly how I would line up. Good lad

2633~~~
I think Jose will invest in our midfield, so he will face even more competition. He needs to show us his very best form and improve, otherwise I believe it will be his last season

2634~~~
Whenever Herrera's been at his best, it was usually when he was playing fast paced, high octane football under Bielsa and thereafter Valverde. (I didn't watch him as often under Valverde tbf). There was a lot of movement, pressing and directness.

So it's been very little surprise that he's struggled under LvG's football, which is almost the polar opposite. A slow possession based system which was very rigid/disciplined in it's execution. I think Herrera, in his first season, mentioned as much - about the differences between Bielsa and LvG and how he's needed to adjust.

I'm not absolving him from blame, or saying it was LvG's fault because sometimes, these things just don't work out and someone like Herrera isn't really good enough to tailor an entire system around getting his best qualities out.

I'm hoping he gets another shot, in a coherent/fluid United team. But I wouldn't be surprised if he's sold either. And I'm a big fan of Herrera.

2635~~~
Rooney at right back then i presume? Risky but it could work <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2636~~~
I see him staying for this season, but he needs to improve, otherwise he is a goner.

2637~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" src="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png"/><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" src="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png"/>

2638~~~
Haha yes perhaps I'm being optimistic with pogba. But Rooney and Herrera can rotate games if pogba comes. Otherwise Rooney schneiderlin Herrera isn't so bad

2639~~~
Fluid, quick, technically strong and working hard. Would be a lovely line up

2640~~~
There's a lot of faith in the idea that Schneiderlin won't be absolutely feckin' crap again this year...

I mean, I don't think he could be worse then last year, but still unconvinced he has what it takes to be a starter for us/

2641~~~
I would love to see that midfield next season but we all know that Rooney will be there one way or another.

2642~~~
Could Herrera be the Willian or Oscar type Mourinho usually likes to use for the central attacking midfielder spot? He certainly got the work rate for it. Mkhitaryan do as well. Could play Rashford out right.

2643~~~
This would be ideal, for so many reasons
a) No Rooney.
b) Herrera is the best B2b midfielder we have whose hair is not blonde.
c) Pogba can be brilliant in a 3 man midfield.

Of course that is if he is indeed joining us. In case he's not, then we're looking at a slightly different team, one with Rooney replacing Pogba and maybe Lass coming in for Schneiderlin.
