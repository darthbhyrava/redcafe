1~~~
Big moment for him to start with!

2~~~
Anyone else notice there is something very strange about the way he runs. 

Any idea why it is?

3~~~
Did well to create that Lingard chance, let's see how things go for him.

4~~~
Good and confident passing from him.

5~~~
Looks potentially world class based on his first 10 minutes.  That's how poor the rest of the side is

6~~~
That's just his style it seems.At least he's still effective with it.

Is he going to start on the weekend though?

7~~~
Looks a real talent.

8~~~
With our injuries we'll be seeing him on the weekend as well...

9~~~
Was very good tonight, better than Darmian at the point he came off.

10~~~
Only bright spark of the night.

11~~~
I really liked him; I hope he is given more chances and that the result does not overshadow his performance.

12~~~
Had one or 2 shaky moments but didn't look out of place.

And he is more of a CB than LB.

13~~~
Like Varela on his debut, thought he was OK. We've got no one else to play though so he's obviously going to start.

14~~~
I like his running style, he looks like t-rex with his pulled up hands.

15~~~
I thought he looked great. Hope we see more of him this season.

16~~~
Thought he looked decent when he came on, especially considering how he was suddenly thrown into such a big game. I'd be happy to see a bit more of him.

17~~~
Just start him and Varela.

18~~~
Top notch performance from him.. Didnt expect him to do so well

19~~~
Played well, a proper bright spark in a dark night.

20~~~
Confident passing and a burst of pace, good run out for him and now all our fullbacks are dead he will be getting starts.

21~~~
Very composed and never flustered, really enjoy his and Varela's performances.

22~~~
good with ball at his feet, not fazed at all, will be a good player, just need to gain some weight and will be a handy player straight away..

23~~~
Was a lot better than Darmian has been lately, we wont have much choice anyway but should start against Bournemouth.

24~~~
The only doubt i have about him is he is too one footed.

Has some other great qualities though.

25~~~
Played ok and looked confident going forward but did one big mistake when he played the Wolfsburg attacker onside, fortunately for him De Gea bailed him out.

26~~~
Given that he's only 18 years old, I was very impressed by him.

27~~~
Unfortunate to be put in the position he was but did well.

28~~~
Born in 1997, made me feel like a dinosaur. Very promising tonight, will be seeing him more with out injured defenders.

29~~~
Fortunate actually.A lot of other lads would dream to have such an opportunity to prove themselves.LVG certain will not have much fear now to start him on the weekend.

30~~~
That team against Bournemouth could be very interesting , potentially Rooney, Smalling, Jones, Herrera, Darmian, Schweinstegier, Schneiderlin out, on top on the Valencia, and Shaw.

Just pure madness atm.

31~~~
Surprised he was brought on but he played well

32~~~
I was very concerned when he came on ahead of Young but van Gaal got this one totally right. I'm proud and pleased for the lad, he's now got a chance of starting on Saturday and if he plays like he did tonight then I've got no concerns about him.

33~~~
Other than some positional mistakes, I thought he did quite well.

34~~~
He did well, I was kind of proud.

35~~~
Like this kid, have high hopes for him. Was a little worried the occasion would get to him but he looked composed and did really well.

36~~~
Holds his arms as if they're in a cast all the time

37~~~
Spot on.

38~~~
Are you his step-dad?

39~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No, but I was smilling like an idiot telling myself "hey, that's a homegrown player".

40~~~
Encouraging take a bow son

41~~~
All opposition wingers are going to get Tyrannosaurus REKT.

42~~~
Looked good in a high-pressure situation. I'm impressed.

43~~~
longest name ever in a united shirt and a good run out.

44~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Him and Varela are the ONLY positives I took from the game

45~~~
LVG threw him in the deep end, and he came up floating inside a rubber dingy. 

He actually looked more composed than darmian! It's weird in the sense that he seems like the rash 18 year old who makes the wrong choices and silly fouls. 

Maybe it was just the scenario of the game but I liked that a few times he bust his lungs to overlap Memphis quite a few times, but always seemed to be back in position again. Tough challenges await but in shaws absence he could be very handy.

46~~~
His crossing was better than I expected too, a couple looked dangerous.

47~~~
I loved those where he'd play it down the line and Memphis just did a little one touch lay off for CBJ to run onto. Just quick easy movement that creates loads of space and cuts through the opponents. We see it so little though, usually the fullback would just play it to Memphis/other winger and then just stand there so it was lovely to see him have the confidence to do that.

48~~~
How did he look in the reserves?

49~~~
CBJ is 4Reelz

50~~~
He's done fairly well in the 4 games he's played as a left back but hasn't been as good in the last 2 games when playing as a centre back

51~~~
Is he Tyler Blackett good or is he actually good?

52~~~
Well he's already adapted and performed better than Blackett ever did in the u21s. He's the best left sided defensive prospect we have coming through but personally I'd rate Tuanzebe, Williams and Fosu Mensah as better prospects as centre backs

53~~~
I missed most of the Liverpool game but he was our best CB against Norwich and S'land. All in all, he's taken to the u21s more smoothly than Tuanzebe has, but then he's a bit older. On the other hand, he hasn't had the luxury of focusing on one position.

54~~~
I think he has been better than Tuanzebe for the u21s too, been impressed with him most games. I find Tuanzebe has a tendency to be dragged out of position, younger obviously and new to the level so no real big concern. That's why I think CBJ looks more prepared for first team football, both still got a long way to go still so either way it is exciting to have such talents. Add in Williams and TFM and we're a bit spoilt for choice.

55~~~
Quicker than I thought. Haven't seen him since last year but I'm sure he's gained a yard. Excellent performance, impressive confidence.

56~~~
CBJ was pulled out of position a fair bit in the Liverpool game and was covered by Riley and Goss on quite a few occasions. I'm probably being harsh but I thought he could have done better on both goals against Norwich as well, he wasn't the only one to blame by any means with Tuanzebe caught up the field for the 1st and a poor pass from Weir and Johnstone stuck to his line for the 2nd but on both occasions CBJ reacted a bit slowly to the situation and sauntered towards the goalscorer rather than sprinting to get his body between the attacker and the goal. This type of thing is the main reason I prefer the others as centre backs, Borthwick Jackson just doesn't attack the ball aggressively enough as a centre back for my liking but he has been improving on it this season

57~~~
He's a good young player as you would expect. I think we've quite a few good young defenders. He's comfortable on the ball and he attacks well. There will be mistakes down the line but you have to give LVG credit. This is the other side of the coin whereby if you are a kid coming through, there's never a better time. The injurys have helped with that but Cameron won't let anyone down. Reid is another good young full back,very strong - so it's a compliment to Cameron that's he's come in and done well.

58~~~
We're certainly seeing one of them Norwich goals quite differently. The first one was a ball in behind a malpositioned Tuanzebe which BJ reacted to rather quickly, thus preventing Lafferty from getting much of an angle. Not quite sure what more you'd expect from him there. The second one is harder to analyze as MUTV was down during it and the replay lacked a bit of situational context, but it's obviously mainly on Weir, even if BJ perhaps could've tried to tackle rather than force wide and block and Axel's positioning looks a bit suspect again. But, ultimately, they're both new to this level and little mistakes due to a higher tempo and better quality opponents are to be expected. I just feel Tuanzebe's made a few more of them than BJ has so far, though it's interesting to hear BJ needing his ass covered against Liverpool as usually he's the one covering others.

59~~~
Hope he does well today.

60~~~
Will he actually start? Thought our back 4 would be like 

Varela-McNair-Carrick-Blind

61~~~
We need Carrick in midfield. Schmidfield and Herrera are out.

62~~~
Its the position of his arms when he jogs I find weird.

63~~~
Wonder if he'll go with 3 at the back. McNair-Carrick-Blind with Varela/Lingard and Young as wingbacks.

64~~~
No.CBJ is starting.

65~~~
Quite composed so far.

66~~~
Best name ever. Having a good game too.

67~~~
#Composure

68~~~
Like the look of this lad. Got that great thing kids have no fear in there play.

Hopefully some more runs forward in 2nd half.

69~~~
He's fecking shite.

70~~~
Its not fair putting a youngster into a team full of other youngsters. This is down to injuries.

71~~~
Poor kid is having an absolute nightmare today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Only just noticing people calling him shite - behave yourselves! He's a kid.

72~~~
Nor playing well at all but he's only 18 and he's been completely thrown in at the deep end.

73~~~
I thought he was our best defender. Not saying much given the other three were crap but still...

74~~~
Nightmare?He gave the ball away 2 times and made couple of defensive errors but not really dangerous.Not exactly a good performance but far from a nightmare unless I forgot something.

75~~~
Oh feck off you idiot I was defending the guy in spite of it. He struggled big time in the second half defensively.

76~~~
Uncalled for insult. Post reported.

77~~~
Never mind probably I have missed out something with the poor river.

78~~~
He's was poor. Really poor.

79~~~
And he always will be. Ship him out. Buy someone else.

Amiright?

80~~~
Just not ready, not his fault.

81~~~
- Enough with the sarscasm.
- I'm just pointing out he was terrible tonight
- You are not funny

82~~~
Hey I am funny.

83~~~
Very poor match for him. Embarrassed to watch in 2nd half.

84~~~
A good first half, but poor second half. Then again, our entire team was poor in the second half.

85~~~
Poor in posession, looked a bit lost today

86~~~
Didn't think he was that bad in all fairness. Kept it simple, gave the ball away a few times with some sloppy passes but positionally and defensively he was fine.

87~~~
At least he looks like a proper left back. He's 18 and local and surely has a long way to go, wouldn't be surprised if he played a role long term, but should ever have to play in a back four like that again, that should be guaranteed in january

88~~~
Thats the big thing, when a 18 year old is being throw in like this he is going to need some help. Instead he is playing alongside Varela and McNair who are also being thrown in and Memphis in front who is also having a hard time and doesn't always work the hardest. Its about the worst environment possible for a young defender to make a debut.

89~~~
yeah very challenging, that said i Didn't think he looked amazing, particularly with the ball, but looked at least like a left back who knew the position, a step up from blackett

90~~~
First half impressive. 2nd half a bit careless with his passing, and beaten too easily one time. Overall I thought he was ok.

91~~~
I think it was clear he was hesitant which massively affected his play. Again, if he was in alongside a full strength team I'd imagine he be a lot more settled and natural in the play. He was almost always a step behind, waiting for things to happen before reacting, looked scared to commit. Was selling his passes too with his body movement. Its clear he is nervous and wasn't great but I still don't think he was terrible. I don't think we can forget this is a kid who is just stepping up to the u21s let alone first team football. He needs time and he needs to make mistakes and he'll learn from it.

92~~~
on the flip side think varela, who is 4 years older, looks quite comfortable. Might take a good amount of bedding in, but having varela going forward would make me happy

93~~~
You can see why a 18 year old Shaw cost more than 25 million.

94~~~
Joyce needs to play him more at the left back role in the U21s.Should improve a lot when the season ends with the amount of U21s games in the second half.He still have a lot to learn at that level especially offensively and I do think he needs a loan (this has nothing to do with his performance tonight,just a thought about his development in general).

95~~~
I think he looks okay. A poor cross or two when he had the chance and didnt win the ball a lot but I think overall he wasnt one of our bigger issues.

96~~~
He looked... like an 18 year old playing football... 

Give him time. Thought he was crap in the second half, but has really impressed, albeit inconsistently.

97~~~
I won't blame him. He's not ready for the first team and it's not his fault he's playing there.

98~~~
He looked out of his depth today but wasn't alone, the whole back 4 looked lost without Smalling. I don't think CBJ was helped by having the erratic Memphis in front of him.

99~~~
I really agree with this. What we are doing is no way to break these players into the team. One or two of them at a time, with support from more experienced players, if we want to bring them up and see what they can do. Because of the injuries it's like a reserve team out there.

100~~~
Decent performance, but his lack of serious pace makes me doubt his credentials to become a top player. Could be a useful bak up to Shaw though.

101~~~
I thought he was awful in the second half today. But it's hard to put much blame on him, when he is being played out of necessity with our injury crisis, and squad depth. Not to mention he is very young. Too early to say whether he'll be good enough to become a PL player, let alone a backup player for us.

102~~~
He looked a bit slow, a number of times he was outpaced.

103~~~
Got a really laid back style about him. He was decent, though. Very composed on the ball. Almost too composed, at times.

104~~~
Exactly. Hes going to be inconsistent and struggle at times. I dont think we are helping him at all by putting him in this position. We have to accept this will happen if he plays without experience with him, or getting a run of games to improve upon.

105~~~
Come on guys lay off him, he wasn't that bad. He's only played a few games for us so far and he's done alright.

106~~~
not sure if he was rather bad or good, certainly worse second half than the first one as he gave the ball away too much but I like his running and work with ball at his feet, looks composed and unfazed by occasion at all, I want him to start next game, we dont have any better options anyway..

norwich home could be a great game for some young players to kick on, hopefully another former academy product robbie brady won't tear us appart..

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>CAMERON KEEN FOR MORE FIRST-TEAM ACTION</b></span>

<i>In Saturday's programme, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/programme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United Review</a>, <b>Cameron Borthwick-Jackson</b> looked back on a whirlwind few weeks as he discussed his senior Manchester United debut and being part of the first-team squad...</i>

<b>Did U21s football prepare you at all for the Premier League?</b>
I think it’s more about the physicality and the change in pace of the games. It’s a lot different to the U18s as you can sometimes get away with certain things, but if you make a mistake in the U21s, you get punished. I think playing against bigger and stronger players is a better test for you. It definitely helped coming up against senior players and testing yourself because it’s what you’re going to face in league football.

<b>In terms of your technique, you’re left-footed so often play on that flank when you’re not in the middle of the defence…</b>
I can operate on the right but I’m mainly used at centre-back or on the left-hand side. I enjoy either of the two positions as I’ve been rotated through them both. So I feel I’ve got a good understanding of both roles and it doesn’t really bother me where I play.

<b>Your debut was part a whirlwind weekend for you because you were instantly called up to the England U19s squad for the first time…</b>
I’d played in the U16s and U17s so I knew most of the lads in there and they are all good guys. It’s always an honour to represent your country and we played one game over in Holland, against Tim [Fosu-Mensah] and drew 2-2 before facing Japan at Manchester City’s training ground. So it was more good experience for me. 

<b>Another big step followed when you came on in Wolfsburg for your European debut…</b>
Again, it was a dream come true. Making my Champions League debut at 18! My family were all so proud and I got loads of text messages from everyone saying how proud they were of me. I wasn’t nervous. To be honest, I don’t think I had time to be nervous. Matteo [Darmian] got injured and I warmed up very quickly and was soon thrown on.

<b>You played your part in the build-up to Jesse’s disallowed goal – that was a key incident on a bad night for the Reds… </b>
Jesse whipped it in and the referee initially gave the goal but they’ve gone to the assistant referee and disallowed it. I was very disappointed with that but you’ve got to take positives, even from a negative. The Europa League is still a very good tournament. It’s not the Champions League but there are still some of the top teams from throughout Europe in it. A lot of sides have Champions League experience and hopefully we’ll do well in the competition because we will be aiming to win it. 

<b>You also got a taste of continental football in the UEFA Youth League this season… </b>
I played in three of the games and it is a different test. It is more about keeping the ball and breaking the opponents down. It is a lot more tactical and, although we did not qualify, I feel we did okay – especially in a couple of the ties.

<b>The manager praised your performance in the 2-1 defeat a<b>gainst Bournemouth</b>. Did you feel you’d played well in the game?</b>
Yeah, I thought I had a good game even if the result was very disappointing. He has worked with some of the biggest names in world football so it’s great to hear that kind of encouragement from him. It’s wonderful for me to be working under Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs as I can learn so much. I just think I could still do more to influence those sort of games. I know I’m still young but I must try to have more influence in being able to grab a match by the scruff of the neck. I want to drive the game as much as the other players do. I realise I’m young and still learning and that will come over time. I need to keep working hard in training so I can drive the games later on.

<b>You launched into two brave aerial challenges towards the end against the Cherries. Was it your way of showing you were determined to make your mark?</b>
I think so. It’s just one of those things. I don’t give up. I keep going until the end. I think that is a good way of showing it. You have to be on your game, even if things are not going well – you must try something else and never give up. I’ll always keep going until the final whistle. I think I’ve always had that determination but the coaches here helped nurture it. Warren [Joyce] works us hard every day in terms of getting fit and improving our running power. He drills it into you mentally to never give up. Paul [McGuinness] does as well but he focuses on developing how we are as players. Warren has helped me a lot to become a professional and push on. He’s developing me as a man so I can compete in senior football. Especially with the modern game being faster than before, you have to be fitter and stronger to cope with the demands. 

<b>It was a tough week – physically and mentally – but the focus can now purely be on the domestic front for this busy period. Will that help? </b>
I think we can push on. Obviously, with the squad we’ve got and the way we had been getting results until recently, we’ve been doing well. We just have to put the last few games behind us, look forward and push on and hopefully be title contenders. That is what Manchester United want to do. All the fans want us to do it and all the players want to win the league. That is the ambition.

<b>Players do not get any time for celebrations over Christmas – is it something you are used to?</b>
It’s just how it is, isn’t it? This is what I want to do and what comes along with it. It is a small sacrifice we have to make. I’ve had it over the years and can never complain because you are living the life you want to live.

<b>Finally, 2015 must have exceeded all your expectations. What are your aims for 2016?</b>
I suppose I would just like to become a regular in the first-team squad. That is what I’ve got to aim for, getting regular minutes in the Manchester United side. I need to make sure I’m in the manager’s thoughts and will keep working hard. I have to be ready for anything and, although I’m young and still learning, I think I can become a regular one day.

108~~~
Sounds like a sharp lad, I like how well he has performed in limited appearances with the 1st team already

109~~~
Great little cameo from him.

110~~~
He looks good this kid.

111~~~
Perfect cross he delivered, to bad he could not celebrate his first official competition assist.

112~~~
He was "ok" brilliant cross was the highlight. Was a good cameo for him at a stage in the game where chelsea were very happy with a point and didnt put him under any real pressure. all he had to do was play it safe.

113~~~
Horrible cross though. Left Rooney too much to do...

114~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

115~~~
I like him. Hope we don't buy another leftback.

116~~~
Nice cameo. Doesn't look fussed by big stage. Could have had a great assist.

117~~~
He looks pretty confident and that was a cracking cross he whipped in for Rooney.

118~~~
Very raw but he looks promising. Fantastic cross for Rooney.

119~~~
He looks quality.

120~~~
Good cameo. Hope to see him more this season.

121~~~
Has a good level of aggression about his game. Challenges and hustles but does it up-right without diving in. Willing to press and follow his man until the phase has been seen out too, much like Rojo.

122~~~
That cross he got in was a thing of beauty. 

But he tends to find himself badly positioned when we have the ball and he seems to be on a different wavelength to those around him.

123~~~
We'll all say nice things now, but as soon as he's sent out in a poor team selection or formation and the defence as a whole is exploited, he'll be torn apart on here. Just as McNair, Blackett, Varela and last week, CBJ himself have been.

124~~~
Looked alright today didn't he ! Some cross at the end, shame rooney couldn't stick it away with the head

125~~~
I love to watch him just because he's running so fecking weirdly it's inexplicably pleasing for me to watch him run. He's running like a t-rex or something.

It was a great cross too.

126~~~
Strong in the 3 standing tackles he had to make and a fantastic cross for what should have been the winner. Well done.

127~~~
He runs like an absolute bell-end, but definitely has something about him.

128~~~
Love academy players.  It's all I have left.

129~~~
I didn't notice many crosses when he was at the lower levels - but that cross put a lot of players to shame. We've seen such poor quality crossing from various players. It deserved to be the assist for a goal.

130~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> You wouldn't have his cross would you? 85 minute mark.

135~~~
It's weird to have a left back of his height and running style.Hope he's still on the thought of the next manager.

136~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

137~~~
Played well when he came on yesterday.  Very confident for his age and a bit of pace.  7/10.

138~~~
Delivered the best cross I've seen all season from any of our players.

Runs like a total weirdo, though. Nonetheless, a promising cameo today and doesn't look bad for an 18 year old.

139~~~
He's very good at picking out a pass. Interesting to see how he develops.

140~~~
He seem to be better than mcfail although that's hardly saying something

141~~~
Amazing cross and some nice incisive passes. He was very good and I am happy for him. I think he earned himself a start.

142~~~
Who's mcfail? I know of a McNair who's very promising but never heard of mcfail.

143~~~
It's devilish trying to be funny.

144~~~
McNair is dross.

CBJ looks good so far, is he a left back though? I don't know why but I had it in my head he was a CB. Perhaps I'm wrong.

145~~~
Think the best thing he did yesterday (cross aside) was man mark Zouma which would have (if he hadn't been moved to the right) stopped Martial being doubled up on as for the first 70 minutes Martial was basically by himself on the left.

146~~~
Nah, I think McNair has done well so far for United considering he's been dropped in at the deep end several times. Guys still only 20 aswell. 

And I know <a class="username" data-user="18823, @MDFC Manager" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/18823/">@MDFC Manager</a> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

147~~~
Can play both.

148~~~
Out of CBs who made 20+ appearances for us I can't think of any worse than McNair off top of my head.

149~~~
Currently? Out of Rojo, Smalling, Jones, Blind and himself he's probably the worst yeah, but he's also by far the youngest. 

If you mean of all time then that's a bit daft.

150~~~
Not that I can remember. From 97ish onwards I can't think of anyone who played quite a lot of games for us in defense but was as bad as him.

151~~~
Tekkers on that cross was fantastic.

152~~~
Extremely harsh on our Paddy but whatever you say.

153~~~
Ahh mourinho took 10 years to bring uo a youth player & still hardly got a game..

154~~~
Mcmare  is championship level at best

155~~~
David May was fairly average and a lot older than McNair...Why these oracles always come out criticising almost every youth player we ever play is beyond me. 

Even if he turns out not to be good enough it makes me happy to see young lads being given the chance. Except maybe Kieran Richardson, never could stand that lad for some reason.

156~~~
Nice to see he recovered from his mare at Bournemouth.

157~~~
McNair has potential to be a good player here. I rememeber him being good last season and a few saying he looks like a midfielder because of his quality on the ball. Got a good shot on him too, though that's not the be all and end all of a defender.

158~~~
forgive me, but whenever I see this guy, I think

"why the heck is this guy anywhere near the Manchester United team"

159~~~
That's a good quiz question, especially in my time back to the early 90s.

I'm guessing Blackett didn't play enough games then, as he'd be worse.
Silvestre had some real crap games at centre back before proving himself at left back.
Evans I never thought much of, but he did have a decent season or 2 when patrolled by a legendary partner.

Blanc, he was worse.
Got him insanely late, and just got run off the pitch.

160~~~
You are forgiven.

Silvestre was much better then McNair.

Evans did have an excellent couple of years before injury got him > better then McNair.

Blanc, although slow as an old bus time he got to United.. Still better then McNair.

And i'm not a McNair hater by any means.

162~~~
I wouldn't go as far as saying Evans had excellent years!

But I think only Blanc is a contender for worst v McNair.
Being run ragged by Bellamy, as if it was a ten v a 90 year old clouds my views on him

163~~~
I don't think that's entirely fair, Bellamy was a very good player on his day and capable of turning a lot of defenders inside out. Blanc was as slow as a battleship, though.

164~~~
blanc was miles ahead of McNair. Paddy got the run around by Josh King ffs. He's been took off at half time because he's hopeless, did he not only last 35/40ish mins once before we subbed him to put Carrick at CB.

How he was even brought into the first team is beyond me there was better in the youth side.

165~~~
McNair isn't that bad.Problem is he's a "project" in the sense that they tried to inject defensive capabilities to make him a defender.He isn't a natural defender so needs more time to learn that trade,if ever.That's why I suggested to send him out on loan as the best way to do it is to play week in,week out.His composure and ability on the ball is already there (not always show it when things get rough but it's normal for young players).

Obviously we have better,more natural defenders coming through the rank in the next 1-2 years (and even a few more beyond that) so if he's not gonna push himself he will be in a big trouble soon enough as the "youth" label alone wouldn't be enough to save him anymore, not to mention signings from outside.Again, the best way to push to the next level for him is to gain that vital experience somewhere.

166~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

167~~~
For such a young, inexperienced player he has an air of confidence about him. He didn't have a lot to do defensively but I thought he did ok supporting the attack. He also has that funny Raptor arms running style that Raheem Sterling has.

168~~~
Yep. Was impressed with him whatever little he had to do. Calm too.

169~~~
Did decently. I think he has the potential to be a very good crosser of the ball. When he does try to cross it,the way the ball curls with so much fizz and spin on it, is signs of a really good technique. But some poor decision making also, he tried to drill the ball along the ground from near the corner flag. Such sort of decision making should improve in the future. He slacked off a few times too, failing to track back and needed Blind's help to bail him out. But I like his confidence.

170~~~
Think he needs to be able to put some lift into his crosses though, almost always its across the ground. (if he was in the box and got to the byline that would be fine).

All in all, solid I thought, hard to judge his defensive composure in a game like this.

171~~~
I really like him. Sees a pass so naturally to get out of trouble, will be an interesting prospect when he fills out.

172~~~
Someone called him shit in the match thread <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

173~~~
Our best player today.

174~~~
When a team is not doing well, there is a tendency to write off everything. The players are shit, manager a dinosaur, tactics horrible, board clueless and so on ... . I understand emotions run high but sometimes you really think people are incapable of seeing through the mess.

175~~~
Match threads bring out the worst in an already deluded bunch, so I wouldn't pay any attention to it. He was very good and mature in his play I thought, interesting prospect for the future.

176~~~
He is calm in possession. These are the sort of games we should be giving him playing time. Rather than throwing him in vs Wolfsburg and Bournemouth away

177~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he's quite limited in going forward? Can't dribble and really slow to go on the overlap -- sure, he can cross, but he needs quite a bit of time and space to whip a ball in. He was calm on the ball, though, I will give you that. Hardly tested defensively today. He's doing alright when you consider his age, but apart from maturity he just seems somewhat average in most aspects of his game.

178~~~
He needs to practice whipping the ball in from the left. Very Valencia like today. Performance wise, he did alright. But he wasn't really tested.

179~~~
He's better than Zeki Fryers

180~~~
He can dribble a bit, just that he hasn't shown much of it on the first team games yet possibly due to the higher cost of losing the ball.Generally quite solid defensively as well.

He's quite rusty with his crosses yesterday.Looks like the pressure has gone to his mind a bit.Still calm otherwise though.

181~~~
Would be an unbelievable prospect if he had great pace. I like him.

182~~~
He played one low cross that was delightful but no one attacked it. Chico would have been skating with his ass on the grass trying to bundle those in.

183~~~
He seemed to defend really well. I know it was a League 1 side but still impressive for someone playing his 4th game(?)

184~~~
His defensive game seems to be fine enough for a LB.As a CB (at U21s level) he's still lacking a bit of aggressiveness when closing down a player so a good striker or a pacey player can take advantage of that but again he's very lack of experience even at U21s level.

185~~~
I like this kid. Very composed and confident.

186~~~
Cameron T-Rex Jackson

187~~~
His running style is definitely the most interesting thing about the game.

188~~~
Very good performance by the youngster. Extremely impressed.

189~~~
I quite like him, has a lot of confidence for someone who's so new to big games.

190~~~
Did well today, only 18?

191~~~
Another good performance. Darmian went over to the right and also looked twice the player.

Can he get a start?

192~~~
Been very impressed with him this season. He's the McNair of 2015/16.

193~~~
I like Darmian more at right back than Young and I like Borthwick-Jackson more at full back than Young.

Composed youngster, good short passer. I think he's being used wisely, obviously thrown into the match today but it didn't phase him like it did Lingard.

194~~~
Yeah.Will turn 19 next month.

His natural calmness and presence will help him a lot in claiming a place in the squad.

195~~~
Very good performance from him, little going forward, fine, but he does run a bloody lot and defended well. Easy to lose your shit in such match.

196~~~
he was really good when he came on.

197~~~
He's pretty solid isn't he? Very calm and composed for an 18 year old playing away to to Liverpool.

198~~~
Just got on the forum to say the same thing. In traffic with the ball at his feet he stayed calm and created space for himself. Very calm for such a big game and I'm pleased to see him get minutes. A positive performance.

199~~~
He's a very cool customer, this is about as tough of a game to come on in as you can get for a United player and he stepped up comfortably. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

200~~~
He's been pretty good every time he's come on. Hopefully he keeps it up.

201~~~
Take a bow, Cameron. Really steadied it at the back for us, and positive in attack as well.

202~~~
I would rate him above Darmian as it stands right now.  Always happy to see youth players coming through with talent.

203~~~
He runs like he's 8 but played left back much better than Darmian did. The defense looked much better with him at left back and Darmian on the right.
Hope we stick with him and move Young to the wings.

204~~~
He should keep his place.

205~~~
I think he was superb given the circumstances.

206~~~
Survived and managed to excel. That's two things too many to require from the young and learning and nobody would blame him much if would simply fail today.

Watching him is exciting and for a few moments turned attention away from the worrying style.

207~~~
If he can keep it up then although you probably can't see him getting past Luke Shaw it would still be good to have a backup who can play both Centre Back and Left Back.

208~~~
Did very well indeed, that little run where he ran in behind the Liverpool defence could havee resulted in a goal. Quite happy to see him start tbh.

209~~~
Luke Shaw - 20
CBJ - 18

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

210~~~
That LB position is definitely sorted out for the next 10-12 years.

211~~~
If Young is out, then hopefully CBJ gets his chance at left-back. He's handled himself very well so far for United and I'd like to see him given an opportunity to nail down that position (until Shaw gets back of course).

212~~~
Looks a smart little player but it's very early days. Credit to him though, must've been nervous coming on.

213~~~
He is really good for his age.

214~~~
Was he naturally a LB for the youth set-up? He looks very assured there as though it were his regular position.

215~~~
Me too. He seems to regularly be playing better than Darmian there and Darmian seems more comfortable at right back. If Young's injury is anything serious then we may get our wish.

216~~~
I actually trust him there, unlike Blackett who used to scare the shit out of me.

217~~~
The new Evra! All jokes aside, fair play for him to experience his first rival game win against Liverpool at the age of 18.

218~~~
He's got balls of steel. Which also explains why he runs like he does.

219~~~
He's good, composed on the ball and a decent crosser. He also runs a lot, but with Darmian on the other side, we are too slow. Neither player is slow, but they just lack that little bit of acceleration.

220~~~
The ball was in the air so much it would be easy to come on and lose your shit but he did well. I think he's playing like he did in the youth team and he will improve if he works hard. He's got good ability.

221~~~
I would really like to see him play from the start with Darmian at RB. We looked far better defensively after he came on

222~~~
Looks a good prospect.

223~~~
good performance. Impressive. Intelligent full back performance. Still needs improvement but good base indeed

224~~~
Delighted with his performance. Him and Shaw could cover as at LB for years to come.

225~~~
Great to see him doing well out there. Nothing quite like watching a youngster come through and deliver against Liverpool!

226~~~
That's not really an issue if they are intelligent with their runs as CBJ was today. Neville and Irwin were hardly quick but both very intelligent players and the timing of their runs was fantastic.

Of all the players LVH has brought through CBK is the one who looks a proper prospect. Pity he's not a RB.

227~~~
Im sorry.  All you guys rate him pay a bit of respect to van gaal please.  He does so much for these young players.

228~~~
Rather we just play him now as LB and get him minutes rather than shifting our defence all over the place. He will make mistakes, he will also improve from them and get some good experience.

I do think he needs to work on getting some lift on his crosses though.

229~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Eh?  He came on as a direct replacement due to Young's injury.

230~~~
LVG should get credit here for reducing the size of our squad so that when injuries happen, players like CBJ come into the team. 

Happy for him, good performance!

231~~~
From his first appearance you could the class and quality he has. This kid has a bright future.

232~~~
Love how calm he seems all the time.

233~~~
Love him.

234~~~
True it's better for us to have him as the weak link than to have both fullback positions as potential disasters. Start him and play Darmian on the right so that we can at least have Young on the left, Martial up top and Rooney playing off Martial. Maybe, just maybe, we would look more balanced playing like that.

235~~~
Think he's showing more than Darmian, classy composed looking player.

236~~~
I get relaxed when he has the ball at his feet - a kind of "Blackett-in-reverse" reaction so to speak!

237~~~
He wont get it from the fans but the players who benefit will love him for it. I bet in 10 years time the likes of Lingard, Martial etc will have a very different outlook on this season than most fans.

238~~~
He's our fifth choice leftback. I don't think LvG deserves much credit for playing him when he's got no other option.

239~~~
Looking solid when he came on, it's abundantly clear Darmian is also so much more comfortable at right back, we looked much better defensively.

The only thing I would say is he's very safe in possession, I'd like to see him be a big more adventurous with his passing and perhaps to run with the ball a little bit more.

240~~~
That should change now hopefully.

241~~~
Both Darmian and to a lesser agree BJ were passed with ease simply by running past them. Sometimes intelligent runs just isn't enough. I don't buy into that "use your intelligence" over athleticism argument as that only work if the other player is stupid as feck and runs in a straight line. I doubt many PL players are that stupid. Darmian struggles one on one against quick agile players. BJ looks slightly better in that respect. 

Also, football has changed since Neville and Irwin played. Look at Evra and Shaw for the importance of quick feet and mobility for a fullback. Both don't have to be, but at least one should be.

242~~~
Evra is not a good example at all. He almost always beat his man going forward because the timing of his runs were brilliant which is what CBJ did today when he went past the Liverpool defender. Shaw is an exception as is someone like Bellerin. Would be great to have that kind of player but they are rare as feck. You don't need to be express at full back to be able to effect the game going forward.

243~~~
Thought I was the only one who noticed that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

244~~~
What? Evra timed his runs very well, but he was faster than Shaw is and used his pace countless times both to get in behind the defense and to stop fast attackers. He often dribbled past and ran past defenders from a stand still - not typical traits of a fullback at all, and his pace certainly helped him run past defenders on well timed runs. Zabaleta is similar to what you describe. The only player Evra consistently struggled with on pace would be Lennon, but he's the fastest accelerating player I've seen.

245~~~
Not really. Evra's main strength and reason he got in behind so many times was his timing of runs and running onto passes. The number of times he actually dribbled past players using his pace was miniscule in comparison.

246~~~
I say keep playing him at leftback over Darmian who looks really dodgy on that side of the field. 

Absolute kudos to the boy for not looking out of place.

247~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ET9wVHuj7uA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> 

Just watch parts of that clip, especially the first few minutes and tell me he did not use his pace. Your memory is very, very wrong. Looking at that video though, the thing I miss the most about him was his ability to initiate attacks from a defending position. He would intercept a pass or make a tackle, run past a player or two and make a great pass to an attacking player. We miss that. 

He was bloody fast though - one of the fastest in the league in his prime.

248~~~
Paddy Evra was a monster. He was also extremely rapid

249~~~
Nothing wrong with my memory. 90% of the first few minutes is him running on to passes and making runs which no one tracks. He's obviously rapid but that wasn't why he was so good. CBJ isn't as quick but looks like he knows when to make runs and hopefully he can learn as he plays more.

This I agree with. Shaw has this in bundles though.

250~~~
Shaw has what Evra had in bringing the ball out of defense, but he isn't quite as quick nor does he have the dribbling skills that Evra had. Keep watching and I think you'll see that Evra's pace helped him out massively both in attack and in defense. Outpaced Walcott for the ball (impressive that), I remember him outpacing Robben over and over, and ran past fullbacks like Bosingwa (before he turned shite) quite often. In defense, Evra relied a little too much on his pace, often allowing wingers a yard or two to force them down the line and then pin them down - often worked, but failed to do so when he lost a yard. 

Agree that he was a master at making runs in behind the defense, but he didn't mind simply running past them either.

251~~~
At his prime, he was the complete fullback. Fast as hell, both over distance and short bursts. His leap was beyond ridiculous. What set him apart was his ball playing skills and his ability to facilitate an attack.

252~~~
Spot on.

He was a shite crosser though, that can't be ignored.

253~~~
Any clips of his running style? 
Can't say i've noticed anything odd with him

254~~~
I think he did good job today.

255~~~
Man I miss Evra. I'd almost completely forgotten that brief period where he magically turned into Tim Cahill in the opposition box. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

256~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un-S9zUViOU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

257~~~
How can you forget? That was basically the only time I ever remember us scoring from corners

258~~~
I like this kid's crossing. Better than all our attackers.

259~~~
I like this kid, I'd keep him in the team with Darmain or Young at right-back.

260~~~
Very young but looks pretty mature and extremely composed. He will still be prone to an odd mistake here and there and could cost us points, however, so far he looks like a great little player in making. May it long continue.

261~~~
Definitely deserves a shout. Came on on very difficult circumstances and did very well for his age and experience. Will probably have hit and miss performances but so far he has been surprisingly solid.

262~~~
What I like about him is that he is not scared and loves to whip in those crosses with his left. Proper guidance and training will really get that crosses perfected. I would like LVG to give him a decent run of games on the left and trust him. He can turn out to be something special for the future. Hope he doesn't become another Recce James. Where is him by the way? Used to like him

263~~~
Impressed me yesterday. Great attitude, not frightened to get stuck in and does well up and down the line. Looks mature beyond his years. A promising start to his senior career.

264~~~
only negative, and it's a positive negative for United, is when Shaw returns his opportunities will be limited.  Shaw's not exactly a dinosaur is he at 21.  Yes, we need cover for every position, something we're obviously lacking right now, specially at the back and up front, but having a good young left back on the bench when you've got Shaw in front of you in the pecking order is something that will eventually get to him.

but like a said, it's a positive negative for United having a good left back coming through and providing competition for Shaw when he's fit

265~~~
We should have two quality players for each position on the field. 

I'd much rather have Shaw and a proper left back to rotate with, rather than have Blind or Rojo fill out on that side and upset the balance of the rest of the team.

266~~~
A few people has stated now that Evra was faster than Shaw. I'm not so sure about that, Shaw's pace is ridiculous.

267~~~
Yes and yes.

268~~~
Thought he did well against Liverpool, But I'll reserve judgment until this time next year. I can remember people rating McNair and Blackett last season and we can see how they have turned out.

269~~~
Who rated Blackett?

270~~~
To be fair, I remember one lad on here had a hard on for Blackett.

271~~~
I still rate McNair.

272~~~
Me too. And nobody ever rated Blackett.

273~~~
Well that's not true. Far too many in here did: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett-2014-15-performances.396104/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett-2014-15-performances.396104/</a>

274~~~
Blackett to be completely fair to him was good in our first games last season till the Leicester game. At least he took to the back 3 better than anyone else.

275~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Jan/Chris-Smalling-highlights-Cameron-Borthwick-Jackson-performance-for-Manchester-United-at-Liverpool.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Smalling:</a> BORTHWICK-JACKSON CAN HANDLE ANY GAME</b></span>

Smalling paid tribute to his fledgling team-mate and suggested he has a successful Reds career ahead of him. “I think he showed he is ready for a stage like this,” Chris explained. “He has been drip fed quite a few games this season and he has done very well. To be able to stand up here and perform like he did shows he is ready for any game because if you can perform here then you can perform anywhere in the league.”

Asked if he looks after Borthwick-Jackson on the pitch, offering guidance in different scenarios and situations, Smalling agreed but said Cameron can also look after himself: “I like to talk to the defence no matter who is playing. Maybe it’s a case of spurring him on when he does something good just to keep that going but on the whole he looks after himself because he is a very level-headed guy.”

276~~~
Evra was definitely faster than Shaw. Shaw is rapid too but I don't think we've seen enough to suggest he's faster than Evra. Shaw shows his speed in bursts, Evra used his speed more frequently throughout an entire game and at top speed i'd say Evra at his peak had Shaw beat. You've either forgot or maybe you didn't see enough of Evra especially in his early seasons

277~~~
I actually reckon Shaw's top speed is probably faster than Evra's was, but Evra had faster acceleration, was faster when dribbling with the ball, and was better at running into space so was able to show his pace more often than Shaw.

278~~~
BJ was primarily a CB in his younger days, I'm sure he'll get plenty of game time whoever is in front of him at LB if he keeps improving. Could see him even getting a game as a DM too at some point perhaps a la Gibbs.

279~~~
watching that video makes me think that Evra would probably be the most skilful attacking threat in our team right now (as misleading as you tube clips may be)

280~~~
Let's just say they're both fast as feck and for the record I love Evra, for me better than Irwin. So I won't have any didn't see enough of Evra bullshit, I've probably seen 95 % of his United matches.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

281~~~
Is it just me or does he look like one of our best crossers?  Not saying much but..

282~~~
I agree. Running style or build can make people look faster than they actually are.

283~~~
I personally liked Blackett but I think spending too much time in the gym affects his agility and ruined his progression as a player.

284~~~
After Martial and when he was fit, Shaw was too, really. Nobody else in the side can drive powerfully with pace and cause defenders to commit like these mentioned can.

285~~~
I definitely concur. I like his composure on the ball too.

286~~~
nice performance. for an 18 year old he is so cool and confident.

287~~~
His crosses remind me of a pre number 7 Valencia. He drills them in dangerous areas - it's a shame no one gets to the end of them.

288~~~
He looks like he's high all the time.

289~~~
He certainly tries to get a good pace and whip on them. Sometimes he will blast the ball into row z but that's the price we should be willing to pay to get a great ball in once in a while.

290~~~
He definitely whips them in.  He also seems to be our only fullback that actually gets to the byline when he overlaps.

291~~~
Will soon be coached out of him.

292~~~
Considering his age and inexperience, I have been impressed by Borthwick-Jackson. I do not think he looks significantly worse at left back than anyone besides Shaw. Rojo plays the role better, but Borthwick-Jackson has more pace and has time to mature when it comes to game management/judgement calls. I actually feel we'd be better served giving him a run at left back, so that Darmian can play on his natural foot.

293~~~
You are a fun person to be around im sure

294~~~
This. I did notice him playing on Sunday. Meaning that he was doing his job

295~~~
Very well <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

296~~~
Its still early days however unlike mcfail this guy seem to have some talent in him

297~~~
Ashley Young and Luke Shaw became worse crossers of the ball since joining us. Valencia too.

298~~~
Valencia's problems date back to much earlier than Van Gal.

Ashley young has arguably become better under Van Gal than under Fergie or Moyes.

299~~~
Its not a Van Gaal issue. Its a United issue.. totally agree that under LVG there has been improvement but compared to his Villa days where he was the best crosser in the league.. been a drop in quality.

300~~~
I rate Bo-Jack. Good attitude and no-nonsense approach. Not really put a foot wrong and you feel he's making the most of his chance.

His arms and quirky little run reminds me of T-Rex.

301~~~
I seem to recall him being good in his first 6 months, then it dropped a lot.

302~~~
He's looked very capable when stepping in and obviously has good pace and ability. The drawback for me is he seems a little reactive and not aggressive enough, watching things happen in front of him rather than snuffing danger out early. I think that's probably inexperience and the pace of the PL being a factor. I'd expect him to improve with more game time in the first team.

303~~~
I really highly doubt its either.

I think its just a perception issue. You remember the failures more when they play for United because they annoy you, whereas you only remember their successes for other teams.

304~~~
Yeah.

Against Liverpool:



Against Chelsea (hit a bit too hard but still one of the better crosses I've seen from our fullbacks since Shaw got injured):

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/wwbg" width="560"></iframe>

305~~~
That one against Chelsea was a beaut

306~~~
Not really. Anyone would tell you just how good a crosser he once was.. he was in everyones PL Fantasy team and would rack up assist points like crazy. Playing for a bigger team there is added pressure, granted but the rest of his game hasn't been that bad.. it was crossing which completely deserted him for a while. He seems decent at it again now but nowhere near what it once was.

307~~~
He's so slow when it comes to passing and he always needs a couple of touches before making a decision. He got some talent, but nowhere near ready to be playing for the first team.

308~~~
Could we actually call him Cameron Jackson? So we could cut it to CJ?

309~~~
Having a player in front of him to pass to would help.

310~~~
Not a fan of BJ? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

311~~~
Depends if I'm the one on the receiving end!
<span style="color: #ffffff">which is never</span>

312~~~
The only positive that can be taken from today's mess is CBJ's performance, I liked those inside channel passes he played 2 or 3 times, he seems a smart player.

313~~~
He's been a bright spark in this shitshow of a team. Kinda like McNair last season actually, but he seems more composed.

314~~~
Well said!
Again!

315~~~
Miles better than McNair. Looks a great talent.

316~~~
Yeah spot on.

317~~~
Yeah, going to expand on this before people slate him for not doing anything going forward. He was playing as a wingback today, not a full back. The main issue with a 3-5-2 is you need specialists in every position...quick aggressive CB's good on the ball, very complete centre forwards and wingbacks that can hold down a whole wing by themselves, attacking and defensively. Only a few players around can actually play well as a wingback....Lichsteiner, Alex Sandro, Alves, Marcelo, Alaba etc. Good stuff from Jackson again today, when he adjusts to the speed of 1st team football passing wise, and gains a few pounds, he can be an excellent option for us.

318~~~
Always belong in a higher bracket than the likes of McNair in the youth team/U21s tbh so not much of a surprise.

He needs to be trained/developed more on his attacking prowess for sure, has always been regarded as a more defensive type of fullback.

319~~~
I thought he was relatively poor today; of course so was nearly the whole team. And the whole 3 (5) at the back doesn't appear to help anyone.

320~~~
Its just such a stupid decision. You have an 18 year old who has hardly played at u21 level let alone first team level so what do you do? Give him the whole left side of the pitch to play by himself. Who the feck could think that would be a good idea? CBJ did alright but you're never going to get anything productive trying to set up like that.

321~~~
I think his attacking play looks quite good even now tbh. Seems an intelligent player and know when to pass and when to cross. A real fecking pity he's not a RB.

I wonder if we could try and see if he can play CB.

322~~~
Yeah I always rate his fundamental footballing skills but to be a more attacking-minded full back you need more than that, still loads of time for him to improve on.He's equally adept at CB but he seems lack of bit of aggressiveness when closing player down while playing that role in the lower levels.Of course we never know how he will fade at PL level.

323~~~
Think we should consider it. Shaw is gonna be impossible to replace when he comes back.

Anyway, I'm excited about him.

324~~~
He seem to be adapting quite well to PL football better than most of the higher rated youngsters coming through. 
I think playing without the pressure of trying to prove a point is allowed for these assured performances.

325~~~
I think his growth will kinda be stunted by the lack of quality around him tbh.

Then he will probably get railed on this forum for not progressing (or regressing) despite it not being fully his fault as were not helping him fulfill his potential, lol.

326~~~
Nah, he'll be fine with the players around him. If he struggles, then it won't be down to that. Plenty of players impress in far lesser teams.

327~~~
Yeah, big fish small pond, but then they have to make a step up, and unless the players they are with can help them improve, its a a stunted growth. That can translate to most walks of life, including and especially football.

328~~~
What he impresses me with his ability to pick out a pass. In situations where Darmian just smacks it long aimlessly, he finds the angle and plays an accurate pass.

329~~~

330~~~
He has impressed me so far. He actually looks better attacking wise than Shaw looked last season when he started playing for us.

But no doubt after one bad performance lots of people here will say he is shite and nowhere near good enough and that some here like him only because he is from our academy.

331~~~
Can you post the contents of the article if it isn't behind a paywall, won't let AdBlocked browsers view the article.

332~~~
He has done good job so far. He has been properly tested by the opponents ( unlike Blacket who looked class until had to some defending)?

333~~~
I don't think he is actually very good. He's neither exceptionally athletic nor skilled.

334~~~

335~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I suppose 500% does sound a bit better than 8 grand.

336~~~
I second that. He's been reliable, which is good, to an extent. But Luke Shaw is far and away, head and shoulders above him. Shaw is only two years older. When Shaw was 18, he was playing a full season at Southampton.

Attacking wise, he's shown to cross the ball but he's be allowed to go up the pitch unmarked because team can exploit space behind him and he's really not that fast. His gangly arms and legs are deceiving his actual pace, which isn't all that good.

He's played only 258 minutes in the Premier League, with two starts - all United losses. He's been reliable for the most part, but his sample size and experience is way too small. He'll play because United have nobody else at the moment.

337~~~
400%
They cant even get that right.

338~~~
Didn't even need a bad performence. Started doing it after encouraging starts now.

339~~~
99% of 18 year olds in the world may as well stop playing then because they are no where near Luke Shaw at 18. Its as ridiculous a comment as the one in the Wilson thread about Ronaldo scoring almost a goal a game at the same age so Wilson has no future because he can't even score a goal a game in the Championship.

340~~~
A previous poster compared CBJ's attacking performances from 5 appearances that it was better than Shaw's attacking performances from his early days last year, I think that's where my point was going. Apologize for the lack of clarity/perspective.

It's not a ridiculous comment saying that Luke Shaw is better than CBJ. CBJ has time on his side, but he'll have to do a lot more to claim LB from Shaw...unless Shaw becomes a leftsided midfielder and makes a Bale type transition. If CBJ progresses and it's apparent that United have to have him in the side because he's that good, then that's a good situation to be in.

As long as CBJ is reliable and doesn't have too many glaring mistakes, then good for him and the club. But playing on the safe side of things will only get him so far. If we want enterprising stuff, he's got to show it with the time he'll be given. Defending, pass, support, repeat. It's his for the taking right now and we hope he takes it because everybody wants him to succeed. If he does good, the team should obviously benefit and do good as well.

341~~~
Or the fact that he might not come back from the injury the same player.

342~~~
While that is very possible, just like CBJ not being the world-beater we all want to see, that's a grim outlook on Shaw. Physically he'll cope because he's young, he was in great shape prior to getting hurt and it was thankfully a clean break. I'm more interested in his mental side and how he reacts to getting stuck in for a tackle.

But again, if CBJ takes his chance then whoever is manager will have to decide if one of them plays or if both can play together in the same side.

343~~~
Having a bone heal 100% isn't an exact science. He might end up with some pain to follow him and that might affect him mentally. It's tough to say, people are very mentally different. Jones is always injured but that doesn't seem to faze him at all.

344~~~
I'm often one to suggest we give youth players the benefit of the doubt. He has played a few performances now, and while we can't say he's been dreadful, he hasn't shown anything that promising either. People hate blackett here but you can't fault him for his size and athleticism. CBJ doesn't have either, from these games we've seen. I'm entitled to hold that opinion <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

345~~~
He's 18 and is maybe an inch shorter than Blackett, he has yet to fill out, that is obvious, he is also not slow. For someone who is a natural centre back he is about where you'd want him. He also has a good eye for a pass and is extremely calm on the ball, arguably at 18, two things infinitely more important than his "size and athleticism"

346~~~
Thats where we disagree, because at senior level I have seen nothing that indicates he is calm on the ball or has a good eye for a pass.

347~~~
I'd second that. He look mediocre to me. Terrible crosser of the ball too.

348~~~
Thought he was great. Did he give the ball away once? Mature.

349~~~
He was great. As was Varela on the other side.

350~~~
Impressing me more and more. Would love to see him get chances even when all our fullbacks are fit again.

351~~~
I like him.

352~~~
His passing is really good and he's very defensively solid. Looks a very good prospect.

353~~~
Except for the tache. That is terrible.

354~~~
For one so young i feel totally relaxed with him in the side. Very composed player who seems positionally sound and very tidy and calm on the ball. These will be great minutes for his development

355~~~
I concur with your opinions.

356~~~
he looks very mature with his performances so far, great on the ball and that extra bit of height is quite a plus for a wide player, will be interesting to see if he becomes CB or LB, as it wont take long and Luke is back and we might be in the market for a CB again.. lets see, but hes on of the upsides of recent weeks for me, really like to see promising lads from the academy doing well, wasnt actually expecting particularly him to be given chance but fair paly to him he took his chances well so far..

357~~~
I really like the cut of his jib, shame he's not a RB as when Shaw comes back it's going to be harder for him to get games.

358~~~
This kid so far is not bad at all. Surprises me how calm he seems. I hope he continues to improve.

Love his nickname 'BJ'<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What you lot like on the Caf?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

359~~~
I prefer BoJack <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

It's not sensible to have BJ AND Fellatio as nicknames for our players.

360~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

361~~~
Even for a teenager Bo Jack is a weird looking fella.

362~~~
Plus Cunnilingard of course.

363~~~
You guys are killing me<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

364~~~
LOL. BoJack. It goes with LoJack. 

Very competent performance today and I liked how he pushed forward. Supported the attack very well, although Derby seemed to get the most joy out of his wing (although it really didn't happen that much).

365~~~
This one is actually pretty good. Well done.

366~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cn3tC8Colvh9AYmNNy4N6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAwO2g9Mjgw/http://l.yimg.com/cd/diminuendo/1.0/original/711b93b2fa389a7af38c350ff4c5a179703890ce.gif" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cn3tC8Colvh9AYmNNy4N6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAwO2g9Mjgw/http://l.yimg.com/cd/diminuendo/1.0/original/711b93b2fa389a7af38c350ff4c5a179703890ce.gif"/>

Edit: who can say which scene this is taken from...

367~~~
Don't know if it's the haircut, but he looks like a young Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of Bell Air.

He was very good tonight. I've been very impressed with him in Shaws absence, and wouldn't be against having him as our number two left back next season assuming Shaw returns ok.

368~~~
Playing a left back in the LB position <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I think Isaid it before, hes going to make mistakes (its going to be inevitable that it will happen). What matters is how he bounces back from them.

369~~~
His close control is really good and he tries positive passes (when they're on) as well. Impressed with his positioning as well which was said to be his biggest issue. He's already twice the player Blackett is for me even though, admittedly, I've never understood what was Tyler doing anywhere near to the first eleven.

370~~~
He's doing great so far. 

He'll be tested more by other teams obviously, but he has the raw materials to make a decent left back.

371~~~
Looked like a genuine top draw talent.

372~~~
Fortunately, bouncing seems to be one of his biggest strengths.

373~~~
Looks unphased playing for the first team, was impressed with his ability on the ball.

374~~~
Great cross from him

375~~~
Beautiful delivery.

376~~~
This boys got one hell of a cross on him.

377~~~
Perfect ball. Lovely whip on it.

378~~~
He really does, and it's not just a one off either.

379~~~
Bend it like Borthwick

380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Great pass!

381~~~
We could have a talent on our hands.

He only joined the first team because of our annual defensive injury crisis but he has not look out of place at all. Him and Shaw could be a great left back pairing for years to come.

382~~~
He might move into centre back and become the type of player lvg craves. A big strong left footed CB who can pass out of defense.

383~~~
I like what he's doing out there. Plays with the composure of a player far more experienced at this level.

384~~~
He's a CB of origine, even though he's played LB often enough. For the Dutch fans, he reminds me of Riedewald, the more physical type of blind. Very good on the ball, very smart, sound tactically but also got height, speed and good body balance. Hope he gets a chance there when Shaw returns.

385~~~
The bug is absolute quality.

386~~~
LB pretty sorted for a good decade or more.

387~~~
Looks grand, could have one of those 15 year 400+ appearances type players on our hands here.

388~~~
His best game for us so far. He has that emotionless style like Martial, his facial expression change even less than Van Gaal's. He has shown good temperament since stepping up.

389~~~
He's actually brilliant. I hope he's 2nd choice behind Shaw.

390~~~
I like his style, got great one touch passing ability.

391~~~
We should have him as backup to Shaw, very composed player.

392~~~
He is a better attacker than shaw tbf.

393~~~
Well played kid - his form should mean Darmian can stay at RB where he's twice the player and Blind can keep boss passing from centre defines...

Just need no more injuries, get a winning run going and see what a difference some confidence can make to our consistency - 10 points to the top -  it's on peeps <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

394~~~
Very impressive, with him and Shaw we're pretty much sorted for LB position.

395~~~
Very classy performer. Beautiful cross for Lingaard, made in the academy.

396~~~
Might be a bit early for this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Having said that he has hardly put a foot wrong so far. He looks comfortable too, his technique is good enough I think

397~~~
It's like watching a Carrick who can play LB. Such a calming presence.

398~~~
He keeps impressing, he's quick, composed and uses the ball really well, I wonder how we'll work things when Shaw returns as he genuinely looks too good to just be riding the bench most of the time.

399~~~
Funny man

400~~~
I love the presence he has. Magnet for the ball and his sheer size and athleticism makes him such a mountain to climb down that side for any winger.

401~~~
Iv not been impressed by shaw's attacking or crossing at all.  Have you?  I'm talking since his move to united.

402~~~
Yeah he already looks better than Rojo as a backup  leftback.

Doesn't  he play CB also?

403~~~
No.

404~~~
We have the LB situation along with Shaw wrapped up for years if this carries on. He thinks when he's on the ball like someone far more experienced than him. Doesn't rush it.

405~~~
Fair do's if you dont.  Yet to see shaw hit those crosses in.  Ive seen CBJ do it like 5 times a match &  all hit perfectly.

406~~~
Shaw was pretty good start of this season btw, usually picked out his man. But I really do like CBJ

407~~~
Been saying he'll make it here for a while, didn't expect him to step up this quickly though. 

I think he'll end up at centreback though.

408~~~
Shaw is more of a threat as a LB and we miss him greatly. Don't get me wrong, am very impressed with Jack.

409~~~
What makes you say that?  Sounds like a replacement for rojo?

410~~~
Plays like he played in the youth sides. Very composed performance. Think he's got a big chance but let's take it game by game. Chelsea will be another test if he plays

411~~~
I haven't seen Shaw being particularly good at crossing, but that doesn't mean he's not been a threat. He drives up the pitch with absurd pace and strength, that causes teams problems

412~~~
Seems to be getting better every week. Playing far, far beyond his years at the moment.

413~~~
Still runs like a T-Rex, though.

414~~~
Evra would be proud of that cross to Lingard.

415~~~
For everything LvG has done wrong - he deserves credit for what he has done with CBJ and Lingard

416~~~
Just from watching him playing for the unders. He reads the game well from CB, confident on the ball and carries it out well. I think he'll follow a similar route to Evans, it's easier to be blooded closer to the touch line and he needs to fill out before he will get his chance there.

417~~~
Evra probably managed 3 crosses of that quality in his whole time here. So yes, he definitely would.

418~~~
Lol beat me to it!!

419~~~
Evra was a terrible crosser.

420~~~
Not by standards of the current team.

421~~~
Just turned 19 today too.

422~~~
His start to his career has been as convincing as a young Gary Neville.  He's composed, fit and committed and already possesses many of the technical requirements to be a top full back.

He will have some average performances over the next months, but I'm already convinced he is enough quality to be a rotated squad member; who knows how far he can go beyond that.  One of LVGs successful bets.

423~~~
Even better for us if he can!

424~~~
He's found the step up to first team football much easier than I expected he would, put in some delightful balls into the box, will be a terrific back up to Shaw, strangely we could be sorted there for a number of years.

425~~~
More important than anything else can we please agree his nickname is BoJack, not CBJ or BJ?

Thank you.

426~~~
Is CB his normal position in the youth teams?

I'm so proud he has come through our Academy and even more so that he is a Mancunian.

427~~~
I thought hes been Left back all the time? 
Anyway regardless, LB playing at LB <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Think I said this after the last game :P

It makes a difference and it was a lovely cross for the goal. Good to see him getting a run, hopefully when Young is fit we dont put him back in defence and change it around.

428~~~
Our acadamy is shit though?

429~~~
Would be a dream to be honest.  Shaw is obviously the long term left back presuming he rehabilitates well.  Jackson has shown great maturity on the ball and execution of passing.  May need to bulk up which I assume will come with time.  Early days of course but at the age he's at he could really be moulded into a good ball playing centre half.

430~~~
Fantastic today. I'd be more than happy with him and Shaw being our left back options next season.

431~~~
I <i>like</i> that

432~~~
Still looks like 15!<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Bless

433~~~
I really like him.

Also, that cross was bloody wonderful.

434~~~
Good kid, should only get better. am I the only one who wishes he would shorten his name to Jackson?

435~~~
You probably are, yeah.

436~~~
Yeah... everyone knows it should be CamBo

437~~~
Credit to LVG for using him over the past few weeks and not loaning an emergency LB/RB for cover.

438~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://d55ohm6038bug.cloudfront.net/June2014-Bojack/images/bojack_contact.png" src="http://d55ohm6038bug.cloudfront.net/June2014-Bojack/images/bojack_contact.png"/>

439~~~
See him as a future LCB, him and Shaw over on that side of our defence could be great.

His running style makes me laugh every time though.

440~~~
His maturity is simply unbelievable, can't believe what I am seeing from him right now, he looks a PL full back having only seen him in the academy where he never stood out as a cut above, he made one slight mistake tonight with a dodgy defensive header, but he recognised that recovered and cleared it, there is no doubt his main strength is his mentality, great assist on his birthday too, really delighted for him.

441~~~
I had a friend in secondary school that used to run like Borthwick-Jackson. Feel like internally fist-pumping at those who poked fun whenever CBJ runs.

442~~~
Also considering how much pressure the team is under and for him to come in and keep his head for the most part is really impressive for a 19 year old. Hope he pushes on.

443~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

444~~~
I somehow think he's too stupid to be nervous. I don't think he realizes that 75.000 people watching you are supposed to make you shit yourself.

He's showing tremendous composure and the boy can attack as well.

445~~~
He's always been ice cold. Obviously before now he'd never experienced anything on this scale, but context has noticeably never phased him.

446~~~
Shaw doesn't cross much, he almost always prefers to keep running then cut the ball back, and he's done that with a remarkably high success rate for us so far. He'd have had a hatful of assists early in the season if Rooney hadn't been playing like such a donkey.

CBJ's doing great, but let's not get carried away, he's not near Shaw's level yet.

447~~~
He's growing by the game in terms of confidence, which is always nice to see in a player that young. One thing you can't fault with LvG is bringing players like him, McNair, Lingard and Varela to the fore and sticking with them when we suffered injuries.

448~~~
Seems so assured on the ball for such a young player. The ball he delivered for Lingard's goal was superb. Great game.

449~~~
Real surprise package of the season. I assume most people hadn't even heard of him until he appeared on the bench for the first time.

450~~~
Very good game from him. Good too in defence apart from one dodgy clearance when he headed the ball up rather than away - but even then he cleared it straight after.

Peach of a pass to Lingard too.

451~~~
MOTM for me. Great to see a youngster doing well.

452~~~
Sounds excruciatingly painful, and not at all proportionate to the crime.

453~~~
Going from strength to strength. Hopefully none of this LVG bullshit about can't expect consistency from young players. This guy just seems to have two gears, rock solid and very good. Walters could have been an absolute handful but, CBJ had none of it. Also, he put in a second very inviting ball, just no one attacked the near post to put the finish that it deserved.

454~~~
Can't wait for his partners in crime Tuanzebe,Williams,etc,... to eventually get there.

455~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Alright Welbz, hows Arsenal mate?

456~~~
Yes because only LVG has ever said that <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

457~~~
No he is not but, he has used it as a way to explain why they are not played once the older players are fit even though those players have not been playing well. For instance, I thought Varela had a really good game agains Derby and possibly deserved to keep his place because Darmian before his injury had not been playing that well. I can see if Rojo comes back LVG opting for him using him or even perhaps move Blind out there if Jones is paired with Smalling.

CBJ has shown that he is good enough, which means he is old enough, same as Martial, who when he first joined LVG had said won't play every game because he had already in his mind that he wont' be able to perform well enough week in and week out due to his age.

Obviously CBJ still may have a bad moment or even a bad game or two but, he definitely should keep his place over everyone else except maybe Shaw when all are fit based on his performances and not dropped because of his age and the possibility of inconsistent play.

458~~~
Clearly got the composure to play at the top level, he doesn't even look fazed by the crowd in the slightest. And he never seems to give the ball away either, he's a fantastically calm passer of the ball.

459~~~
The same redcafe will also call him 'not good enough' after a couple of bad games. McNair for instance was also good at CB in most games yet people act as if he is the worst CB on earth.

460~~~
Another good performance by him. He's calm and composed for such a young lad!

461~~~
What's Ruud got to do with this?

462~~~
I'm surprised how mature he plays. His crosses are dangerous too. May it continue. Chelsea will be a proper test as Willian is quite good.

463~~~
Noticed that, a great thing to have. Valencia's like that as well, he only gives the ball away when he's blasting it into the left back's leg, which happens a lot to be fair.

And I must say I like the thought of CBJ potentially being able to play as CB when Lord Luke's back.

464~~~
I literally came into this thread to ask about this. Has he played CB before? Once Shaw is back, I still want to see this guy get chances.

465~~~
He's doing great. No the quickest though is he?

466~~~
Someone said he's played there for the U21 and is originally a CB.

467~~~
Shaw is fast. Makes shitty crosses.
CBJ is not that fast. Makes more than decent crosses.

Let's evaluate who is better once Shaw is back.

468~~~
His pace's fine. I think he's just appears a bit slow because he's <i>jogging</i> like an absolute spastic with arms flying everywhere. When he's in full flow he looks OK.

<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

469~~~
I think CBJ has looked the best of defensive academy graduates playing for the first team in the LVG era but his crossing had been appalling until last night.

470~~~
Right, so I've finished my evaluation already: Shaw's better. He was sensational before he got injured, Bale-esque pace and power down the wing.

471~~~
I disagree. I wrote this a few weeks ago:

<i>He certainly tries to get a good pace and whip on them. Sometimes he will blast the ball into row z but that's the price we should be willing to pay to get a great ball in once in a while.</i>

Yesterday we reaped the reward for paying just that price.

472~~~
All players try to put good crosses in, only the end result counts.

473~~~
All decent players are capable of putting a decent lofted cross in, must likely to be cleared rather easily by the defenders. To put a <b><i>GREAT </i></b>cross in there's an element of risk involved, you might end up looking stupid if you miss. Hence many players choose to just "lob in the there" to avoid embarrasment.

474~~~
excellent cross. has been a while since we scored from a cross from the far side.

475~~~
Ok. You pick Shaw please.

476~~~
People are forgetting that Shaw was the Martial of defence before he got injured, even Liverpool fans thought he was good. I love an academy product as much as the next person but Shaw is a much better player than BJ.

477~~~
I thought he was good again, It's nice to see him taking his chances. Not sure long term what his ceiling is, But certainly a very good squad player thus far.

478~~~
I was shocked to hear he might be more of a centre half because he looks so natural at full back.

Always need to be careful not to get carried away and he doesn't seem to have been tested much defensively so far, but as ever it's such a joy to see a local lad impressing.

479~~~
Could his emergence allow us to push Shaw further forward?

480~~~
Really exciting performance. Great to see. Our left flank is looking pretty strong with him, Shaw, Martial.

481~~~
I don't think so, you have to remember Shaw is probably the best young full back in Europe and whether you love him or hate him we have Memphis too who is considered (or was considered) another elite talent on that side, saying that CBJ had definitely impressed me, Varela too. For all the shit the papers give our academy we're smashing the U21s and consistently providing first teamers who have stepped up from the youth teams when we really needed them. I think CBJ is a very good talent, just a shame Shaw is so good otherwise he could probably be a starting left back for us.

482~~~
I'm really impressed with this kid. Every time he plays he does better and better. He also seems to be a great crosser.

483~~~
Really pleased for him and pleased with him. He's had to deal with quite enormous pressure, being thrown in in the must win CL game and he's really grabbed his chance. Makes such a difference having players in their correct positions, a left back who can actually cross and has pace, going forward.

484~~~
I know that most here had a go at LvG for having short squad of first team players but in cases like this,there is a positive side of his way too.

485~~~
Keep saying this but of all the young players LVG has given a debut too, he's the one that stands out.

As soon as Shaw comes back, we should try and see how he does at CB. He looks far too good just to be a back to Shaw.

486~~~
He's skinnier than skeletor, he'd get ruined as a CB

487~~~
Agree, it must be about two months ago he whipped one in that was even pacier and more curved, but it wasn't finished so didn't get the attention it deserved. Can't remember which match it was. It's not just that those crosses are fast and curved, it's also that he only needs half a yard and doesn't need to pass his defender to get one in. A few mishit ones that end up in the stands is not a heavy price to pay.

488~~~
Agreed. But I thought the same about McNair too. McNair looked very solid when he first got a run in the side, but this season he looks half the player he was, which is a shame, as I think there's still a lot of talent there. I hope the same doesn't happen to BoJack.

489~~~
He does seem rather strong though. He's 19 yo and one day, if he fills out his frame he could be a unit.

490~~~
Bullied Walters with ease, too.

491~~~
Re McNair, he had this ridiculous backwards diving header sort of thingy preventing a goal in one of his first games for us, I believe many formed their opinion om him just by that. I never really bought into the hype. Away at Southampton in december last season he was such a nervous wreck he had to be hooked in the first half. He didn't really play much after that, I think.

492~~~
And Walters is strong player using his physique a lot. I'm not worried about CBJ.

493~~~
Yeah, I don't think McNair ever showed the general level of intelligence and refined composure as Borthwick-Jackson has. It's still really early days though, so a dip in form at some point will be inevitable and completely acceptable, particularly considering he will pretty much be our only LB option for a while.

494~~~
TBF he played at RB? As a CB I think he still has something to offer

495~~~
Just compare him to Blackett, who seemed completely lost during his short stint as a starter.

496~~~
McNair is a CM by trade if i recall correctly. Wasnt there a big shock when LVG played him at cb over one of our other academy lads who was actually a natural cb?
I would love to see McNair get a shout in the center of the park sometime (in a meaningless cup game or sometime during the summer) to see if he can handle it there.

497~~~
I like this kid. Good defensively. Good crosser. Looks like he is about to fall every time he runs but he has done well so far. Coming Sunday against Willian will be a big test.

498~~~
Good player IMO. Provides width on the left when Martial is cutting in.

Nice to see an academy lad do well

499~~~
You're thinking of Thorpe. But no, Paddy was already playing mostly as a CB at the time. He came to us as a CM but was converted in the youth teams, although he continued to play at CDM often and was even compared to Carrick if I remember correctly. I think by the time he got promoted he was seen mostly as a CB though.
The shock was mostly due to the fact that Thorpe was a few years older, reserves captain and was generally considered to be the next in the pecking order to be promoted.

500~~~
Think it was against Chelsea when Rooney should have scored

501~~~
His passing and crossing consistently impress me. Hopefully he gets more athletic with time, but there's definitely aspects of his game that stand out pretty naturally.

502~~~
I have been a critic of his, and did say not long ago that I didn't think he had the necessary requirements to make it here, but yesterday he was nearly perfect.

503~~~
got it all apart from the hair. he needs a haircut

504~~~
Even forgetting the crossing, I thought he was fantastic defensively yesterday. I loved the way he handled the long balls to one of the best players in the world in Walters and the gangly Crouch. He was never enticed into trying to jump in and win the aerial ball. He was smart enough to know he wasn't going to beat them in the air so he just applied a bit of pressure and then backed off and jockeyed them. He let them have the ball a few times but he wasn't giving them the chance to attack space or do anything effective with it. Very smart play. Was very impressed with his step up to u21s and he has continued that straight into the first team in a remarkably short space of time.

505~~~
He played cb for England u16s and u19s and for most of his first year with United u18s. His 2nd year u18's he played lb and this season with the u21s he's played half of his games cb and half lb. He has also played some games as a left winger and played as a dm in the Milk Cup last year. He has actually played more senior games now than u21 games

506~~~
He cannot walk around with that hair anymore. Has to go. SAF wouldn't stand for it.

507~~~
He cannot walk around with those arms too, I loved Denver but that's pushing it too far.

508~~~
Best crosser in the squad, right now.

The pace, curl and topspin he gets on them is incredible. Fires them in from really tight positions, too. That's a rare quality. Even peak Valencia used to need a yard of space.

509~~~
The way things are going he'll be changing his wheels soon...

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7161664.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Cameron-Borthwick-Jackson-arrives-for-training-in-a-Vauxhall-Corsa.jpg" src="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7161664.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Cameron-Borthwick-Jackson-arrives-for-training-in-a-Vauxhall-Corsa.jpg"/> 

Yep you're right....it's a Corsa <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

510~~~
He should go car shopping with memphis.

511~~~
If he keeps playing well might have a slight chance of making the Euros (depending on Luke Shaw) as 1 posistion isn't nailed down it is at left back.

512~~~
He looks like a nice prospect, hopefully he can continue this form till we are missing Luke.

513~~~
I know that almost everyone will disagree with that, but he should be our left back even when Shaw comes back. Shaw is our Alaba, we can find him an other place in the team like LCB or Matuidi's role for PSG.

514~~~
That's the point of the policy and it means players like Borthwick-Jackson will work that much harder and learn that much more early in the vital part of their career than had they not broken into the team until later so it helps his development and as a club you know what a player is made of when he enters the first team and shows you so you can plan transfers.

After losing Paul Pogba fans should have more respect for the policy of using youth over experienced stop gaps.

The dilemma we have here is that Shaw is really young so the only way we can make it work is if one of them can play another position.

515~~~
What makes you think Shaw will be a better LCB than CBJ?

516~~~
....has football intelligence. Will be a very good player down the road and probably make it here.

Vaguely reminiscent of Beaker from the Muppet Show.

517~~~
CBJ is a better crosser while Shaw is more physical and seems to be better at marking and covering. But Shaw is more experienced so in the future it could be the other way around.

518~~~
Wouldn't say that just yet, I've also been impressed with Shaws delivery, especially earlier this season. However I do see your point.
I also think Shaw displayed excellent ability at running at players and being direct earlier this season too.

CBJ is looking like an excellent prospect though, we are blessed.

519~~~
Why would you play someone who's actually played at CB a lot of times at LB and someone who's always played as a LB at CB? That makes no sense.

Shaw is miles better at running with the ball which is incredibly useful both defensively and offensively. Not even sure BJ is the better crosser. Shaw doesn't cross a whole lot but when he does they're usually fantastic.

520~~~
Because a players position at youth level isn't necessarily his position at professional level? Otherwise Makelele would be a winger.

And it's only a suggestion.

521~~~
It makes hell of a lot more sense playing players in positions they have actual experience in

522~~~
What really is fantastic with him is his full name:

<b>Cameron M'Bouba M'Briwa Abou Terrence Fuongo Borthwick-Jackson</b>

523~~~
And who said that you can't try both? To find the best combination you need to try.

524~~~
I was actually wanting to see Shaw as the LCB when we were playing 3 at the back last year. Keepin' it real Cruyff having your full backs playing that position.

525~~~
LCB for CBJ sounds like a plan when Shaw's back. He might be a bit skinny at the minute but he looks like he can handle himself okay. Get him in the gym a bit and he could be a real shout in that position. He's 6'0' so not the tallest for CB but not unreasonable as there have been plenty of good CB's that height over the years...

526~~~
He's been a hidden gem for us. Love the guy.

527~~~
Please can we stop the "he's too short for a CB" posts before they start?

528~~~
he truly is, woder if he can add a bit of explosiveness to his game, he's very composed player but a bit of fight wouldnt do him a harm, saying this he showed he can use his body in terms of tussling with opponents

529~~~
Not sure that's his real name. Must be a Wiki edit, surely, mocking fact he has long name anyway?

530~~~
That's not what I was suggesting btw. I was arguing for him. Steve Bruce was a quality 6ft CB and Henning Berg did pretty well for us at the same height. Puyol was only 5'10'' and was a monster.... Cannavaro at 5'9'' won the Ballon D'or. I'll always insist that size doesn't matter though...especially to the wife!

531~~~
Terrence Fuongo<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

532~~~
I think Cameron is fine where he is. It's amazing that he's nearly played 10 games this season. LVG deserves a lot of credit for giving certain lads a chance.

533~~~
Hope Mike the Chef made the little lad a special birthday cake<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

534~~~
He is playing because Shaw, Rojo, Blind, Young and Darmian cant play there.

Giving Van Gaal credit for playing CBJ is being very generous.

535~~~
Ferguson would play Blind as LB and Carrick as CB, just to piss CBJ off and let him leave to Juventus.

Give credit where its due, van Gaal's record with giving chances to young defenders is amazing. Last year he took Blackett and McNair out of nowhere, now it's Cameron. Varela played couple of games as well. He trusts in youth.

536~~~
He made the conscious effort to trim the squad to give youth players a chance.

I know he's not popular, but credit where credits due with BoJack.

537~~~
Carrick was injured. SO that makes CBJ 7th choice then.

538~~~
Carrick was just an example, during injury crisis Ferguson would often play his experienced midfielders as CB - Keane, Carrick, Fletcher, so his younger centre backs (Smalling, Jones, Brown etc.) would be moved sideways to play let's say right back.
So looking at our squad now, Ferguson would definitely put Carrick/Bastian/Fellaini as CB, so Blind could play LB. Ferguson wasn't very keen on giving young Rafael a chance, when we all knew he was already our best right back, let alone playing some unproven, no-name player like CBJ out of nowhere.

Van Gaal is not afraid of using youngsters when needed, he even gave Tyler Blackett 12 games and Paddy McNair 18 games last season when we didn't have defenders fit for a while, while Ferguson was too afraid to play Paul Pogba when we had no midfield for like 5 years and gave him just 7 games in total. The difference is huge and credit to LVG.

539~~~
Also, Ferguson would win the league.

540~~~
Can't believe people are debating Bojack vs Shaw at LB.. Shaw was one of the best LBs in Europe before his injury <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

541~~~
He will make a fantastic back up to Shaw, saves us having to buy another player which is great - he's proved he can be trusted if Shaw ever needs a rest or is in poor form also.

542~~~
Coming up against a good right winger, I'd trust Shaw 100%. CBJ has some way to go in that regard

543~~~
The same Rafael. Who played 28 games for us in his first season with us?

544~~~
You had a point but you destroyed it by mentioning Rafael. Fergie absolutely loved him!

545~~~
He could easily have played Carrick/Jones/McNair at CB, and Blind at LB, give the man credit.

546~~~
They were all injured. all of them.
CBJ might have earned his spot now, but he wasnt given a chance after our first and second choice got injured. 
It took Shaw, Rojo, Young to get injured and even then Blind and Darmian were the preferred choice. Jones, McNair, Carrick have all been injured for large parts. Well.. McNair not for that long, but he was out for a good few weeks after rupturing his liver... which happened about the time CBJ and Tuanzebe were called up. 

If I remember correctly, LVG even called Tuanzebe up to train with the squad before CBJ. 

Van Gaal has given kids a chance. McNair and Blackett last season showed that.. But I really dont think he can get any credit for playing CBJ.
He had very little choice. There were plenty of injuries and whatever few players we had left were playing a lot at that time.
He pretty much had to look at the reserves for players and pick a left back from there. 

CBJ got his chance and has made the most of it.

547~~~
He's been played at times with McNair or Jones on the bench so he has been given a chance over both of them. I don't really know what you are expecting here. Did you want him to play over Rojo or Darmian or something? Hes only played 5 u21 matches, of course he wasn't going to play over fit first team players. Joyce tells van Gaal who should go up to first team training and Tuanzebe is rated higher within the club than CBJ, I don't really know what that has to do with anything anyway. He shouldn't get credit for playing CBJ because he called up a different youth player too? He had to look at the reserves because of injuries because that is how he sets up his teams. He could have easily signed a fullback in January or another CB last summer to push Blind wide but he'd rather keep a small squad so when there are injuries he gives the youth a chance.

I don't understand the criticism of they were only played because of injuries. Of course, that is how the vast majority of young players get their chance. No manager is just going to randomly play an 18 year old with little u21 experience over a fit Luke Shaw or Rojo other than in a possible meaningless match.

548~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nice post!

549~~~
There is no criticism. none at all.
I just dont get the praise. Its not like he spotted talent and promoted a little know kid to the first team.
It was pretty much his last resort. 
Again. no criticism. But this isnt a case of a manager spotting potential and giving youth a chance.

550~~~
Its not a last resort if it is the plan from the start. He also had transfer windows to change it and give himself other options so it isn't a last resort imo. He's had options and he has decided to go with CBJ, how is that not spotting potential and giving it a chance? CBJ is a little known kid too.

551~~~
That's a bit like when people thought that Lindegaard was actually challenging De Gea and deserved to start ahead of him.

552~~~
He is doing brilliant but Shaw is definite first choice if he can get over his injury.

553~~~
Can't praise this kid enough. Every delivery looks dangerous, hell of a left foot he's got.

554~~~
I like this kid. Dare I say his crosses are almost like a left footed Beckham? 

Not saying he's as good, but the way he whips it round the defender without needing to take it past first.

555~~~
He's fecking awesome.

556~~~
Saying it again -  he is a better attacker than shaw.

557~~~
A real find. His delivery, whether it's passing or crossing, is quality.

558~~~
No, hes not but hes pretty fecking good.

559~~~
Doing very well and provides a real threat with his crossing

560~~~
Mourinho would dispose of him so quickly. He has been class and his crosses is almost as good as beckham.

561~~~
I think he's looks better on it. Has more about him technically.

562~~~
I hope Van Gaal does not decide to drop him for not watching his line, which resulted in the goal. I might have jinxed him because I just added him to my fantasy team before the goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

563~~~
Undone all good work with this one mistake.

564~~~
It wasn't really terrible mistake, he wasn't that far behind, Blind stepping out of the defence acting like a midfielder was far worse than him.

565~~~
Genuine talent. Nothing fazes him. Could have stop Costa's goal but can't fault him. The world is there for him to take.

566~~~
His crosses are a delight. Unexpected upside to Shaw's injury.

567~~~
Costly mistake for their goal otherwise played well. His final ball seems better than any of the other full-backs at the club.

568~~~
Yep, Blind stepped up and fell over.

569~~~
I feel sorry that his mistake cost us the game because up to then he was solid.

It doesn't help that Memphis is casually losing possession and not tracking back. 

My gut said we'd ship a goal as soon as I saw Memphis' pass.

This is what happens when you are relying on young players.

570~~~
I think he's absolutely class for someone who's barely turned nineteen. A good defender, and a very decent crosser to boot!

As for the goal, for me it's not his fault. Blind simply can't push up like that in that situation.

571~~~
Tough lesson. He'll benefit from it in the future. I hope.

572~~~
Notices today that he's awful under the high ball. Couple of times he didn't trust himself and let it bounce as well. 

Still, minor criticisms.

573~~~
What happens to him when Shaw's fit? Can he play in the middle?

574~~~
Yeah, he's naturally supposed to be a CB though was filling in at LB in U18s due to lack of options there and Williams and Tuanzebe/Mensah at CB. 

For the U21s this season he's mostly played CB though and Did well.

Having said that he'll probably end up on the bench.

575~~~
Just like I said I'm not blaming any of the defense for the goal, the blame lies in not releasing the pressure. CBJ was very good against today, he's so calm and technically good on the ball and his delivery is excellent.

I honestly think it's more likely Shaw would be converted to CB if that was even on the cards.

576~~~
That cnut wouldnt dispose him because CBJ wouldnt have a chance to even sniff around Mourinho first team.

577~~~
Only a small amount of blame for the goal in my eyes. Blind pushed out unnecessarily. CBJ had very little time to react, and he wasn't that far behind the defensive line.

578~~~
his deliveries are alarmingly good, probably the best we have actually for a dangerous cross.

579~~~
What a crosser of the ball. I have never a recent United player cross a ball with so much pace and so much swerve. And he's got some neat skills too. More than has what it takes to be at this level and play for United for a long time.

His inexperience did show however. That dummy by Willian and the Costa goal.

580~~~
Hopefully he has the sort of character to take mistakes on the chin and learn from them. Nothing he's done on the pitch suggests that won't be the case but it's always a possibility with young players.

581~~~
Behave

582~~~
I don't think Blind pushed up to try and catch Costa offside, he decided to close down Terry for some reason. Not exactly a horrific mistake in and of itself from CBJ, we've seen far worse from far more experience defenders.

583~~~
Has been a very good player since he came into the side. Love to see what he is like in 2-3 years.

584~~~
He always seem to have that extra bit of calmness and composure but it's still crazy how he took the step up so gracefully.

585~~~
He's got a bit of work to do defensively but a solid attacking performance from him.

One of the best crossers I've seen wearing the shirt in a very long time.

586~~~
Looking like a spark in this season of doom and gloom.

587~~~
So quick with his feet. Does not just hoof it even under pressure. Have to say I was apprehensive when he first came on against Bournemouth but he has been very good for us. Also cannot really blame him for the goal. Blind stepping up stupidly and falling over actually cost us the three points.

588~~~
Could save us a few quid in the transfer market. Looks like a worthy deputy for Shaw.

589~~~
BoJack might just be the real deal. I like this kid. Ok he made a mistake but that's normal at his age. Overall he was good. Please keep improving lad.

590~~~
I think it's a bit like comparing Evra and Cole. Evra was far better at driving forward, getting into positions and just owning the entire side of the field, but Cole had a better final ball so at the end of the day they generally had similar attacking stats.

Likewise, Shaw is a much better all-round attacking player than CBJ. At least basing it on his form this season before the injury (last season he was much quieter in that regard). But CBJ's final ball has been very impressive so far, probably better than Shaw's.

591~~~
We must have the youngest left side in the world football?CBJ,Shaw,Memphis and Martial.

592~~~
Its like our attackers have never seen him play football before. You know hes going to whip it in, yet nobody wants to get on the end of the crosses or a midfielder doesnt want to gamble to get a goal.

So glad hes been given a chance to play and is taking it.

593~~~
And there was one back post cross he struggled to get off the ground and deal with under little pressure. Minor, he'll learn.
Looked good so far

594~~~
He's had some serious tests so far and come through them well, I'll forgive him that mistake for goal today, was unlucky his recovery tackle didn't save goal. At least he didn't play costa on and watch play unfold. Did as much as possible to rescue situation. But back to tests, Wolfsburg, Anfield and now today.

595~~~
You have to wonder if it's possible for both Shaw and CBJ to play in the same side from the left.

596~~~
If we play 352.....

CBJ may end up partnering Smalling in central defence though. I think left back is just a way to ease him in.

597~~~
it all stemmed from Memphis giving the ball away cheaply about 15 seconds earlier

598~~~
CBJ partnering with Smalling would have some rough patches, but CBJ is able to support the attack and his crosses have been excellent. You want to take what he offers to the team and use it, so going to CB kind of limits that. The fact that he's a left footed defender gave him the chance to play because of all the injuries. Darmian is a RB obviously, but Darmian had to play at LB while Young was on the right.

599~~~
Really impressed with the progress he has made so far. I was sceptical after the Bournemouth game where he struggled, but since he has come back into the team he has gone from strength to strength. He's intelligent, quick, composed on the ball and he crosses the ball better than the vast majority of our attackers. Other parrts of his game like his physicality and heading ability will come with experience and when he grows up.

I'm not too annoyed that he made a slight error of judgement, that could have been any players on the pitch, but we were under a lot of pressure and it's understandable that a young player who might be a little tired could lose his concentration.

He probably won't be first choice left back when Shaw comes back to fitness but he could grow into being a good centre back.

600~~~
He haad a good game despite struggling a lot against Willian. Has an assurance about him as if he doesn't feel out of place, which wasn't there when he first came into the side and isn't there with the other young defenders we've tried. Also has recently just in general been miles better than anyone else we've tried at LB since Shaw got injured.

He wasn't at fault for the goal at all unless you think we were playing an offside trap despite our whole team being camped inside their own penalty area...in what world would this not be a terrible idea from the get go? The goal doesn't happen if Blind has half a clue how to play as a centreback, and the way we were just spanking the ball up the pitch like cowards meant it wasn't really a surprise either.

Really harsh to blame it on the one player who would have an excuse for lacking the experience/compsure in that situation, when the whole bloody team was at it.

601~~~
Anyone got the video of the goal? I could be wrong but how the hell some people are blaming him for it is bizarre. Looked to me like he nearly bailed Blind out with a great tackle that nearly stopped Costa.

602~~~
Well, imo he felt asleep and when other 3 defenders pushed forward he stayed and play Costa and Ivanovic onside. 
Genuine question why do you think its Blinds fault? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

603~~~
This. The kid was in the right place till Blind broke ranks ruining the whole shape and made everyone look out of position. That gamble by Blind should have only been made if his partners was next to him and not in a situation where your FBs end up being the last defenders.
Anyway this about the kid and his ability to put in proper performances, when we were thinking he would be overrun by now.

604~~~
So happy for this find. More youth please.

605~~~
Possibly the best crosser of the ball in the league. 

He's got a left foot wand

606~~~
Just came to post this, should not all football players be able to cross like this?. They play so much football non stop, and they all jut hoof the ball into nearest player or aimlessly into the box. Anyway CBJ is making excellent crosses into the box, playing very mature for his age, and good defender too

607~~~
Put on ball after ball in the danger area. 

Love the guy.

608~~~
Both fullbacks were fantastic today but CBJ's crosses are phenomenal.

609~~~
Him and Martial work well together. Even if Martial isn't having the best of games, his movement and presence opens up space for the full back to overlap. CBJ exploited it really well.

610~~~
Excellent crossing today, shows real potential.  Couple of dubious decisions - complacency on the ball when best to hoof it, and hoofing it when under little pressure, but overall a very good performance for a very inexperienced kid.

611~~~
Has two assists now. What I really like is not only can he deliver a good ball but he don't fanny about. The strikers know that if he's running onto it, it will be whipped in

612~~~
Now we have the problem of when Shaw comes back obviously he gets fit and gets back in the team, what of CBJ, could we try him on the right?

Or could we try a Bale with Shaw and move him to the wing? And the CBJ can take LB?

613~~~
Ideally, I want this "problem" for each position. Keep every player on their toes with hungry quality players so they can truly fight for the position. That way rotation wouldn't cause our whole team to collapse.

614~~~
It was both.. Borthwick-Jacko should've held the line..he was too busy watching Ivanovic(?) but hes inexperienced so it happens. Blind gambled and tried to intercept the pass, missed, then slipped trying to recover leaving Costa free.

615~~~
He has, but he has to bear in mind that while whipping in a super dangerous cross along the edge of the six yard box would be great at most clubs and result in bags of goals, at United, he had to remember that Rooney and Martial will likely be behind the penalty spot. Hernandez would've thrived on his deliveries if he could stay onside.

616~~~
Some of the attacks on Bo-Jack here boggle the mind.  Blind took an unnecessary risk and we paid the price.

617~~~
Classy

618~~~
Why not the other way round? Because Shaw is by far the superior defender.

619~~~
I ll wait for Shaw's recovery and see the post-injury performances before I would say that. No one should have a position for granted.

620~~~
He's done well since he has come into the team. Fair play to him. Not sure how good he will het but he's made a promising start.

621~~~
The world's at his feet. His defensive game will improve for the workout Willian gave him and he has a cool head.

622~~~
Definitely, and considering I hadn't even heard a thing about him before this season, is all the more impressive. Hard to believe he's only 19 and has been thrown in at the deep end. It was sink or swim for him really and right now he's swimming along quite nicely indeed.

623~~~
And he's only just turned that!

624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this place is brilliant. 

Young lad has a couple of decent games and all of a sudden he's better than Shaw (who was also crap and a waste of money at one point last season but has since then become the best lb in the world).

625~~~
I really hope that no one actually thinks that.

626~~~
Who's said he's better than Shaw? I don't see any posts on this pageat least!

627~~~
Really impressed with this youngster. Good composure on the ball.

628~~~
True but I just feel Shaw has that pace and agility that CBJ lacks, CBJ definitely has a better cross on him but Shaw has more of an ability to take players on which is suited to a winger I feel.

629~~~
He's better than shaw. <span style="color: #ffffff">Saying this to see how cassiusclaymore will react. :P</span>

630~~~
Yup agreed, it's an interesting situation.

631~~~
There'd be room for both. You need backup and I'm sure CBJ may have a future centrally too

632~~~
No, but he has been afforded more freedom to get forward than Shaw.

633~~~
Not a single person thinks this. People just give credit to unexpected graduate youngster..

634~~~
Hope you read the fine print there <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

635~~~
Besides, both are young and can add whatever skills they don't currently have. The basics are there

636~~~
Yeah and when we're losing a few games he's not good enough for the club.

People need to take a step back when it comes to assessing young players. Personally I'll withhold all hyperbole (positive or negative) until I've seen the likes of Borthwick-Jackson, Memphis and Januzaj performing under another manager. Hopefully next season.

637~~~
CBJ came on against WBA in the 65th minute when we had Jones blind and rojo fit for the game. He could have not played him that game as we were protecting a 1-0 lead but chose to play him anyway. So yes he deserves credit.

638~~~
OK. So i didnt remember that and decided to look a that match report.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34686915" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34686915</a>

Young was playing at RB. Rojo was playing at LB
Jones replaced Young at 62 minutes. Straight swap.
Rojo picked up a knock and was replaced by CBJ after then 76th minute
We had no other option. 
I'm done with this topic. I have said what I had to. If people think LVG deserves credit for this, I really dont care any more. I just dont agree.

639~~~
Chuffed for CBJ. He's not the finished product yet, and he'll encounter some setbacks, but hopefully at the end we have a player worthy of playing in an elite team.

640~~~
Haha people not giving credit for LVG for playing him are just fools

641~~~
He deserve some credit, but with the mass amount of injuries we have in defense, we have to ask what were the alternative option. 

Nevertheless, Credit to Val Gaal, he has given some of our youth chances which he rarely did in his first season unless due to injuries. I do fear a little for Botwick Jackson long term future, in particular when shaw is back fit. A manager like Pochettino utilizes the fullback position efficiently at Spurs by rotating which is what we need to due when Shaw is back fit, if Jackson develops properly.

642~~~
Yeh but LVG keeps a slim squad for that very reason... when there are injuries in any position he can then call on the best youth players to fill those roles rather than signing established bench warmers so in that respect he deserves ALL the credit. I know people dislike LVG ,but he needs credit when its due and I think his youth policy is nothing short of brilliant. The thing is if BoJack keeps playing like this then he wont be displaced from the team, his crossing as been excellent and his overall maturity is above his age group. Shaw will need to prove that he comes back as the same player but healthy competition is exactly how it should be.

643~~~
I do not believe we have a slim squad. When all of our players are fit, it is hard to find vacant backup role for youth players. In regards to my previous post, I forgot to add Rojo, who before his injury was Van Gaal preferred left back over Jackson.

644~~~
I know you might not like LVG but refusing to give him credit for giving CBJ a chance is ridiculous.

645~~~
We could always have had 3 at the back.  We have Mcnair &  Carrick fit.  We also have blind who can play LB but instead has been told to play CB whilst a young LB is bought jn. 

Obviously injuries mean something otherwise CBJ wouldn't be playing against the likes of Chelsea but end of the day we do have a small squad representing a team with that dont have to deal with UCL.  It looked like that from the start.

646~~~
Agreed. You can count maybe on one hand the amount of managers in world football who would have given him a chance to make his name in the first team.

That said his treatment of someone like Perreira arguably cancels out his achievements in this regard. Also injury has played a big hand in CBJ getting a chance, whereas in midfield despite players not being good enough or out of form.. LVG has been too weak to choose a youngster.

Overall though he has been pretty brilliant on the youth front I would say. He has given people chances bar Andreas.

647~~~
The thing with pereira is that Van gaal sometimes comes across players that he has no idea how to use but still regards them good enough indvidually.  Them fitting in to a team is a different matter.  

In that aspect Jamuzaj in the same as Pereira.

648~~~
Funny how depending on the agenda that one has the whole 'LVG's brilliant with youth' stuff changes. If he throws Depay on 5 minutes against Chelsea (to some) he's a cnut because he's young, undercooked, there's no need to play him at that time, too much responsibility, etc. At the same time it's okay that he starts a 19 year old BJ against Chelsea even though he plays in a more responsible position, is even less experienced, etc. 

How has LVG's great youth policy work out for Wilson when he was sitting on a bench for half a season doing feck all when Rooney was struggle to run nevermind kick the ball? How is it working out for Januzaj, Pereira? Where's Blackett from last season? Paddy McNair (who, remember, had some great reviews last season after certain games like against Everton iirc)? Keane was recalled from his loan over a month ago, how many games has he played despite firing in the u21s?

So yea, wondering how much his 'brilliant youth policy' is down to our injury crisis and pure luck and how much it really is his 'vision' regarding our youth players and eagerness to throw certain players into deep water.

649~~~
He has consciously gone with a smaller squad to give younger players chances. To not give him credit for one of them impressing is plain daft.

650~~~
For most international fans he's a complete unknown. He looks a bit skinny for the first team too. So, kudos to LVG for putting his faith in him. He's done really well to become a part of why our left side is so potent.

651~~~
It's easy to play youth when you have no other options and they do well. It's much harder to do so when you have other options and it's a conscious decision or they struggle at first.

He's done the former more often than not in my opinion. Once they've struggled or the senior player is fit they've disappeared out of the team.

I want to see more youngsters being rotated in and out of the team and bring given minutes here and there. Not this sink or swim because everyone else is crooked nonsense.

652~~~
How's getting rid of Chicharito, RVP, Nani for example helped BJ's case though? The only LB he got rid of this year was Reece James who was 21 himself. How many chances Wilson got from getting rid of RVP, Falcao and Chicharito? That's why I can't somehow understand why you'd call somebody a fool if one questions LVG's 'youth policy'.

Mind you that even Ashley Young played LB this season before CBJ, I don't criticise that decision but you have to have it at the back of your head.

653~~~
This mostly has to do with commen sense. Playing a player in their natural role is better for team balance than throwing players in roles they are not accustomed to. Having three in the back did not work before, so resorting back to that system will show poor managerial skills. Blind has been good in that Centerback role and has develop an understanding with Smalling, so once again when all things considered what we have now is the most reasonable option.

We currently have a small squad because of injury, else when all players fit, we do not have a small squad. Perhaps only in he striking department, but most club have three strikers these days with consideration that Wilson was party of his original plan.

654~~~
Wilson didn't impress enough in training. Even in the few matches he played(the Boro game) he was clearly too raw to play for Us. So we sent him on loan. CBJ took his chance. Not to mention players like martial and Memphis are themselves Young enough to be youth players.

655~~~
Wilson didn't impress enough in training but Rooney who couldn't score in a brothel impressed during games? Wilson featured in last two(?) games under Giggs and scored 2 goals iirc. CBJ impressed in training so hard that everybody else got injured and he got his chance? Problem with Wilson is that we didn't send him on loan for half a year, he was rotting on bench and in u21 matches. And no, we shouldn't really classify Memphis nor Martial as the youth guys because we've bought them and we're talking about intentional trimming of the squad so the youth can play, so buying them is contrary to what we're talking about here. It's obviously about our academy lads like CBJ.

656~~~
Wilson just doesn't fit an LVG team. His hold-up play isn't great - he's better at running in behind and using his pace, which our slow tempo meant he couldn't do at all.

When was the last time one of our players was played through one on one with the goalkeeper centrally after running in behind? I really can't remember this ever happening.

657~~~
I actually surprise that only a few can see this.Literally anyone who have watched enough of Wilson should have realized this.This is not the excuse for Wilson - he clearly need to improve his hold-up play but there're better ways to use him than how he has been used.Can't really blame LVG for not trusting Wilson but the fact that he's a poor tactician attacking-wise affected players such as Wilson,Mata or Memphis.

658~~~
Can he play right back?

659~~~
would eliminate one of his best skills - crossing, not sure if he can cross with his right as well as with his left.. but would defo try someone better than Darmian, Joe Riley or someone from the youth team, it can go any more wrong, darmian is clearly not manutd quality

660~~~
one of very few half decent performances today. Looks like he will continue to progress well given the opportunity. He looks very composed and his crossing ability is excellent

661~~~
Thought he did pretty well again, he just has that extra bit of quality on the ball that you don't see in many young defenders.

662~~~
One of the few players who did ok today. His crossing is one of the few threats the team has, which is really promising.

663~~~
Another impressive performance from the 19 year old. Good stuff.

664~~~
He should teach his team mates how to cross a football.

665~~~
We're gonna burn him out at this rate...

666~~~
Do you think he might fancy taking Valencia out for lunch and tell him how its done?

667~~~
Valencia would teach him how to cross the ball into the defenders ankles/stands.

668~~~
Sounds familiar to what weve done with quite a few players, playing them more than they should. Did it with Januzaj, Martial, memphis, Lingard.

669~~~
Eh?

670~~~
You've got to laugh.

671~~~
Januzaj in his season under moyes, we just kept playing him when we became so reliant on him.

Memphis earlier this season, look back on after he scored those goals in the CL qualifiers. We played him nearly every minute to the point we were still playing him when he was burnt out.

Martial around December (well actually since he scored against Liverpool). You can tell at times he looks absolutely shagged.

Lingard less so, but after he came on against City, we werent rotating enough.

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

672~~~
For a youngster he has quite a good understanding of the game as well. At this age you'd expect him to rely solely on his natural abilities but he is shown more than just tackles and crosses.

673~~~
He really should have more assists to his name given the quality of his crosses and lack of people attacking them.

674~~~
Well I disagree.

Depay played 90 minutes only 4 times in his first 10 games for us. Since then he has been a bit part player.

Martial might be young but he is fully physically developed. I don't see why he needs resting. He isn't being rested now and has come back into form.

Lingard is 23, he should be able to play 50 games in a season.

Januzaj only started 15 games in the league for us under Moyes. Even if he played 15 in a row, are you saying that he couldn't manage that?

675~~~
He is creating some decent chances.. Wonder how a Costa would have dealt with them, knowing he is always going to drop the ball between the goalkeeper and CBs..

676~~~
Looks a very good prospect indeed. I wonder how he'd fare as a right back.

677~~~
Becoming one of my favourite players.

678~~~
Is he naturally a centre back?

679~~~
Why would you do that.

680~~~
Always rated him highly, but never thought he would adpat so quickly, shames he is not a rightback

681~~~
I'm just thinking ahead to when Shaw comes back. I'd hate to see CJB go back to being an understudy.

682~~~
Can he play Center back ??

683~~~
Fair enough, but yes, because people develop differently at different stages of their career, but even so, whilst you may not burn out physically you can still burn out mentally (which can then have an effect on your confidence).

Football has come to a point where rotation is necessary and rest is required esp for younger players to keep them having a long career. 23 is still young in a normal football career, players like Messi and ronaldo are not the norm.

684~~~
Yes.

He's still got a lot to learn and improve on, people need to relax. He'll be perfectly fine being backup to Shaw.

685~~~
Fair point, but he's still so young. Shaw will rightly come back as first choice, and I'm sure CBJ will still get plenty of chances himself (imo he looks a little weak to play at CB right now, but as others have said, he can play there), especially now we've all seen what he can do.

686~~~
Or Hernandez :P

687~~~
He gets better each game he plays. He's a decent crosser of the ball and has a good turn of speed. He might be a bit slight to play centre half at this level though.

688~~~
Seeing as the only times we are inside the opposition box is at corners, that might not be a bad idea actually. We are that woeful. Good that LVG chooses to focus on possession.

689~~~
He's a bit good, isn't he? Consistently whips in beautiful crosses and is always a threat going forward. 

Really happy for him that he's broken in.

690~~~
Its a shame. This team needs a poacher.

691~~~
Second best full back at the club after Shaw. Shame they both play on the same side.

692~~~
Another good performance today for the young lad, one of the only ones who didn't let us down.

693~~~
I keep waiting for him to have a letdown but it's not happened. Really pleased with/for him.

694~~~
He was outstanding in the first half. Always full-blooded in his tackles and runs. Bit harder in the second as he was isolated but still held his ground.

695~~~
Doesn't seem the quickest(acceleration) especially on the turn so he'd have to read the game better because he'll struggle to recover like Shaw does(Luke is gifted with frankly mind blowing mid range acceleration).

696~~~
His crossing is magical at times.

Learning the game well as he goes along, good competition though obviously still young and learnin' to Shaw.

697~~~
That myth that young players can't play every game because they burn out, it's just bollocks. If your a young player you want to play every game you can and you feel fitted and stronger than ever, I think this myth stems from when young players get injured namely Owen who struggled when young. Truth is most of these guys could play hundreds of games back to back and their bodies could handle it.

698~~~
He's really come along after a very catious (understandably) first few games. 

Does anyone know what his contract situtation is? Hopefully, he won't be tempted by the promise of first team football elsewhere once Shaw comes back.

699~~~
I think I'd trust SAF's opinion more than yours on that. He used to bang on about it a lot and contributed it to some of his young Aberdeen players not lasting

700~~~
No CBJ in the squad for the EL game?

701~~~
He's ill. Wonder who plays at left back then? 3-5-2 with Januzaj?

702~~~
Adnan is cup tied. Could be Blind, Love, Riley, or someone completely random.

703~~~
Memphis <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

704~~~
How about as a winger? Does he have enough speed? He can cross and controls the ball well.

705~~~
It was rumoured recently that he'll be signing a new 5 year deal with a 500x increase in pay (although this would put him on £10k pw it seems he, or his management team, might be reluctant to sign on the dotted line for such a long deal tying him to such comparatively low wages for a first team regular) either way they'd better hurry up as his current contract runs out this summer!

706~~~
I love this kid. Make him our future left back and convert Shaw to a libero. It plays to both their strengths.

707~~~
LVG confirms he's injured - hence his substitution.

708~~~
Christ sake. More injuries.

709~~~
sigh

710~~~
Shit. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I thought he'd just come off to keep him fresh.

711~~~
Feck.

712~~~
Shit.

Something needs sorting. These injuries are not just unlucky. Not training on a deso pitch and other changes should be tried out.

713~~~
No wonder we can't get the best young players if we're only paying them £20 a week.

714~~~
Hope it's not serious,we actually look half decent with him at LB. will need him for the next few games.

715~~~
Exactly! Although they might chop that in half now he's crocked!

716~~~
He didn't look injured going into the half did he? Hopefully it's more precautionary than anything

717~~~
What are our fullbacks doing? How are they all getting injured?!

718~~~
I'm blaming you

719~~~
van Gaal said in the post match presser that he had to sub him at HT because he was injured

720~~~
Haha... Injuries are part and parcel of the game, unlucky for us but they happen all the same.

721~~~
Any updates on the injury? Hope it's nothing serious.

722~~~

Was apparently dropped off to training by his mum so can't be that bad! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

723~~~
Or it means he can't drive because of the injury. 

Aside from that what is with these articles? It's almost poking fun at him for being dropped to training by his mother. Last week they had another article about him driving a Corsa. 

Trying to shame the kid into buying a sports car or something. Then they'll write another piece on him being a big shot, a la Depay. 

Gutter gutter press.

724~~~
Build them up to knock them down. Or in this case, knock them down then build them up and then knock them down again.

725~~~
Was literally just thinking of writing something like this … agree 100% <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

726~~~
Agree completely. 

He's quickly become one of my favourite players in this squad. Really enjoy watching him.

727~~~
Yeah any of these papers such as The Mirror are absolute rags. How is this even news?

My take on it would be different than yours, though: To me, it appears that the angle they are going for is more along the lines of 'oh look, a footballer isn't driving around in a £70,000 personalised Range Rover' - haha lolz, what kind of a modern day footballer is he'.

728~~~
Any news on him? Can he make it back for any of our games this week? Asking for a friend who is a big fan of his, and also has him in his fantasy team.

729~~~
Unlikely, LvG would have probably played him for the reserves tonight if he had been.

730~~~
It's intended as a cute story not a character assassination. Wind your necks in.

731~~~
You think? I would guess if he was anywhere near ready for a starting spot on Wednesday he wouldn't have been involved for the reserves tonight. And it looks as though he's been training?

Oh well. I think he's our best left back option without Shaw involved, so a bit of a blow as far as I'm concerned that he's not available.

732~~~
Maybe he hasn't passed his driving test yet?

733~~~
Was there not a story about Chris Smalling rocking up to his first day at training with United in a £500 Corsa?

734~~~
Any update, pretty much disappeared since Shrewsbury...

735~~~
Hope he's back soon, miss his whipped crosses

736~~~
Any worries of him looking to leave if he doesn't get games when Shaw is back. Hopefully not as him and Shaw would have the LB position sorted for years.

737~~~
both will be needed. Shaw was injured a lot in his first year here, perhaps that'll be a consistent. Who knows, CBJ may overtake him.

738~~~
If Shaw is consistently fit the Borthwick-Jackson won't get a game because it's not like an attacker where ya can replace them in the second half. Ya don't do that with full-backs that are settled.

739~~~
Players will be rested and CBJ will get his chance. There's a gap between the two but its not as big as lets say Maldini and Philip Neville. I fancy CBJ chances.

Feck you CBJ, I hope he doesn't do a John OShit on me

740~~~
He is a Manchester lad so hopefully he will be happy with his role next seaon whatever it is as him and Shaw are both quality full-backs that will have that position sorted for the years ahead.

741~~~
I hope so. After John OShit I vowed not to get too excited about young defenders who shown promise and guess what, I was able to keep that promise with Smalling, Jones, Evans and the crocked twins. However I confess that Im finding it hard not to be carried away by CBJ. Doing that well, at that age, in a defense which is so shit is something that demands respect.

742~~~
I don't comment loads and loads so maybe its a running joke I've missed that you insult our ex players whenever possible but good god man it's fecking tedious.

743~~~
But its not meant as an insult. That's exactly what I said whenever he played with us (after his first season)

744~~~
we don't know if Shaw will be half the player when he comes back, so its a premature conversation. But lets agree that CBJ has made the loss of Shaw more bearable.

745~~~
I doubt we'll see much of CBJ now that Rojo is fit. A real shame as he looks twice the player the Argentine does.

746~~~
Can only hope that's not the case, because CBJ and Shaw battling it out for left back for the next decade or so is a far more exciting proposition than Rojo stinking up our left side with after shave and brylcreem for years to come.

747~~~
Hopefully he'll get booted out the door with this useless manager mate.

748~~~
Yep Rojo is dire and looks like he is here on a jolly. CBJ every day of the week for me over him.

749~~~
I feel for him as he has got injured at the worst time for him. His future will probably depend on who the new manager is, As much as I think we need Jose he isn't one that plays alot of younger players so CBJ may not get alot of opportunities under him.

750~~~
Looking forward to this lad coming back. Should bring a bit more of a sense of calm to the defence than Rojo

751~~~
He started for the England U19's.

Good to see he's back!

752~~~
Good. Hopefully there's non of this match rhythm crap now and he's straight back in the starting eleven.

753~~~
Good to see him back.

754~~~
Rojo is so poor both defensively and going forwards. He is an ok CB but is a terrible LB. Basically nullifies our attack that side. Will be good for Martial to have CBJ back and even better with a fully fit Shaw.

755~~~
If Blind's injury keeps him out of the Everton game we should see CBJ back in at LB with Rojo partnering Smalling.

756~~~
Our best left back option after Shaw, very much looking forward to seeing him back in the team.

757~~~
I actually thought Rojo was very good for argentina before and after we bought him, he is okay on the ball but that was a very defensive outfit and he was excellent at sitting deep. 

If Mourinho comes in we will likely be a very defensive and deep outfit and he might be the preferred left back in a flatter back four, I think we would see the best of him

758~~~
Knowing LVG, it is more likely that CBJ will play as CB and Rojo as LB. Because Foundations and some other shit.

759~~~
He was good in the World Cup, at left wing back

760~~~
he was at left wing back but that was a very very defensive outfit, and he played inside left a few times for argentina over that period too and was solid

761~~~
this.

762~~~
No way. Mourinho would absolutely love Shaw, he just can't be beaten defensively.

763~~~
Shaw as a centre-back who brings the ball out of defense and is impossible to beat on the counter. CBJ as a left-back who fires in the best crosses of anyone in the league.

I could see Mourinho setting up like that, especially as he likes to have his wingers drift into the box quite a bit. Our full-backs will need to be able to offer decent end-product and BoJack is better at that than Shaw. It would also balance out the squad, seeing as we have too many LBs and not enough CBs.

764~~~
Mourinho played Ashley Cole for years and his crossing / shooting was never anything special. Very similar qualities to Shaw in general in fact.

765~~~
Cole was a very good crosser for a full-back. A lot better than Shaw has shown so far.

766~~~
Shaws biggest asset is his pace and power running from deep. Why on earth would he be played at CB?

767~~~
Nah, he wasn't. Perhaps marginally better than Evra. He rarely got more than one or two assists a season the way I remember it, and yet he got forward to create space very well.

768~~~
How far along is CBJ? Physioroom has him off our injured list. Has he played a game for the reserves yet?

769~~~
Played the last match vs Chelsea

770~~~
thanks. hope he gets back into the first team soon

771~~~
He's got to play instead of Rojo, he's been our best crosser of the ball this season and looked far more solid than Rojo who just never convinces me at LB.

772~~~
He's very tidy on the ball and has a sweet left foot but I'm still not sure he's a left back. Defensively I'd say Rojo is better in that position. Just not sure CBJ has the mobility and quick change of direction needed for LB.

As a centre back though I think he'd be better than Rojo.

773~~~
I find Rojo more rash both positionally and in his passing though. Oddly CBJ has great maturity in his game in comparison.

774~~~
Probably the best crosser of the ball among our fullbacks.

Agreed.  I liked what I saw from Rojo early on and still think he's got a decent game of football in him but he's been poor for us for a while now and needs to be dropped in favor of Bo-Jack.

Like Angel, Marcos may just not like being a United man.  I say cut the bait this summer.  We're deep at left back anyway and I wouldn't trust him now at CB.

776~~~
A non entity going forward but I think defensively Rojo has done well at LB. 

CBJ has got that tall, lanky stature that I don't think suits fullback. Up against wingers I think you need that low centre of gravity to twist, turn etc.

Imagine his composure and ball playing at CB though. If he can add a bit of meat to his bones we could have a proper defender.

777~~~
I think he is the best option for left back at this time. hope he gets back to the first team

778~~~
Did very well against Chelsea I thought. Looked like he might have gained a bit of muscle.

779~~~
He's simply better than Rojo in every aspect of the game. Rojo has been a letdown. Jackson is way more composed and positionally sound than Rojo

780~~~
What's he played? Five or six full games? Simply nowhere near enough to start judging his positional and defensive ability.

781~~~
Varela is excellent .

782~~~
12 appearances & very few mistakes, in fact been consistently one of our better players in just about every games he's played. When a young player comes in and simply doesn't look out of place & performs exceptionally well & improved game on game. Then we can start to think he may actually be the real deal. 
Is pretty easy to pick up on a defenders positional awareness, doesn't take a full season to see if a defender has awareness of what's going on around him. You can spot it everytime they come up against a top level player they mark.

783~~~
It is about six full games. They include Sheffield United, Derby, Bournemouth, Sunderland, Stoke and Chelsea.

I'm a big fan of the youth players but that's just not enough of a test for us to be declaring he's a better defender than Rojo. Not as a left back anyway where Rojo has been pretty solid.

784~~~
He's played 800 minutes which is almost 9 full games and Rojo hasn't been pretty solid at all. He is incredibly inconsistent at defending, and is completely absent of a brain on the ball.

785~~~
On the ball I agree, already stated that.

As a left back though he's defended pretty well. I know it's not fashionable to say so but it's true.

6 full games or 9 games worth of minutes, what's the difference given the context? Neither is enough to judge a young lad.

786~~~
And he's meant to be a footballer, using the ball is pretty damn important. He was just completely rinsed by Deulofeu and has been average at best defensively. 6 and 9 completely different numbers so that is the difference. When is it enough to judge a young player? Is 1400 minutes enough to judge a shite one?

787~~~
I think you're letting Rojo's performances at CB taint your opinion here. We're discussing defending as a left back.

There's not set time on when to judge a player but if a youngster shows promise a full season would be start. Not 6 or 9 games.

If he was to have four poor games presumably your opinion would swing the other way and he'd be declared not good enough?

That's the problem with making judgements based on very little game time. Your opinion will constantly be in flux.

788~~~
It wouldn't change because I've watched him put in impressive performances for the u18s, u19s, u21s, and now the first team. Having some poor games is the part of any young player but he has shown he is capable of good performances and has the potential to get even better. I'd much rather use CBJ and risk the occasional poor game than stick with Rojo who has proven to not be good enough and despite his experience still has runs of poor games. I'd rather it be a young player who is actually going to learn from those poor games than one who is brain dead and doesn't learn a thing.  

I'm not letting his performances at CB taint anything because if anything, he is a better CB than LB. Since his return he has only played at LB, he has been rinsed by Deulofeu, rinsed by bloody Jesus Navas, he had Dawson looking like Roberto Carlos in comparison, he is caught up field and out position despite not actually offering an attacking threat. That isn't even getting into his biggest issue of just being a complete and utter idiot. He has absolutely no clue of whats going around him, no awareness, thinks he is fecking amazing on the ball despite being shite and regularly gives the ball away for no reason. At his best he can be a backup player but he is either injured or acting an eejit too often to even play at his best. Why on earth would you even want him as a backup over a young player who actually shows some potential and currently performs better anyway? He is as inconsistent as a young player without the upside.

789~~~
true. with shaw still on his way back hopefully CBJ is back and should be our starting LB instead of rojo, or even darmian.

790~~~
I wouldn't want Rojo over CBJ, nowhere have I said that. I'd use CBJ because his ability on the ball is much better. He just hasn't had the game time or the tests to prove his defensive ability.

791~~~
Promising homegrown talent > a confirmed average local/foreign talent. That's how I think

792~~~
Watching him run is more entertaining by itself than most of the 'football' we play these days.

793~~~
Yeah but it could be argued that out attacking width hasn't been as good since he's been out the side. I understand you are thinking defensively, but I think his outlet going forward moots all else. It's great to have a player, who puts in early crosses. I think Rojo and Darmian lack that quality (thus far).

794~~~
Why on earth isn't he starting for us, seeing he played 2 games for the reserves? He is much better choice than Rojo who is terrible at the moment. So much about van Gaal trusting the youth, plays them only when he has no other choice.

795~~~
He only just returned from injury.

796~~~
Didn't prevent Ashley Young playing 45 minutes as a striker, or Jones being on the bench, or Rooney starting next game.

797~~~
Rooney hasn't started anything yet. Ashley Young has done a lot more in his United career than CBJ so far. Jones wasn't on the bench. He has been fit for one game and left out, give it some time. There is no need to bitch about every single decision.

798~~~
It is when we have Rojo playing ahead of him. Who will probably play again next game considering CBJ played tonight.

799~~~
Rojo has been pretty solid ?
Marcos Rojo yeah?
The guy with tattoos and a stupid haircut ? He's been solid? Marcos rojo? Rojo? Marcos rojo has been solid ?

The moment cbj returned to full training he should have been in the squad. 
Rojo has proven to be terrible since he walked into the club last July. Cbj played about 3 games and looked a vastly superior full back.

800~~~
I'm not a big fan of Rojo or anything. I said earlier in this thread I'd rather have CBJ at left back.

The point I was making is that when a player falls out of favour with fans every mistake gets highlighted. For instance a poster in this thread pointed out that Deulofeu beat him a couple of times. As if that's proof of him being shit. I'd imagine Deulofeu could beat most fullbacks, including CBJ.

Terrible going forward but at left back he has been defensively ok during his time here. Reading this forum every defender at the club has been shit yet somehow we have the second best defensive record in the league. Something doesn't add up.

801~~~
That's the funny thing, he doesn't actually make many big mistakes that you can point out, it's just his general terrible impersonation of a man united full back. I forget he's playing a lot of the time because he rarely provides attacking support and he also hides away in defensive situations. I've also never seen a full back pass the ball out of play as much as him.

As for the comments about the cafe calling all our defence shit, I can only speak for myself but Smalling , De Gea and Blind have been 3 of our 4 best players this season. That's not to say Blind has been great but he's been played out of his position all year by his terrible manager and done well.
Luckily for us Darmian and Rojo have missed large parts of the season through injury otherwise that defensive record would look a lot worse than it is.

802~~~
We only conceded 37 last season with Rojo playing more frequently. Not saying he's anything better than average but he's defensively at least not the disaster some like to suggest.

803~~~
Is he still injured?

804~~~
No, he's played the last two U21 games.

805~~~
Hope he hasn't been frozen out of the 1st team picture

806~~~
With him being young I imagine he's just been given a more thorough run out before being brought back in, although this being LvG who knows. Given how absolutely garbage Rojo has been lately he should be starting on Saturday.

807~~~
He has been back a week and just played 90 minutes on Monday. If he never plays again this season and Rojo continues to start then we can worry about it.

808~~~
He's had a couple of issues with his health recently which is why they're taking they're time putting him back in

809~~~
What health problems?

810~~~
Not really my place to say on here but he seems to be over them now since he played for the England u19s a couple of weeks ago and has played the last 2 u21 games

811~~~
That's good. He really should be playing ahead of Rojo on merit.

812~~~
Fair enough. I hope he starts vs Aston Villa.

813~~~
What's happened to him? Thought he'd have been in the match day squad by now. Did he sign his new deal?

814~~~
I believe he did in February. He's been featuring for the U21s. We could do with his beautifully whipped crosses in these final crucial games

815~~~
Rojo is shite from set pieces, which I imagine is the reason he is playing. This lad should be in the squad.

816~~~
Jackson>>>No go Rojo

817~~~
"I believe in Youth..."

Yet, not one fecker is pulling him up over this. CBJ, while having a bit to learn, is already miles ahead of The Onion. Yet, he's dropped for him

818~~~
No idea why he has gone out of the team after his injury. Twice the player Rojo is at both ends of the pitch.

819~~~
Not defending LVG here, but I think it's good idea for CBJ to stay off the first team for now. Suddenly we were back to top 4 race because City tried hard to give it to us. We have enough shit players to blame on. However, it would affect young players like CBJ badly if he makes one of these mistakes. I don't trust LVG's man-management. See what happened with McNair after a good debut honeymoon.

Not saying this is LVG intention, I doubt him being this thoughtful tbh. Just saying this may be a blessing in disguise.

820~~~
This is the thing though, CBJ is better than Rojo. Miles better!! And even if he did feck up, the fans would be more forgiving and understanding....

Also, what race for the top 4? There is no race mate unfortunately

821~~~
I see what you did there. I agree there was no race in fan's eyes. Only in our manager's mind.

However, the buffoon acting as our manager would not be forgiving. He has his own favorite. He nearly made Smalling as our sub if not for Jones injury (not fond of our player being injured, but that's a blessing in disguise too). He destroyed Rashford in Totenham game at half time by the rumor for whatever reason, and into 2nd half subbed Young in as central forward! If not for Carrick (?) intervened and Rashford being mentally strong, he would go into the Januzaj's path. By the outsider's view, the problem lies mainly with the manager's tactic and management, but he himself doesn't see it. Therefore, it's better for some of them to stay away. Not everyone is mentally strong enough for this kind of old school management. And defender is more prone to error. Let's him work to overcome his weakness in lower level than getting thrown in and being exposed => that would kill his game time at senior level altogether. Because when a defender's weakness being pointed out, every team would try to exploit that. You can't shift a defender around too much, so by that time he would solely relied on U21 football or go on loan and hope the coach there is brave enough to play him and help him overcome the weakness. Someone with natural gifted physical and defensive quality like Shaw had a bad first season under LVG, so let's not rush our youngster being thrown into hot water here.

822~~~
This is literally all Hector Moreno's fault.

823~~~
This guy needs to play. That volleyed cross for the U21s the other night, yiiiiss.

824~~~
It's possible he's been frozen out due to not signing the contract? He knows he won't be a starter for us, and he'll have a bunch of clubs going for him in the summer with a nice signing fee.

825~~~

826~~~
Shame he misplaced that pass once, but no way he should play again after doing such an awful thing.

827~~~
How he doesn't play instead of Rojo I don't know

828~~~
Has he played a PL game since his mistake against Chelsea?

829~~~
hasn't featured in PL since 2-1 loss vs sunderland back in Feb.

830~~~
I honestly can't recall where we went wrong in that game, just an awful all round performance. I wonder why he's not been brought back into the squad, especially given how bad Rojo has been.

831~~~
I'd be interested to see if he can play CB. He's not going to be starting left back any time soon.

832~~~
He has probably not been brought back because Rojo is a first team player, and he is not injured. Van Gaal only uses the youth when the first team players are injured unless they've done as well as Rashford has done. I'd argue CBJ has been more consistent than Rashford tbh, bizarre mind LVG has.

833~~~
Well done to him, my favourite left back in the squad after shaw although not entirely convinced he is the under 21's best player, but he is one of the best players from that team in terms of performance with the first team. He's been thrown under the bus like a lot of our young players do after not putting a foot wrong, I can literally only imagine Rojo is picked because LVG thinks Rojo is great in the air as he always has him marking the oppositions best headers, we've lost two goals from the last 3 or 4 games because of this.

834~~~
We climbed back into the race for the top 4 trophy because of the contributions of young players like Cameron. To see him benched for Rojo is disappointing.

835~~~
Depressing, annoying, frustrating .... with the way the season has gone people have tried to find something good about LVG management and that has been the use of youth. CBJ was very good, way better than any other left back that replaced Shaw and should have slotted right back in when fit but, Rojo starting ahead of him only gives credence to what many have said - LVG only played so much youth because he lacked any other options. 

Based on how poor Rojo was the last 2 games, hopefully CBJ will get his earned place back for the rest of the season.

836~~~
Out of contract in the summer?

837~~~
Really? What the feck is going on with him.

838~~~
His award at the very beginning. Warren Joyce's part is very interesting.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXsztIbOcc0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

839~~~
''He was always doing extra pieces of training''  then the camera pans to Januzaj in the middle of saying that and he looks completely shocked that someone would work hard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

840~~~
The whole event was so embarrassing...
<ul>
<li>Van Gaal addressing De Gea to Madrid and awkward marriage questions of Edurne.</li>
<li>Van Gaal's speech in general (also claiming we showed fighting spirit by drawing 1-1 against Liverpool at Old Trafford)  and his weird rhetorical questions to the host.</li>
<li>Rooney admitting he voted for Blind then handing Smalling the award.</li>
<li>How David didn't win the players award, so obvious it was planned.</li>
<li>Drunk fan shouting throughout "Louis Van Gaal's army" and that he believes in him.</li>
</ul>
Can't even imagine how bad it would have been if we weren't in an FA Cup final as everyone was just clinging onto that in every speech made.

841~~~
Just watched video and I agree, especially about LvG bringing up Madrid. Totally inappropriate.

If LvG was my manager from everything you see and hear, I wouldn't want to play under him.

842~~~
Aye, Adnan must not remember all the times Joyce and McGuinness lavished him with praise for his hard work and attitude.

843~~~
Cameron Borthwick-<b>Johnson</b>?

844~~~
Not really sure but with Varela,CBJ and Riley all not in the U21s squad yesterday I could smell another fullback crisis.

845~~~
He and Varela are out best fullbacks currently available and neither are getting game time, really hope we don't lose them.

846~~~
Valencia is way way better defensively than Varela & is a far more reliable option. Darmain, is a better right back, just he's under performed for us so far. Fully agree on CBJ, best left back at the club, bar Shaw pre injury.

847~~~
And Varela is way better than Valencia offensively, take in consideration that we struggle going forward and not defending and he seems the better option to me.

848~~~
Quite disgraceful that the clown Rojo gets ahead of him. Can't wait for LVG to feck off.

849~~~
Actually I think Valencia has been doing as good as varela lately. You just have to look at him in the games then look at who got assist or 'key passes' for our goals lately.

I myself would start CBJ over rojo though. There is something very wrong about that at that moment with our lines up.

850~~~
He voted for Blind, Chris Smalling comes out of a random ballot among the players for PPOTY. What on earth about that is embarrassing?.........

851~~~
Yeah. Not like Blind has been too far from him. Good to know players rate him as what he is instead of calling for pace and power shit which would be the only way to become a good CB or something.

852~~~
People are too fixed with that these days when judging players. Not saying it's bad thing at all but there's other ways you can be a good player. Pogba for one really overrated because of his physique and the few wonder goals.

853~~~
Funny if you think that most of the people here talk shit about how bad England's set up from the root to top and therefore they can't do any good against other teams who have no problem adjusting with 'modern football'.

Then we get a manager with most of those so called modern football's 'vision' playing possession football, using intelligent footballers in some positions, making players to think etc.

And we get probably same fans talking about how pace and power rules, possession football is dull and shit, intelligent footballers means nothing we need pace and power everywhere and killing players instincts etc.

I am not saying LVG has been successful here. He has been mostly shit. But, yeah.

854~~~
What is he doing jogging out there when Norwich are breaking? Shocking stuff.

855~~~
literally jogged at half speed all the way back. 

He is half asleep out there.

856~~~
You can hardly ever tell if he's sprinting or jogging to be fair. Always runs the same way.

857~~~
His running style looks like he is jogging.. but is he really jogging

858~~~
Has been poor today.

859~~~
Put in two absolute beauties if we had a half way competent striker on the field we might have scored from one of them. Overall not his best but this is his first game back in the first team in some time, it can be forgiven.

860~~~
His crossing is lovely. 

He does look like a TRex when hes running though.

861~~~
Yeah he can go for free in the summer - ridiculous if so but might explain why he hasn't played much if he is refusing to sign a deal.

862~~~
Probably his poorest game for us today, looked nervy which is odd as his calmness had been impressive in his other games.

863~~~
Wasnt at his best. But didnt deserve the burial Danny Mills was giving him throughout the game. In a lot of ways he was a product of how shit the whole team played. He certainly didnt deserve to be singled out when there was a few players who matched him in that stake.

864~~~
He's already agreed a contract extension

865~~~
Crosses were good, defending was awful. One shocking clearance header and managed to fall over, leaving his man to head wide, at one of Norwich's free-kicks in the 2nd half.

866~~~
Shhh let the panic stricken carry on & not know they mystical powers of the Google

867~~~
About time he got another chance, it's been long overdue but don't think he had a good game today.

868~~~
?

According to the 'mystical powers of the Google' his contract is expiring in the summer and he hasn't signed anything yet.

869~~~
I didn't say it's signed I said it's agreed

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Manchester United starlet Cameron Borthwick-Jackson agrees new contract after breakthrough season</b></span>

871~~~
Good.

872~~~
Nice one

873~~~
I really want to see this lad at CB. I like the that he's composed all-round, he's good on the ball, stays on his feet, doesn't go to ground for a tackle, Defends intelligently and he's 6ft 2" as of now which means he's taller than all our CB's other than Smalling. I believe he could go on to develop into a solid CB. I don't think he has enough pace to play at LB, we have Shaw at LB that does have the pace and will obviously be the main man there, I'd like CBJ to be given a shot at CB so we're not limiting his game time or development.

874~~~
I feel the same, would like him to grow into his frame a little first. He could be immense if he put on 4 or 5 kilos

875~~~
He will probably miss pre-season training. Currently in the U19 squad for two friendlies against Mexico and he should be also in the squad for the Euro U19 Championships in July (12-24) in Germany.

876~~~
Big season for him next season. No guarantees at how Shaw will come back from injury, and CBJ is the best left back we have apart from Shaw.

877~~~
Isn't pre-season training more important for him and the club to prepare for the upcoming season than to play Euro U19 Championship?

878~~~
If Rojo starts the final I'll cry. Been great tonight.

879~~~
This.

880~~~
Forgot how blank his face is during a match.. Looks completely unfazed, hopefully he gets to compete with Shaw for the LB spot next season.

881~~~
Very promising player

882~~~
He's really quite good this lad. Great on the ball.

883~~~
Very composed, both defensively and going forward, looks a great prospect. Hopefully he will start at Wembley.

884~~~
Laughable how much better he is than Rojo at left back.

885~~~
I like him, he keeps me calm.

I like being calm.

886~~~
Very impressive. Him, Martial and Rashford are just about the only plus points of this season.

887~~~
Pretty much flawless today.

Passing, movement, decisions but also couldn't be any calmer which is just another sign of maturity at this point.

888~~~
He was a bit uninspiring in the first half, I'd like to see him do more in terms of attacking, be more explosive, that's what he lacks now, he looks too calm IMO but that can change... the cross and the cut in was really impressive though, hope to see him share some time in the first team with Shaw next season

889~~~
I thought he was a bit sloppy in the first half but had a good second.

890~~~
Agree with the calls for him to start over Rojo - if not for Rashford, then he might well have been the story of the season <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

891~~~
Classy player, looked nervous and abit sloppy first half but grew back into the from we saw a couple months ago from him. He's so much better than Rojo it's scary, let's hope that Rojo still has the shits this weekened.

892~~~
He doesn't look up before he crosses the ball.

Sign of a dreadful player.

893~~~
Him or Rojo? There really isn't a choice to make.

Started rusty, but once he was up to speed he was great. Another cracking cross no one bothers to attack.

894~~~
Shame he isn't a right back. Him and Shaw would be a potential great fullback partnership going forward.

895~~~
Should start the final.

896~~~
We look so much better with him playing instead of Rojo. Was a couple of times I hoped he would be a bit more greedy though, but his passing is still good

897~~~
Fosu-Mensah? Varela?

898~~~
Where does he play when Shaw returns?

899~~~
Just bin Rojo and let's the lad plays every game Rojo's supposed to play.

900~~~
I'll wait a little longer before I can really say how good Fosu-Mensah is and Varela hasn't been given a chance consistently enough for me to be able to say whether he is up to the job longer term. I have very little doubt over the aforementioned trio of players however; Martial, Borthwick-jackson and Rashford have all looked the real deal this season.

901~~~
Agree with a lot of the posts already in this thread. Great signs for CBJ's future with us. Promising performances so far.

902~~~
Agree

903~~~
How is this guy not even in the squad and Rojo is most likely starting... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>????

904~~~
LVG's fantastic youth development and laying foundations obviously.

905~~~
He's a funny sort of player this guy, strange way of running with his arms, and a very disinterested sort of look about him, like him though.

906~~~
He's the shy guy from the 80's who's in the end gonna win karate tournament against his old master after intense training montage of him 'runnning with his arms' to top of the concrete stairs.

907~~~
He come's across like a non giver of fecks bit is obviously just very shy, cool and calm. Even that video of Lingards when the bus was coming under attack, all the players were rolling around the floor expect Bo-Jack who was just sittin chilling wondering what all the fuss was about.

908~~~
He's got a languid style. You don't see that too often in defensive roles. It doesn't mean he gives less of a feck. I think he's been one of the few positives this season.

909~~~
He must be one of our best crossers of the ball. It almost always goes into a dangerous area (that area behind the defence but away from the keeper to come and grab it).

910~~~
Bad attitude and lack of professionalism? That seems to be the most obvious reason with our young players under LvG . Can't wait till he packs his bags!

911~~~
Lets be honest, he was never going to start the final.

912~~~
He's not even in the squad, wtf<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

913~~~
That's what they said about Fabio.

914~~~
How come though? Like Rojo has been so extraordinary good when he's played lately?...

915~~~
I'm not saying he isn't better, I'm just saying LVG favours Rojo for some reason.

916~~~
Ye, unfortunatly he does. I find it quite bizarre specially when Rojo has been weak lately while CBJ really put in some great performances before he got injured.

917~~~
He reminds me of a Tyrannosaurus rex

Good news.
