2nd choice striker ?

Been lack of talk about him recently and unless we sign someone else for the striker's role he should get plenty of game time.

Well he would atleast in pre season for sure as long as he stays fit. Could it be his real breakthrough year ?

2~~~
Doesnt look like a LVG type of striker to me to be fair, he's so fast and direct, he's best suited with a no 10 behind him, giving through balls or him being able to drift out and go pick the ball and dribble towards the goal. This isnt really possible as a lonely striker in a LVG set up, but we'll see I guess. Hope he does breakthrough this season, he has some huge qualities and seems highly rated by his teammates and the staff.

3~~~
Could do with a goal, an assist, or something, as he still seems off the pace. Hasn't happened for him in the 2 pre-season games so far. I suppose you could say Rooney hasn't done much either. Wilson's link-up play is underwhelming to say the least. At first team level I don't get the sense that his team-mates understand his strengths and weaknesses. Off the top of my head, the QPR game last season is the only time he looked a consistent threat and that was on the break late on when we were leading.

4~~~
He looks like one of those players who has lots of trouble making the step up from playing against kids to playing against adults.  I hope he gets a loan sooner rather than later.

5~~~
Look I know that James Wilson hasn't performed well in either of the two pre-season games but it seems like a lot of people are now suddenly coming out that he isn't good enough. The kid is 19 years old and has shown great promise in the few games he has been given so I just don't see how people can write him off from two games of 45 mins in a second string team. The fickle nature of football fans drives me mad.

6~~~
Wilson is a great prospect but he isn't good enough <b>yet. </b>

7~~~
The thing is our lack of strikers at the moment means this is a perfect oppurtunity for him to take his chance and he hasnt done that so far.

8~~~
Can you honestly say that many of the players have yet tho. We really can't take anything away from the two games so far, so perhaps the Barca and PSG games will show more but I suspect it will be more evident once the season starts for real

9~~~
He's got really broad shoulders. Once he fills out I think he'll be a bit of a beast. Until then, I wouldn't play him as a lone striker with his back to goal. I'd be giving him run outs as a wide forward or maybe in a 2 up front.

10~~~
Agree with that completely. He looks like he's at his best running in behind in the channels which it doesn't look like our lone striker will be doing much of this season.
I know it doesn't look like he'll be starting any time soon but I think he'd be a good impact sub if we're chasing a game & want to play more than one striker or if we're holding on & need someone to give us an out ball.

He's still learning & growing & I think that type of role should realistically be all we expected of him this season

11~~~
continued where he left off last season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> i am amazed and shocked how poor he looks on that pitch, 2 years ago he was flying and was unstopabble, cant really explain it to myself what happened. Remember last season at the begining, first game of the season against City in Lancashire Senior Cup, thought he grown little to much over the summer so he lost little of his balance. But then after 45 minute of pretty average play he picked the ball in the middle of the pitch, went past few players and scored, in second half he scored 2 or 3 more not sure right now so i gave up on my idea. Now, year after i think i was on to something because thats the only logical explanation i have. Seen it many times, someone grows quickly in short period of time and he loses his balance, center of coordination and it affects your game practically in every segment. Hope he recovers quickly because its so sad to watch him this days.....

12~~~
This sounds like your talking about a veteran, he's 19 years old people are expecting way too much

13~~~
I think he'd benefit from some games in the wide positions of the front 4, he's very fast and can dribble but his hold-up play isn't good enough right now for a #9 at senior level.

14~~~
dont think i am to be fair, im not expecting him to play a big role in our first team but the problem is....its a preseason friendly and he should be able to at least look like a professional footballer on the pitch and not some random kid who won prize at McDonalds to play few minutes with United. feck even Blackett looks decent and all the other kids are playing well and its just continued. He was pretty bad the whole last season in U21 and he did the same at Toulon where he even lost his place in the starting lineup....

15~~~
Yeh I can sort of understand what you mean but it's abit knee jerk based on two 45 min pre season games where everyone has looked abit out of sorts so it's not that fair to judge it's all on that. He also wasn't that bad for the 21s this year and I thought whenever I watched he looked like a class above that level similar to Januzaj as well. His issue as someone stated above is his struggle to fully adapt to the first team, where his hold up play is just not at the required level for us at the moment but that's pretty normal at 19

16~~~
I actually think we need to sign a striker and loan Wilson out. He looks like he needs game time to get himself used to senior football.

Few months in the championship would be ideal, bring him back in January and re-evaluate the situation.

17~~~
its not knee jerk as its more based on his performances at Toulon and U21 league last season....i watched every game that was on MUTV and there are maybe 2, 3 games where he looked class above, in the rest of he looked pretty average. I really like him and rate him very highly so thats the reason im critical.

18~~~
He in particular though has an opening in front of him.

Im just anxious for him to take this oppurtunity. Hopefully he doesn't let it pass him by.

19~~~
Haven't watched any of the preseason games yet so far but...has he really been that bad?

20~~~
im going over the top of course but he is playing pretty bad....probably the worst of all players on the tour.

21~~~
He does need a loan. With LVG giving Hernandez another chance and United signing the mystery striker, he's never going to get game time.

22~~~
If Januzaj hadn't have looked so bright under Moyesey people would probably say the same about him after a poor season last year. Wilson has plenty of time to show he is capable of making the step up like Januzaj did, but maintaining that level for inexperienced young players like him and Januzaj is difficult to do at a club like ours that demands so much, especially now with the level of competition the premier league has reached. We can't really afford to carry these younger players while they are out of form but if we can give them a few minutes off the bench mixed with the odd cup game its probably worth keeping them. Kane wasn't that inspiring on his loan spells either so its not always the be all and end all of a player.

23~~~
To be fair, he hasn't had much service. Januzaj was more of a striker in the first game than a 10, and Pereira wasn't really threatening with forward passes as the 10. Still, his control hasn't been good and he needs adjust his positioning to give himself better attacking opportunities. I wouldn't worry yet as he is really young.

24~~~
The frustrating thing was that in the first half we easily dominated the pitch and Depay and Mata were often turning with it only to find that Rooney didn't have the pace to make himself an option for a through ball. Wilson would have got so much service if he'd played that half instead of Rooney.

Then in the second, the creative players couldn't get on the ball in good areas anywhere near enough, and Wilson is too much of a pure #9 to be much use dropping deep to help out. If the strikers had played each other's halves, I reckon both would have had more success.

25~~~
Done no worse than Rooney up front.

26~~~
He's just not looked at the races, but then neither has Rooney. Dunno why.

I thought for sure that Wilson would score from Schweinsteiger's ball over the top last night. Reminded me of the one Fletch played to Chico on the 2011 tour, which ended in a Chico lob. He just wasn't alive to it.

27~~~
I really think he just needs a couple of goals to get his confidence going and he'll be fine. Pre-season doesn't mean a lot in the grand scheme of things. If he goes on loan he'll jump from club to club before being sold, as always happens with loaned players.

28~~~
Rooney was actually quite good in the game today I thought, he looked a lot sharper and his passing was much more on key. Just needs some goals to get going.

29~~~
Many players from top sides go out on loan, prove themselves and improve their games, and from that earn a spot in the first XI.

30~~~
I think eventually he'll explode with plenty of goals but theres no time period for that

31~~~
Rooney got better in the second game, Wilson got worse imo and I'm his fan.. needs to work on his hold up play and aerial duels, he is also outmuscled quite often.. needs time to develop, loan move in a championshio club would be good for him, not dure if he got game time in any club in premier league..

32~~~
Needs to go on loan, it's a risk but he isn't ready for the first team and he might struggle to get many games next season.

33~~~
think the biggest problem is that he doesnt know how to hold up the ball and how to win his duels......to clarify, lets take Januzaj as example. Outside of the pitch in non game situations, at tests and similar staff Wilson is probably much stronger then Adnan in almost everything but on the pitch is the opposite. Wilson looks like a kid and is pushed around with easy while Januzaj has a pretty good hold up play. They should really try to teach him how to use his body and his strength.

34~~~
In my opinion, the weaknesses you have highlighted aren't Wilson's real issue right now. United didn't play off the front man, and showed no intention of doing so in either half. I don't think Van Gaal's ideal is to play that way, so I'm not worried about how Wilson does physically. 

The main issue last night was Wilson's lack of anticipation. There were moments in the second half when the right run could've made a massive difference. I can remember Perreira getting the ball a few times and looking forward, but Wilson wasn't looking to make a run that he could feed. Wilson wasn't stretching the play much, he wasn't occupying the defenders or looking to exploit space. He just seemed a bit slow off the mark, like he was two second behind every ball aimed his way. Very different from how he was at QPR last season, for example. Maybe he's still warming up..?

35~~~
I think these will be always weaknesses but what you said about him not making enough runs does make sense too but in case we are under pressure unable to regain the ball for a longer period of time, it is pretty much useless striker to have, he needs to help too, if he can't use his body strength and ball covering than he should not play centrally IMO, these players are usually better to use of the wing.

He needs to work harder, he looks almost lazy at times and spot on with that always being 2 steps behind, when he accelerate he is pacey as feck but he almost looks as slow as mertesacker at times jogging on the pitch which kinda worries me the most, he is one of the players who need to regain fitness the most. ofcourse not everybody is as fit as Kane who can chase the ball for 90mins and still be able to keep composure and score a brace but perhaps it's the fitness issue for young Willo.

36~~~
Yeah, he needs a loan.

37~~~
The thing is, people are fairly mitigating that he is only 19 etc, which of course is very true. However, he just doesn't look ready to make a worthwhile impact at first-team level yet. He may be 19, but then so is Andreas Pereira. Players, even young players, must take their opportunities when it presents. Adnan did at 18, Andreas appears to be doing so at 19, just as Paddy did. I'm not a big fan of the caf culture to constantly offer excuses for players not playing well enough. I'm not saying Wilson is done at 19, but the fact is, he is out there for a reason and it is not unreasonable to expect even a young player to play well. He's fit, he is playing with quality footballers. The reality of the business is that he either does it when called upon, or he stops getting called upon. Young or not. He needs to start doing more than he has done if he wants to stay around the first-team here next season.

38~~~
I liked him out wide, I think he might get a few games there this season until he can strengthen his hold up play.

39~~~
winger?

40~~~
He can certainly shift. I'd like to see him given a chance this season.

41~~~
He's played winger in the youth (before converting) so it's no problem. We probably wanted to take the pressure off somewhat by putting him on the wing and letting him help us defend the lead. He didn't get much of the ball but he's very capable of being a hybrid winger/forward. I think he can get away more not being as strong on the wing - Adnan (if you believe the reports), worked hard over the summer and is stronger at the minute then Wilson. Against Barcelona Adnan did what hopefully Wilson will be able to in a season or so.

42~~~
Anders game mostly is in front of him. Wilsons on the last defender. In some respects it's easier looking forward because you can see what's coming, you can pass it and you're surrounded by more bodies so finding space (like anywhere is important). I don't think we played that many great through balls last season, to anyone. That might change with the midfield we have now.

43~~~
What to do with James? The fact is, counting him as one of our strikers this season is falsely beefing up the numbers in my opinion, he does not look ready to contribute anything significant here by a long way. That said, loan deals are also tricky too, and often do more harm than good. Also, U21 footy is of little use either, other than match-fitness perhaps.

44~~~
Keep him and play him.

We need to have faith in youngsters with this type of potential if they are to progress in to top class players.

45~~~
Loan him. He isn't good enough for the first team yet and needs a good amount of games in a competitive league.

46~~~
We did that last season, and IMO that was a mistake, he wasn't ready and he needs to play regularly. Loan him.

47~~~
He's 19 and will progress over the course of the season.If we keep him we should play to his strength, otherwise no point.

48~~~
The likes of Rooney, Falcao and RVP struggled in our system, I have no idea why Wilson wouldnt. It's best for him to get loaned to a lesser club where he gets opportunities to play football where the strikers get involved and score goals.

49~~~
Easy to forget he is still that young

50~~~
Little basis for that. I understand what you mean about showing faith in youngsters, but that works both ways. Andreas has earned more games, as did Adnan. Wilson has not.

51~~~
He barely got any significant time last season thanks to Falcao stinking up the place but getting time again and again.

52~~~
I like Wilson and hes a talent, but in some of the games he got (esp the FA cup) he was very poor, and rightly so didn't get on again.
He did however put in some good perfomances in the league and scored a few goals.
Its a shame Falcao was around as he would have got more time, but IMO at his age he needs to be playing every week and building his confidence at senior level, that is what is best for his development and we should send him on loan.
Even if its in the championship where he can get used to the more physical part of the game (where he seemed to struggle last year)

An example is Patrick Bamford who had a great season last year on loan.

53~~~
We'll have lot of games in the first half of the season with league cup, fa cup and CL group games so he will have plenty opportunity to get games.

I'd say we should keep him until at least Jan. By then he should have played a few games for us and we'll be in a better position to judge whether he should stay the remainder of the season or whether he should get 5 months regular football elsewhere.

54~~~
The issue here is that Januzaj looks like he's going to play as a striker...

55~~~
So that makes 3, arguably 4.

Unless one comes in we shouldn't be moving any on anyway.

56~~~
We have Rooney, Hernandez, Januzaj and then Wilson.
Maybe until Jan that is ok, but for me he needs to be playing games, regularly. That is going to be more benificial to him than playing for the U21 and then sitting on our bench.

57~~~
Why do you think it was a mistake? He got himself a few goals. 

He should have been playing ahead of Falcao last season. 

If he stays he will still have 2 or 3 strikers ahead of him. We will have options and also have the opportunity to give him experience in the cup matches.

58~~~
I'm just of the opinion that playing every week at senior level on loan will be more benificial to him than playing for the U21s and 6/7 cups and league games for us this season.

59~~~
We're not going to loan a 19 year old who's had as many injury problems as Wilson. We'll be keeping a watchful eye on him here and trying to find opportunities for him to play and learn.

60~~~
Not sure that he is ready for a loan yet. I don't think that there is a single EPL team who would play him regularly, more likely they would put an experienced old donkey upfront than give the chance to a very talented youngster.

I would say to keep him for an another season, give him 20 matches or so and then see how things will go.

61~~~
He's a peacock we gotta let him fly.

62~~~
Wouldn't expect any PL side to give him regular games, loads of Championship sides would. If another striker is brought in he should definitely be loaned.

63~~~
Off to West Brom apparently....

This is mental!

64~~~
What ? Loan or permanent ?

65~~~
Complete madness. It's like we are getting rid of any players who may posses a bit of pace

66~~~
Ridiculous. Hope it's bs, we can't possibly be that dumb <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

67~~~
Good I want to see him getting games! Loan please. U21 only playing 1 game a month, that is ridiculous!

68~~~
There must be someone else coming in. Surely. <i>Surely</i>.

69~~~
Wilson definitely isn't ready in fairness. Januzaj and Hernández are concerns but Wilson does genuinely need a loan.

70~~~
Berahino?

71~~~
So rooney is our only striker? 


Hahahahaha if this is true its so bad it's actually funny

72~~~
If both those latter players were still here I'd 100% agree... hell, if even one of them was here I would agree.

73~~~
Could probably be part of the Wilson loan? I don't know, we seem to have done some bit of business with them having sent Fletcher, Evans, Lindegaard and now Wilson on loan.

74~~~
So we'll have Rooney and Martial up top and that's it. You'd think Wilson would be perfect for a third option but apparently not. Strange this.

75~~~
You've got to think so. We were already looking thin up front - to let go Wilson, Januzaj and Hernandez and only bring in Martial would be mad

76~~~
I said Martial was wilsons replacement in the Martial thread, stand by that.

77~~~
It's too much pressure to put on his shoulders though. He showed that last season. I know any backup player is better than no backup player but it's likely harmful for his development. He's got a lot of potential and we need to give him games to realise that. He just can't get that here. There's too much pressure on the striker to perform for a striker of his age. It's the same reason Rossi left.

78~~~
I'm genuinely starting to believe Kane's coming. I need to lie down.

79~~~
Great loan move. Clearly not currently up to playing for us yet, and needs football with less pressure.

Of course, in the current soap episode of Manchester United Are Clueless - it will be seen as a joke that we are allowing Messi out on loan.

80~~~
Some rumours the West Brom move might be permanent.

81~~~
I agree, but then the issue is that all we have is Wayne Rooney and lad who is the same age as Wilson, but with the added pressure of having a £37m price tag on his head.

It'll be a great move for him, but it just leaves us incredible bare. Can only think someone else must be coming in.

82~~~
That has to be nonsense. There's no way we're this stupid.

83~~~
what the heck is it with us and West Brom?

Fletcher, Evans, Lindegard and now Wilson?

84~~~
so who the heck are VP, Falcao and Hernandez replacements?

85~~~
People need to stop saying this. By now I'm convinced the higher ups are locked up in some drug madness getting rid of players just because they can.

86~~~
what?

87~~~
sorry....Lindegaard. happy?

88~~~
Haha thanks, I almost had a heartattack, I thought they took Jessie too!

89~~~
because of that 20min display he got v Swansea on the opening day last season?
He's faded into oblivion hasn't he?

90~~~
No I like him, hes a decent player. Would like him to get a PL loan. You know some of us do watch are young players in the reserves, whilst they are on loan or when the play for england u21s

91~~~
Just made his debut for Englands U21's.

92~~~
Just scored <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

93~~~
Scores

94~~~
Nice!

95~~~
Easy little tap in that...

96~~~
Any gifs of goal. Pleased for him!

97~~~
Pleased for the lad. Did he seem delighted or careless and have chewing gum in his mouth like against Arsenal.

98~~~
Made one great through pass too after coming on. Should have had a assist too probably.

99~~~

100~~~

101~~~
Love this lad!

102~~~
Get him on our bench.

103~~~
Southgate said in the post match interview he was a work in progress. Needs filling out more and deal with the physical stuff better but he is a real goalscorer.

104~~~
Yeah he doesn't look physically ready at times. Some pass that though.

105~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsfynFlkCSQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

106~~~
Wilson will be our RW the season after this.

107~~~
Excellent. Well done, Wilson! The pass was wonderfully well-weighted.

108~~~
Memphis-------Martial----Wilson/Januzaj
------------Pereira/Januzaj----------------
----------Herrera---------------------------
--------------------Schneiderlin------------
Shaw-------------------------------Darmian
-----------LCB-------Smalling--------------
-----------------GK-------------------------

We have pretty damn good options everywhere for players under 26, except at LCB and GK (assuming De Gea leaves).

109~~~
Wilson would be a waste at RW.

Anyway, he might not be LVG left footed LCB but Jones at CB alongside smalling is pretty good.

Guess, could put Johnstone at GK if not De Gea.

110~~~
The lad is a goalscorer, not a winger.

111~~~
He'd be good on the left of a front three though. Could be our own version of Thierry Henry. He did most of his best work from the left.

112~~~
Lad needs to go out on loan this season, he needs to gain more experience than the odd game here & there (probably not in preferred position) at United. I think a Championship loan would toughen him up, ready for a Premiership loan next season, then he'd be ready to compete for a starting role, with whoever is here 17/18 season. Would hate to see him sold as he's just not getting enough game time.

113~~~
If he keeps scoring at u21 levels, sooner or later he will get a good run of games in senior team for club. He has to get some games somewhere anyway this season as we don't have enough players to rotate in 4 competitions. Just hoping he takes those chances to impress LvG and maybe push for starts in PL too. I think he is kind of player LvG would like. It is just about LvG having enough confidence about Wilson leading line when stakes are high.

114~~~
The championship is a tough, tough division. Its very physical and wouldn't play to Wilsons strengths at all. I think he's better to stay with us and gradually learn through reserve games while he still beefs up. When he gets to Januzajs age (who has arguably bulked up alot) he will be more suited to a loan then i feel. It's either that or league 1 in my opinion but that would be a big drop down for a player of his caliber. Reputation wise i think he's more established then that but coming up against championship style defending could ruin his confidence i think. He's not built like Bamford who was able to hold his own physically as an example. Id rather he get carling cup minutes and the odd appearance off the bench whilst benefiting from training with the first team.

115~~~
I doubt we'll loan him out. He can play as a wide forward. It's better for him to get used to playing with the United players and he'll be fine once he finds his feet. He's back scoring goals which is good and that'll give him confidence. We've a very young team potentially so i'm sure they'll be a great team spirit.

116~~~
His development was a bit weird to me past year. He stagnated a lot and he had decent number of chances to prove himself. He failed to do that, always looked like he can last only 40mins or so... big problem is also his holdup play being below average, his aerial abilities are poor too. So yeah maybe use him as a wide forward

117~~~
Memphis-Wilson-Martial

The lineup is inexperienced but oozes pace and fluid movement we need badly. I hope LvG will try that in the Cups at least.

118~~~
Yes he could play either side of an attacking three though I don't think that is optimal personally.

119~~~
If Martial is going to drift left a lot, then Wilson at RWF in the sort of role Cavani plays for PSG makes sense:

--------Martial---------------
--------------------Wilson---
Memphis--------------------

with Memphis looking to come infield, Martial looking to drift left and Wilson looking to just go straight vertically toward goal.

120~~~
I'd rather him stay here than go on loan to a Championship club. I think he would've got games at say Bournemouth for example, Wilson and Wilson up front.

121~~~
A telepathic understanding as good as Yorke and Cole I reckon<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

122~~~
So am I correct in thinking he didn't go on loan in the end?

If our striking options weren't so thin West Brom could've been a good move for him. But with Hernandez' exit and Januzaj's loan clearly leaving game-time begging up front, there's definitely an opportunity for him here.

123~~~
Easy to forget how young he still is.  That was his U21 <b>debut </b>he scored on!

We're not really going to have much option but to have him on the bench a lot this season, and probably starting a few matches too, given the striker exodus.  So LVG must be seeing something pretty decent in training to have that faith.

124~~~
Not strong enough to handle the premier league every week from the start, but he's a good option from the bench when we are chasing a goal.

He's going to be a very good striker in a few years, I'm glad we've kept hold of him. There was talk that he might want away permanently this summer due to a lack of game time.

Both him and Martial seem like 9 and a halves, both comfortable up top/ dropping deeper and moving to wide positions. It will be interesting to see if they can play together!

125~~~
he is strong enough he just doesnt know how to use his body, when and if he learns that we will have a top striker in our hands.

126~~~
I think he's even more useful when guarding a lead. A good out-ball and pacey for the counter attacks.

127~~~
Article by Norcroft that the Caf retweeted cites van Gaal as 'unconvinced by James Wilson'. Well...

128~~~
Henry was right footed and enjoyed cutting in from the left and finishing with his right foot.

Also, Henry always performed the best while starting from a central position - and drifting wide left as he pleased and as the space opened up for him.

The equivalent for Wilson would be playing on the right, surely? I can't imagine he'd excel while tasked with getting past his man and whipping it into the box...

129~~~
Wilson has impressed me at reserve level more than Welbeck and even Will Keane. I'm convinced he can make it here, and I can't see how reports of LvG not rating him are true. True, he needs to bulk up a bit, but at the same time he had such speed, agility and balance, and a hell of a left foot. Wilson should have been getting the game time Falcao was gifted last season.

130~~~
At the end of the day a squad position has opened up. Who knows if it will go to Perreira or Wilson or who will grab their chance.

131~~~
He started him against Liverpool at home last year I think. Would be a strange thing to do if he didn't rate him. Though he has definitely fallen away a bit this season it seems, who who really knows.

132~~~
Exactly, also came on and finished the game off at QPR, which we were lacking all season. Usually we'd sit at 1-0 and shit our pants for the next half an hour. I'm pretty sure he does rate him.

133~~~
The only thing I'm really taking from the fact we moved Januzaj etc is that hopefully that will open the door for Pereira in some capacity. Wilson will get chances this year now to, although I'm still not sure about him at the top level just yet.

134~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he got less game time now more than ever with the new formation, with that being 1 striking spot my guess is he is last in the pecking order. 

We should loan him out next season if we get in a new striker, he's potential is frightening.

135~~~
Disagree completely. I was disappointed that he didn't manage to show his true colours in the first team but he's had a really tough 12months with injuries. Hopefully when he stops growing we'll see a lot of the niggily injuries that have plagued him disappear.

His hold up play and aerial ability are both fine imo as well.

136~~~
Derby want him according to Sky.

137~~~
When does the emergency loan window close? , it would be just madness to loan him to a Championship club but we seem to like a bit of madness. Just checked and it actually opens tomorrow and will close in November, really hope we don't send him out on loan or there will be a lot of Fellaini upfront this season.

138~~~
He was fine with injuries last year but needs to grow up from it, you're right.. I'm personally worried about his ankles.

And his hold up play and aerial ability are defo his biggest weaknesses, he himself stated it in an interview but you can really tell from watching him play it's just hardly enough for top tier football, for his holdup play it's crucial to cover the ball better but it will come with time, he' very easy pushed from the ball. I'd say that for example Januzaj's hold up play is better than Wilson's and he's not striker.. as for the aerial ability, never seen a striker mistiming so many jumps but he's learning..

139~~~
He's also got Martial as competition now too. I sure hope he doesn't go out on loan to the Championship.

140~~~

141~~~
feck sake...

142~~~
fecking brilliant, let's send all our young players on loan and sell all the old strikers.

143~~~
We can recall him, what's the big deal?

144~~~
Leaves us with Rooney and Martial for the #9 and that's it? Is he taking the piss or what the feck?

At least it somewhat confirms that Martial will play #9.

145~~~
I think it makes sense. I think he'll develop far more with regular games. That is, provided we don't send him somewhere he won't play.

146~~~
Is he gone to Derby or is it a different club?

147~~~
I am all for getting good loans for the kids but then we should have kept Chicharito as backup. We have one striker right now who hasn't played well at the start of the season and he has zero competition in the squad for his place. Martial is also a kid who has never played in this league and has completed 90 minutes in only 9 games in his career. The recall option only provides security in case of long term absence but if Rooney gets injured in training on Thursday Friday then we have nothing. All this sadly points to the fact that he will have Fellaini as a striker and we will just lump it to him at the end of games.

148~~~
and where is he going to btw?

149~~~
And Fellaini obviously.

150~~~
When was he really going to play if everybody is fit? He'd perhaps make the squad every once in a while and get a couple of cup games. Perhaps it is better to give him regular playing time at this point. If a spot opens up for him (due to injury) he'll be recalled.

151~~~
Wilson needs regular senior football now and we have the recall option. Rooney, Fellaini, Memphis and Martial would all be ahead of him currently in the eyes of Van Gaal for the striker position.

152~~~

153~~~
What are their other strikers like? Would he be a starter?

154~~~
If he's not going there to start every fecking game it's a waste of time.

155~~~
Darren Bent and Chris Martin there.

Doesn't seem the best loan we have chosen considering the massive interest that there was in him.

156~~~
Wilson is a proper goal scorer and I was hoping to see him on the bench as an option to change games. I get that there is a need to move on from Saf but having grown up in an era where the best plan when we trailed was to throw all the strikers on to now those last 20 minutes at Swansea(with Fellaini and Carrick coming on)  makes me feel pathetic

157~~~
He definitely needs game time so Derby or Hull would be fine as long as he plays.

158~~~
Well Derby have only scored 4 goals in 5 games so he should get games for sure

159~~~
Wasn't there solid interest from PL teams just a couple days before deadline day? Derby hardly seems like a solid, stable club to loan to.

160~~~
Yeah but you can't recall them anytime like when you loan players to Championship.  I guess Wilson will only be loaned for 1-2 months.. Hopefully he will bang in goals and then be back sooner <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

161~~~
We are somewhat thick. Leaving ourselves with one senior striker who has been awfully out of form for a while and a new signing as the only two options for striker position is absurd. Why don't we send Martial and Herrera on loan while we are at it, so we have no options whatsoever for front 4 aside from first choice players?

162~~~
Chris Martin is crap so he'll be ahead of him.

Good move if true. People will say it's mad that we are leaving ourselves short, but LvG would probably play Fellaini as a #9 rather than start Wilson if he had too.

163~~~
if we can recall him anytime ts a great deal....

164~~~
What would be REALLY stupid is ruining a young promising player's chances of making it by keeping them around to play a few minutes here or there.

The under 21s are a waste of time. Players like Wilson, Januzaj and McNair need to play regularly or they will never develop.

165~~~
They have Weimann and Bent too tbf.

Probably prefer adding other areas.

166~~~
But with chicharito gone surely Wilson could have gotten good game time as the 3rd choice striker or out wide behind Mata, no?

167~~~
I don't see him getting much game time (not enough to develop as a player, anyway) unless we get a serious injury - and it sounds like if we do, we can recall him.

I think we should be looking for a similar arrangement for McNair.

168~~~
He is one of the two strikers at the club who has actually been here for more than two weeks. Even if he goes behind Martial (and he likely could) he would still be third choice with both of his competitors bound to be used in different positions (Rooney is basically our second/third #10 and Martial is one of 4 wide players). We will be playing in 4 competitions this season and hopefully have 50+ games to play - if we cannot find games for him or Januzaj we may as well give up.

I'm not sure going out on loan to Championship will bring him that many benefits. He needs top level football.

169~~~
Finding a few games here and there is not (remotely) enough, that's the point. If we need him, we can recall him. The idea that you need three players for a position is just silly.

Not so sure Derby is a great move, though (nor Dortmund for Januzaj). All depends on their time on the pitch. Both clubs at a decent level, at least.

170~~~
Did this loan actually go through? 

If so, he needs recalled asap and given a chance. Fellaini shouldn't be considered for striker anymore, and we can't rely on just Marcial and Rooney up top.

171~~~
Agreed, Rooney's injury and the total failure of the 'start Fellaini up front' experiment makes it pretty clear that we should keep him around. To be honest regardless of price tag I rate him as equal to Martial in terms of promise and experience at the moment. Keep them both around. Hell, <i>start</i> them both. Imagine the pace of that attack!

172~~~
He needs a loan, Rooney's injury wasn't that bad so he will soon be back, Wilson would be third choice, he needs game time.

173~~~
I think Wilson would have finished that mignolet error that led to a chance for fellaini. He is accurate when he gets a shot.

174~~~
Experience? Martial has played nearly 50 games for Monaco including big CL ties with Arsenal and Juve. Talent-wise is subjective obviously but Martial has performed well in big games as a starter already, Wilson has had a handful of sub appearances and a couple of starts at senior level.

175~~~
If Rooney is going to be back soon then he should go on loan. He is incredibly raw and struggles against physical defenders who sit deep. He isn't going to get better in these areas just training. He has all the abilities to deal with it and just needs the experience now to get used to senior football.

176~~~
So Martial's had about a season's worth more games. But Wilson's been training with United's first team for more than a season already and has played games in the Premier League, so his familiarity with the team and the football probably comes pretty close to balancing that out. I'm not saying they're identical, just that we can basically treat them as being in about the same place in their careers and development, regardless of the fact that Wilson came from our academy for free and Martial came for a massively inflated fee.

177~~~
What is it that makes a lot of United fans believe this kid has a bright future here? I don't follow the youth team and I'm sure he's looked very promising there but so have a shitload of other players before him who turned to nothing. Besides being quick, he's shown absolutely nothing at senior level so far. Looks extremely ordinary for me and people who say he's on the same level as Martial in terms of potential - I sure hope not because then those 36 million look even more crazy.

Obviously I hope I'm wrong but I really don't see what has gotten people so excited.

178~~~
A goal every 155 minutes is absolutely nothing?

179~~~
A season full of regular top flight senior football and 2 CL ties against huge clubs like Arsenal and Juve I would say puts him comfortably ahead in terms of experience in important games where you are playing as the main forward, he's shown he can cope with that both mentally and physically. Bar the Hull debut Wilson has barely started and has made very little impact in his sub appearances, I'd say he's got a lot still to learn which is why he'll go on loan and Martial will likely start on Tuesday as he's much closer to being ready to be a main player at United at this point in time.

180~~~
He's very skillful and has great balance on the ball, he's quick and he's a very good finisher. 

Absolutely no idea what level he'll make it at as it's just potential, but I'd rather him than Fellaini up front even if he isn't good enough. Fellaini has no attributes to make him useful as a striker so playing him there ahead of anyone in our squad who is a striker is incredibly stupid. It's saying to Wilson that he isn't going to get on the pitch no matter what.

181~~~
That's down to one game with little at stake.

182~~~
He's scored a shed load of goals at the reserve level and he's hardly been offered a chance in the first team. Then there is this:


Even considering the fact that he's young and inexperienced, he's a natural as a striker, something Fellaini is not. Plus, he's about the only other option we have on the books at the moment.

183~~~
It's not that I'd rather we play Fellaini than Wilson. None of them are near good enough to be second-choice striker at United in my opinion. I can't believe we've allowed that to happen. I'd take Adebayor on a free at this point.

184~~~
He didn't score 4 goals in one game. Of course he is going to do absolutely nothing if you just conveniently discount everything he does.

185~~~
Wilson should be playing football somewhere. If Van Gaal rates him as below Fellaini in the striker pecking order, he should send him on loan. What's the point in him being in the squad if Van Gaal is going to play random completely unsuited players in his position ahead of him?

I'm not sure how WIlson would have made himself more useless than Fellaini anyway...in fact Wilson played against Liverpool last year and was better despite the fact he didn't do anything other than make runs.

I agree neither should be second choice. Regardless of how good he is or isn't, Wilson isn't experienced enough for that. Fellaini shouldn't be used as a striker anymore than he should be used as a goalkeeper.

186~~~
Won't be here in a few years I'm certain. He's very overrated by a fair few on here

187~~~
Bit early to write of a 19 year old kid isn't it?

I think he is a gem, but really in need of a loan, the U21's is way too easy for him.

188~~~
He's the best striker I've seen come through the academy in the past 20 years. He's at the stage of development which can be the hardest for the club and player to manage where he's too good for under 21s football but not quite ready to be a first team regular.The main thing he needs to work on is finding space and getting more involved in the game against senior players because he definitely has the ability. Aside from being just quick he's a very good dribbler, has a very powerful and accurate shot from anywhere around the box and is 1 of the coolest 1 on 1 finishers I've seen in such a young player. Obviously he has to transfer it to senior football as with all young players but he has a huge amount of talent. There's a video here which shows all of his goals from the 2013/14 season which shows what an array of different types of goals he's capable of <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2014/May/James-Wilson-Manchester-United-201314-goals-compilation.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...nchester-United-201314-goals-compilation.aspx</a>

189~~~
I think that's premature, but I do agree that he has it all to prove that he has a future at the top level. Right now, he's just another player who has looked very good at reserve level. At first team level he's looked no United player. Nothing wrong with that, as he's only young - but the fact is, he still has to look a United player and until then, who knows.

190~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>

I just think he's destined to become a midtable striker much like cleverly (yes he's a midfielder but same principle)  he will do a decent job at Everton or a team similar to them but United is too big for him.

191~~~
Those who believe in him are the ones who frequent the youth forum and are more likely to have watched him a fair bit. I'm in the same boat. Knew it wouldn't happen but I wanted him to start yesterday with Fellaini behind. 

I feel like he's got bags of potential and I'd love him to be given chances this season but it looks unlikely that he will here, in which case, for the sake of his development he'd be best going out on loan.

192~~~
What a lot of shit, you clearly haven't seen him enough, he looks a class above when playing for the U21's, also to <a class="username" data-user="34127, @Jev" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34127/">@Jev</a> he's hardly had any opportunity at Senior level so how we can judge him there is ridiculous, I believe he will turn good if given a chance, I hate how some people on here just write young players off before they even get a run of games, were all crying out for pace and hunger in the players but were never playing those young hungry players, we desperately need to put trust in Wilson,Periera,Lingard,Januzaj etc and stop playing an out of form Rooney or bloody Fellaini as a #9, jaysus

193~~~
I still think he's going to be an absolute star. Just needs to bulk up, and get some playing time.

194~~~
Slightly surprised by that. You rate him higher than Rossi when he was in our academy and reserves? Rossi is the best youngster I have seen 

The other thing is that we hadn't really been producing any strikers till Welbeck. ( maybe Rossi before that).

195~~~
He's more exciting player to watch than Rossi.

196~~~
Disagree. Rossi was magic. Wilson is all about pace at the moment. Needs to add the other parts to his game.

197~~~
Wilson has more to his game than just pace.

198~~~
His main problem in PL games from what I've seen is he's too lightweight. He's a front man so if centrebacks can just brush him away from the ball he's always going to struggle to impact on games. So I don't think you'll really see whether he can make it as a PL striker until he fills out and is in his early twenties.

I take it the people willing to write him off have just never watched him aside from in the first team? I'm not saying he'll make it at United as you have to be pretty near the top bracket to do that, but he has plenty of ability to be worth giving some time. He's a 19 year old who's barely started a game and has 4 goals for Manchester United, that's not exactly write off material. That sort of decision doesn't have to be made for another two or three years.

199~~~
I don't know if there would be a better time to give him a look. Fellaini is completely out of his comfort level and being played in direct opposition to his strengths when put in as striker. At no point in that role did he look comfortable or even remotely effective yesterday. Playing him there is a waste. So that leaves us with just Marcial able to effectively play in the 9 role when Rooney isn't fit? 

We're still in all competitions at this point and our main striker is a 13 year veteran of the league, and prone to occasional bouts on the treatment table. We have a converted midfielder with no genuine striker ability and a 19 year old who's played 25 minutes in the league as backup. Wilson should at least be getting a sniff under these circumstances.

200~~~
While i rate Wilson very highly, Gotta disagree with this.

Rossi was excellent to watch and involved throughout the game more.

201~~~
It's really hard to explain if you haven't watched him. You can tick off his qualities, which on paper are pretty much a full set for a striker like him: he's fast, has great balance and good strength; he's a lethal finisher, both in terms of being able to score all sorts of goals (long-range rockets, deft headers, flicks in the box, clinical ten-yarners etc) and having that knack of being composed and clinical when chances fall to him; he loves to make runs in behind and has excellent timing on the shoulder; he's also good with the ball, has scored a handful of stunning dribbling goals and throughout his youth career has always been involved in the build-up play alongside teammates like Januzaj, Pereira, Daehli etc; he's a hard-worker, and likes to defend from the front; his decision making is mature and reliable, which in combination with his pace is what makes him such a good counter-attacker; he's actually got good passing range, although obviously you don't really want him involved early enough in the move to have to show it. But see his near-assist for the England U21s vs the USA recently as an example of his eye for a defence-splitting pass.

He's also just got that x-factor, which you develop an eye for if you watch a lot of youth football. For me, the likes of Welbeck, Macheda et al never had it - they were special players in the reserves, and certainly had their moments as senior players (I'm still a massive Welbeck fan tbh), but I would never have put a load of money on either making it with us. For what it's worth, I think Pereira's a superb footballer but I don't see it in him either, he still doesn't <i>seize</i> matches despite his absurd technical ability. The only three PL youth players I've really seen it in since a young Wayne Rooney are Wilshere, Pogba and Januzaj.

But as you say, lots of fans of youth football claim to see 'that x-factor' in lots of young footballers, so it's hard to take someone else's word on that. What <i>really</i> sets Wilson particularly apart for me is the sheer relentlessness with which he has scored goals at every single level. Trust me, even the good strikers just don't do it that much in the English youth leagues. It's hard for either teams or players to be consistently prolific because of the stop-start, chop-and-change nature of the football, and because of the regrettably low-intensity matches that you sometimes (not always, but sometimes) see at those levels.

But from U16 level onwards, in terms of goalscoring Wilson has just looked like a senior player amongst kids. In periods where we've been the best around and thrashed plenty of opponents, he's had several 4- and 5- goal games. In periods where we haven't looked that handy, he's still popped up with a goal a game, and a handful of hatricks. He's particularly notable for scoring in the really big ones, and when it really matters. He scored all four goals against City in a crucial 4-0 win two seasons ago - a game where we weren't really even the better team, believe it or not - and then scored the key opening goal in the same fixture this season to effectively guarantee us the title.

Before we bought him the only full matches I'd seen from Martial were the Juve and Arsenal games. Since, I've obviously watched a daft amount of highlights footage. He's gifted, but in a load of videos which are designed to show his very best moments, I've seen nothing which I wouldn't not only feel Wilson to be capable of, but expect Wilson to produce as a matter of course.

And let's not act as if he's really been given opportunities with the first team yet. Giggs gave him game time and he scored a brace in his debut. Since then it's been a handful of sub appearances for a team that was all over the place last season, whilst Falcao got game after game after game despite showing no sign of being able to score goals.

In <i>this</i> team, with a very solid-looking defence, an embarrassment of midfield (both DM and AM) riches and an obvious strategic foundation to build on -a team that has every ingredient, really, except a fast, direct, running striker to score the goals - Wilson would score <i>at the very least</i> a goal every two games if he was playing regularly. More than that if he was first choice. You can scoff, but I'm the one who's actually watched him. This is a special, special young striker.

202~~~
I can understand people who are writing him off because he really looks very poor at senior level and if you only watched him there he looks very average. He obviously isnt ready for the step up, the biggest and the only problem for me is that he struggles on the physical side of the game, defenders are pushing him like some random kid from the street and his confidence after that is very low so he struggles to show his other qualities, and there are plenty of them.
He isnt weak, he just doesnt know how to use his body and his strength. When and if he learns that we will have a top striker in our hands im certain. The lad has everything. Fantastic dribbling ability, balance, touch, movement and finishing skills. In his best season at U21 two years ago he was playing in the team that was creating even less chances then our first team is today but he was scoring for fun and he was scoring all sorts of goals.
He lost his mojo in the meantime so loan to the top side in the championship would be the best. He would get the chance to play for the dominant team, would gain match fitness and experience and hopefully he would starting to look like the old self. Much better then the loan to the struggling EPL side. Of course with out striker situation the recall option is a must.

PS: Rossi <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> What a player he was, the best youth player i watched after Ravel. Pure class, shame about the injuries.....

203~~~
I rated Rossi extremely highly as well but yeah I do rate Wilson higher purely based on their under age performances because I think the general level of underage football has improved a lot in the past 10 years and that Wilson is doing it against better players and I think if Wilson develops physically he can be an all round forward but that's just my opinion and I can see reasons why many would rate Rossi higher.

204~~~
The two youth players who I was 100% certain would be great players at United. And by far the two most entertaining youth players I've seen at United. Ravel could have been anything he wanted to be but is throwing it away. Rossi has just been incredibly unlucky with injuries. Both would be stars here if things had just gone slightly differently.

205~~~
Does he?

The lad started <i>two league games </i>last season. He also started in two reserve-heavy FA Cup ties. The rest of his handful of appearances were off the bench for ten or fifteen minutes at the end.

You wouldn't even expect an established quality senior player to do anything with that sort of game time. Based on such limited chances, I'd say it's actually impressive that he's shown what he has. Obviously there is infinitely more to come when he gets an actual opportunity.

206~~~
Of course. But from an entertainment standpoint his pace is what makes him exciting, hence my point. Rossi was a very complete footballer at that age. He was extremely creative as well as being a goal machine. 

On a more general note regarding Wilson, he has many good qualities but he is still very much a work in progress. He needs to learn to protect the ball better, get involved in all parts of the game etc. He's almost a victim of being too fast and too good at youth level that he hasn't had to develop a fully rounded game yet. He's just been able to blow people away with pace and finishing. 

IMO he badly needs a loan to give him time to work on the other aspects of his game. It might take two full seasons until he's ready to do it for United. However I think it could be worth the wait because his pace, finishing and poachers instinct are seriously impressive. He could be really special.

207~~~
I'm a huge fan of Wilson but yes he has looked pretty average at first team level. He's been anonymous in most of the games he's played. I can see why those who are not familiar with him haven't been overly impressed. 

That's not to say he won't be a brilliant player because his talent is amazing. He just needs a bit more time and experience before he will be ready for United. A season on loan playing every week would be ideal for his development.

208~~~
yes he does, i love him and rate him very highly but he doesnt look special(and he is) yet at senior level. The debut was good and cameo against QPR was good but other then that he looked very average. I dont expect that he score goals on regular basis as a sub or something but he was pushed around like a kid 90% of his time on the pitch, his touch was okay, he rarely dribbled and he wasnt able to get himself into the game. The movement was poor and to be fair to him the teammates didnt really want to pass him the ball most of the time.

209~~~
Am in the should-go-on-loan camp. He needs it to improve. If we need a 19 year old striker to deputise for Rooney, then Martial is the better bet this season.

210~~~
I don't think that anyone is arguing that Wilson's fully developed or even 100% ready for a place in the 1st team week in and week out because of merit. Under the circumstances though, he surely can't be any worse of a selection than using Fellaini up front. 
.

211~~~
Agree with the others. I like Wilson a lot too but Rossi was magic. 

His touch and technique were beautiful. He had decent pace and his finishing was very very good. His career has been hampered by injuries but imo he was the best youngster at our club. I rate him higher than Ravel. Ravel is probably the most naturally gifted player  to come thru our ranks but Rossi did so much more on the pitch.

212~~~
That's exactly what I came here to post. We can argue about his qualities & talent, but right now there is a golden opportunity to give him minutes and see what he's capable of. Like Pogba, again we choose cover from an out of position senior player instead of letting a reserve/youth player on the verge of first team minutes have a shot. If not against Liverpool, at least a few starts in the upcoming run of fixtures.

213~~~
Rossi never be able to score these goals whereby he just ran through everyone from the middle of the pitch like Wilson did.Hence my opinion.

214~~~
Our future RW.

215~~~
He's going to be huge when he's older. Just looking at his frame, it's obvious that there's much to come for him physically. But at the moment he gets bullied out of games far too easily. Most of his recent performances have gone the same way. I don't expect him to make a mark until he fills out, which could still be a couple of years from now. I hope he's taking this break from action to try and bulk himself up.

216~~~
Wilson is an incredible player, he will be a star for us if managed correctly, everyone at the club knows that, he is a proper Manchester United player.

217~~~
Needs a loan for this season. Unless we are reverting back to 442, then there is not much need for him. He needs to go to a decent championship club where he will be the first name on the team sheet.

218~~~
He's got all the tools to make it, but seems to have struggled under LvG's system (similar to Januzaj). I still hope he can makes it though. It's a real dilemma for him now, his age is almost identical to Martial, and similar qualities too, just that Martial is that bit advanced in his development. Rather than sending him out on loan, maybe we should quit the Fellaini experiment, push Martial to 2nd choice, and give the remaining playing time to Wilson. He can't do worse than Fellaini, can he?

219~~~
He is in the squad for the PSV game.

220~~~
How much have you actually seen of him for the youth teams?

221~~~
Martial to United was probably the best thing that could have happen to Wilson. 

It forced LvG to make a decision about his future. The idea to send him on loan to a Championship club was a sensible decision but then Rooney got injuried, Fellaini didn't exactly impresse in his new role and suddenly there was a place for him in the squad. 

Further on I think both these two young talents can benefit from each other. They both have plenty of pace and are accurate and distinct in front of goal. 

IMO Wilson needs to mature a little bit more, both physically and mentally. And like any young talent he needs to play regularly and have a little bit of luck.

222~~~
Wilson can also play as a wide forward so he could come in handy. He just needs to work on his strength and then do what comes naturally. The goal Martial scored is what Wilson can do and so the futures very positive. We just need to remember how young he is. What will help him I think is we've quite a young squad, so he'll be getting plenty of support.

I think the dynamic still have to be right though. We can't expect forwards to make runs and ignore them. So Wilson, Martial - all rely on the team playing at a good tempo and looking to get the ball forward

223~~~
He needs a loan. He needs to learn to impose himself in a good adult league. He wont do that in the youth teams and based on last season he is still too weak/timid to do it in the Premier League. With Martial's arrival he wont get enough chances anyway.

So pleased. With Rooney out, Wilson and Martial are without question the only two players who should be options up front against PSV. And in the circumstances neither should have to play a full 90 minutes in a game like this just yet, so it makes perfect sense to have Wilson on the bench and Martial starting.

I'll be so pissed if we end up starting Depay or, god forbid, Young up front. If it's Fellaini again I might just lose all faith in LVG.

225~~~
Hoped he might get on the bench since we don't have a single striker there.

226~~~
Big fella is classed as a striker now

227~~~
I thought that had been knocked squarely on the bemoppled head after that first half agaisnt Liverpool.

228~~~

Lets hope he is staying. We need the lad.

229~~~
Wtf is LVG doing with him ?

Keep him around but he doesn't get in the squad when the only attacking option off the bench is fecking Fellaini.


Could definitely have used him vs PSV considering he was around anyway. And if he isn't going to use him anyway, better to loan him.

230~~~
I want to see a front 3 of Memphis Martial Wilson. Might be just the alcohol in me though.

231~~~
I would love it with LVG trust him the way Pochetino did with Kane. It's quite simple, the more games he play, the more he will learn. Memphis, Martial and Wilson would be fast and deadly. This could be tried in the upcoming league cup game.

Plus LVG should start trusting him over Fellaini.

232~~~
Too inexperienced. Unless we play mata, herrera and schweiny behind them.

Memphis....Martial....Wilson
.............Mata......Herrera.......
................Schweiny................
...............Back Four................

Bit unbalanced but will definitely be exciting to see in my opinion.

233~~~
I'd want to see this!

234~~~
vs. Ipswich?

235~~~
Morgan + Herrera @ CM

Wouldn't mind seeing Lingard and Goss come on off the bench.

236~~~
Don't we just want to try and win this competition?  Have you forgotten MK Dons already?

237~~~
MK Donz was more due to the defense's inexperience along with a midfield of Anderson and Nick Powell.

238~~~
against Dons played shit youngsters, this are the quality ones....

239~~~
The side that played against MK Dons is almost all gone. Most of that team was senior players on the periphery and some youth players filling roles. A front four of our most exciting youth prospects behind a strong midfield basis and defence will be fine.

Coincidentally, Andreas and Wilson were the two subbed on who actually did rather well for themselves that match.

240~~~
Nah. Kids + league cup 4eva

241~~~
Memphis so far in the EPL has been shite, Martial has played a few minutes in the EPL and Wilson apart from a couple of games has the look of a lad who is not ready for it.
Conclusion= You are pissed.

242~~~
They'll get there. With young players it just takes a spark. I'm confident about Memphis and Martial if they're our future we could do a hell of a lot worse.

243~~~
Nev seemed baffled by what is going on with Wilson, the fact he can't even make a bench that doesn't have a single striker option on it.

244~~~
LVG thinks fellaini is a striker now.

btw hope to see him starting in midweek.

245~~~
I would have thought the notion of Fellaini as a striker died in the Liverpool game. Maybe Wilson is not applying himself well enough in training or something, but it seems odd that we cancelled his loan if we don't intend to get him involved.

Me too, Wilson and Pereira will hopefully be starting on Wednesday.

246~~~
Agreed. He played the full 90 today so doesn't seem he would be starting vs fecking Ipswich either.

247~~~

248~~~
It's a long season ahead of us and even if the Fellaini experiment continues, I can see Wilson getting his opportunities eventually, simply because Martial is still a kid and will need to be rested. If I was to hazard a guess, it'll be around the Xmas period when we see Wilson in the first team, with all those games coming in thick and fast.

249~~~
He doesn't need a game here and there, he needs to play regular football in a more competitive league than the U21's. 

At the moment he is not even on the bench.

250~~~
People overestimate the concept of loans, it's something that usually sounds great but practically it is very rare for a young player who went out from a top club to make it at the club. I have nothing against sending Wilson out on loan but look at the example of Bamford who had a pretty successful Championship loan last season and has played 16 minutes on loan at Palace this season. The premier league clubs have far too much money and so obviously they aren't bothered about youth products of other clubs while you have to consider a lot of factors for Championship clubs. Maybe the people at United feel that rather than playing in the championship he would be better off building himself up at United

251~~~
Martial could be the best thing that ever happened to Wilson because they're not too dissimilar. I thought he might be subbed for the cup game but the under 21's haven't played that many games so it might not matter. I think he'll be on the bench against Ipswich.

252~~~
If you have absolutely no chance of making it into the first team at your parent club. You're to far out to get regular appearances (also factor in the bizarro world subs Van Gaal likes to utilize) off the bench then a loan move is important if you get a chance to fight for their first team and make regular appearances. Sometimes just to get out on loan and experience first team football in the young lads case.

I think Van Gaal has said in the past that they simply don't play enough youth games to make the system viable for developing talent.

253~~~
Peireira to replace Memphis and wilson on the right IMO.

254~~~
We have some players on our hands in Martial and Wilson. I rate Wilson higher than any youth that has come out of our academy since the class of 92, we NEED to hold onto him. In practice football has kinda moved away from two strikers but imagine a simple 442 with Memphis and Januzaj on the wings supplying Wilson and Martial. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

255~~~
The good thing about Wilson, Pereira, Martial, Januzaj and Memphis is that none of them (with the possible exception of Wilson and Martial) are competing with each other in their positions. Pereira will be moulded into an 8/10 hybrid a la Herrera, Wilson is a striker, though can do just as good as job as a wide forward, ditto Martial and Januzaj (if we don't bring anyone in) will be on the right, along with Memphis on the left. Pretty much a perfect symmetry to their positional play too, and hopefully they will get game time together to build up a rapport. A pretty tantalising prospect if it works out <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

256~~~
Indeed and lets not forget Shaw! Surely with the exception of Shaw at least two of Martial, Januzaj, Wilson, Memphis and Pereira will go on and become world class players (or very close to it). Exciting future ahead.

257~~~

258~~~
He has to make an impression this season I think, it's concerning he can't even get in the bench when the only competition is martial and an out of form Rooney, even fellaini seems to be ahead of him. Doesn't look like he will play tomorrow which is a bit of a shame I think.

259~~~
Very disappointed that he won't be given a chance tomorrow. Why refuse to loan him if he can't make the squad for a cup game against lower league opposition.

260~~~
How do u know he wont

261~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Sep/Issues-in-defence-for-Manchester-United-against-Ipswich-Town.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...r-Manchester-United-against-Ipswich-Town.aspx</a>

Meanwhile, young duo James Wilson and Jesse Lingard won’t be required to face Ipswich after they both scored in 90-minute displays for the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2015/Sep/match-report-manchester-united-under-21-v-everton-under-21.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Under-21s against Everton</a> on Monday.

The manager added: "I don’t need them so they can have a day off and then Thursday they will be fresh and can train."

262~~~
Ouch that's a bit disheartening for both of them, to not even get a chance on the bench.

263~~~
So why hasn't he gone out on loan yet, again ?

Doesn't make sense. What the feck are we doing with him ?


LVG seems to rate U21 football much higher than it is.

264~~~
Probably Rooney getting injured put a halt to it.

265~~~
Wouldnt blame them if they wanted to leave.

Im still under the impression (same talent wise) if we had bought Wilson he would be playing (and obviously on more money).

266~~~
Van Gaal needed another striker for training games?

267~~~
We wouldn't have bought Wilson as he hasn't yet shown anything to warrant a purchase by a top club.

268~~~
Which is a bit bizarre, because Wilson wasn't even on the bench whilst Rooney was out.

269~~~
Lingard is 3 full years older than Wilson. Him wanting to go to play full time first team football is fully understandable. Wilson leaving for that reason would be crazy, his chance will come. Even if that means sticking around until LVG leaves,  he'll be 21 and still have time on his side.

270~~~
No doubt. I mean, we basically did buy him, except French and expensive.

271~~~
Like we didnt buy Bebe, Bellion, Martial...

You can buy on potential and youre more inclined to give them a chance than youth from your own setup.

272~~~
Anyone else find this a bit odd?

We are not exactly blessed with big squad depth in terms of strikers and wingers and the Carling Cup is the perfect time to rest the likes of Mata and Depay who have started every competitive fixture this season.  I'd have though Rooney and Martial would also be rested from this match.  I could see Fellaini and Young starting tomorrow but would have thought two from Pereira, Lingard and Wilson would have been starting this match, especially with United being back in the Champions League and the fact that we have not loaned Wilson out.

LVG's mention of a day off sounds like Lingard and Wilson are not even going to be including in the subs.

273~~~
Loans have played a large part in the development of a number of young players.  It's better for a young footballer to being playing regularly if he has outgrown reserve and youth football.

Loans helped Welbeck, Cleverley, Wilshire all develop as players just by simply playing regularly.   Plenty of other examples as well.  They don't always work out but there comes a point when they only way to develop is to play regularly.

274~~~
Not sure about this. It could be argued that the reason it's rare for a young player at a big club to make it after a loan is because said player wasn't good enough. Usually if a player is going to be the real deal, they won't need a loan. They will force their way into the team right at the beginning.

275~~~
It is very strange and disappointing. If you can't give him a chance against Ipswich then he's not going to get one at all.

276~~~
I wonder if he's not impressing LvG in training.

277~~~
I think it's just a case of lacking "match rhythm".The U21s game last Monday is the first time Wilson and Lingard has ever played at any level this season (if we don't count BCD friendlies which I think both of them only had featured once).Considering how long did it takes until LVG started to put Rojo on the bench (he had to play a friendly vs. Ajax B before that) it wouldn't surprise me if that was the case.

It's a waste to play Wilson at U21s level though definitely.He scored 1 assisted 1 vs. Ajax B and did the same vs. Everton U21s despite not looking like he put 100% onto it.His issue has always been matching his game with the tactical side of senior football.On U21s football he'll just get the ball and start to run at defenders, which he wouldn't have the same luxury on the first team due to various reasons so even if he scores 50+ goals with the U21s it wouldn't help his chance with the first team.

278~~~
Looking at Transfermarkt's stats, LVG seemed to lose interest in Wilson around the time he changed our formation to a single striker system 4-3-3. Wilson went from getting a few mins most games to nothing from mid Feb until the last game of the season. A bit weird given Wilson's goals were scored in Jan (QPR) and early Feb (Cambridge). He spent March and April playing in the U21s.

I have to say that the contrast between LVG's patience towards older players who are woefully out of form (Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Fletcher etc) and his treatment of younger players doesn't impress me in the slightest.

The younger out-field players (McNair, Pereira, Lingard and Wilson) should all get 10+ starts (mostly League Cup and FA cup), otherwise they should be out on loan.

279~~~
I hope that's right but you mention not giving a 100% in the U21 game yesterday, I wonder if frustration is getting to him and affecting things a bit, it must be difficult to see a striker the same age as you bought and get starts immediately. The only way to get him up to speed playing-wise is to involve him, even if it's just 20 minutes here and there at first, as the U21's just don't play often enough for him to build up any of LvG's "match rythym" that way.

280~~~
I kind of want to see him and Martial play in a two striker line up for once with Basti and Carrick in a midfield picking them out. Sunderland are shit enough to try out a 4-4-2 for nostalgia sake right?

281~~~
Rooney will always play so that's a big no.Not the worst idea in paper though.

282~~~
Play Rooney for 90 mins vs Ipswich and "rest" him for Sunderland.

283~~~
I hate to say this but for Wilson's own development he needs to leave United. If he can't even make the bench against Ipswich in the cup when we only have 2 other strikers at the club - it's hard to see him having a future under van Gaal. I would love to be wrong though

284~~~
Just what I was about to say. Wilson is in limbo, in the first team squad but never likely to play. Added to that, U-21 matches are few and far between so little chance there to get match time. If I were his agent or parent I'd be advising him to leave as he's at the stage where he needs regular football if he is to develop and be the best he can be. Lingard is beginning to look as though he's in the same position.

285~~~
Why on earth Wilson cant get a game for us, I have no idea. Especially since his competitions are only Fellaini who is rubbish. Lvg is supposed to be a manager who brings local lads through, yet Wilson cant get a game? Not even on the bench? Dont tell me Wilson isnt good enough. This kid is one of our best young talents since the class of 92 alongside Januzaj and Pereira. This is  wrong management. WTF is going on.

286~~~
Didn't LVG say he was going on loan at a fan even about two weeks ago?  We are wasting his time.

287~~~
Listen, if and when Wilson is good enough for the first team, Van Gaal will put him in - he has no problem playing young players - look at Shaw and Martial this season.  Wilson didn't show enough in the opportunities he had last season for me.  As for Ipswich - I think LVG has learned from the embarrassment of MK Dons and he doesn't want to risk a repeat.

288~~~
Fellaini has more balance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

289~~~
So why not send him out on loan? Why leave him sitting around doing nothing when he could be at another club developing his game and learning?

It's clear he's way down the pecking order in Van Gaal's mind and he's just wasting Wilson's time.

290~~~
As is Johnstone. Although in his case he may want to wait 1 more year before deciding.

291~~~
Look i'll be honest I think he is overrated slightly and hasn't really convinced me on his first team chances YET but I find his absence pretty surprising this season with the lack of depth we have. Give him the chances or loan him out, he is too good for under 21's football that is for sure.

292~~~
Two points.

Firstly the issue isn't really that people think Wilson should be a regular or anything. It's just that it doesn't make sense that we have been rejecting chances to send him on loan but won't give him any minutes ourselves, not even in the league cup.

Secondly the Shaw and Martial examples seem a bit disingenuous. They were both big money signings who were already playing regularly at other teams. Van Gaal would look silly if he paid so much for them and then didn't give them chances. It's his use of players from our own academy that is a causing a little bit of concern. Last season Januzaj, Wilson and Pereira got less minutes combined than Falcao. Three hugely promising players being held back by a washed-up loanee isn't the sort of thing United should be doing imo.

293~~~
I won't say he needs to leave but he sure as feck needs to ask our management what exactly the plan is. We didn't send him out on loan though teams wanted him. Yet, he can't get on the bench and now won't even be fielded in the bloody Carling Cup. Bizarre. It isn't good for his development at all.

294~~~
I really don't like this business of putting players down simply because Lvg doesn't fancy them. Of course he's the manager so makes the decisions. But the idea that Wilson isn't good enough is ludicrous. Wilson isn't good enough, yet Fellaini is?

The kid exudes class the every time he's on the pitch. In the Liverpool game last season he was average and people shot him down because of it. But against QPR away he showed his talent. He has bright football brain, intelligent movements, great energy, enthusiasm, can get past people, got pace, sharp eyes for goals. He's a natural finisher, one that we never have from our own academy for how many years.

When such a talent like Wilson cant get a game yet Fellaini can, I cant think of it other than bad management.

For years we have waited for exceptional talents to come through from our academy, yet when they do appear we waste them? Januzaj's been already kicked out on loan, now Wilson and Pereira cant get a game. This spells disaster for our homegrown talents.

295~~~
It's fairly obvious what's happened here. We couldn't let Wilson go out on loan with Rooney the only striker at the club and the timing of the Martial signing meant it left us little or no time to find the right loan for him. Sending players out on loan always carries a risk that it will feck up their development far worse than staying put, if they end up with the wrong manager/team. I'd far rather he stays put until January then get rushed off somewhere where he'll get no more minutes and train/play with a load of donkeys. It really is fecking tedious the way people will use <i>anything</i> as a means to have a pop at the club/manager these days. Well I say "these days" but this forum has always had people who insist they know more about developing young players than the coaching staff at Manchester United but they do seem a lot more numerous/vocal in the post-Fergie era.

296~~~
Either LVG doesn't think we currently have a enough depth in the squad in this position or he feels he will develop better at United. I don't think he would get a regular game at any Premier League team bar maybe Norwich so it would be a Championship loan if he went.

297~~~
Both Lingard and Wilson deserved to be at least on the bench.. Lingard would also play as 10 better than Rooney currently, he's a bit like our Mané, had a great game for u21, completely outgrown that level..

298~~~
I still don't know where to play him, he is too weak to play upfront, I would like to see more of him on the right wing.

299~~~
So we can question United's transfer business on this forum but we can't question the manager about how he manages youth players?Should just close down the caf for good sake.

300~~~
It is so difficult to judge young players from a fans perspective. We see them make the odd cameo off the bench or in pre-season, and a few fans watch them at U21 level, which is miles behind first team football. But most of us have a quite understandable bias to players from our academy, we believe in them because we so badly want them to be great.
I gave Cleverly years of leeway for that reason when I look back at it now.

Point being, we really have to back our managers judgement when it comes to youngsters. I cant trust my own, and LvG has a record of developing youngsters, he wouldn't hinder a players development if that player was ready

301~~~
Nothing wrong with sensible criticism but when there's a really obvious explanation for what's going on (the one in my post you quoted) then all the moaning just seems like part of the general background whinging that has ramped up spectacularly since Fergie retired.

302~~~
Martial, Rooney and Fellaini (as a last resort) are all ahead of Wilson, so I'm not exactly sure your "really obvious explanation" holds up. Is it so much better for him to be sitting in the stand every week twiddling his thumbs than playing, even at a Championship club?

303~~~
We started Wilson ahead of falcao against Liverpool even. I don't think we would have done that if we didn't rate him. We had to give more chances to falcao to see whether he still is good enough so as to buy him permanently. In hindsight, we can say he is washed up but a manager can't take decisions like how you or I can. We gave chances to loads of academy players. McNair was pretty much a mainstay last season. So was Blackett to an extent. Januzaj actually played games. He unfortunately didn't perform well enough to warrant a place in the team. I don't think we have ever put a player in the team if he didn't stake a claim with his performances under Fergie also.

304~~~
Feck me. You didn't even read the "really obvious explanation", did you?

305~~~
He's really not. It's hard to imagine anyone who's watched him play at all seriously wanting to play him anywhere other than #9.

306~~~
I have seen him play and while I'm convinced that he has all the technical attributes to be a great striker, I'm unsure about his physique. He reminds me Gameiro.

307~~~
Yes, I did, but it doesn't hold up. Do you imagine Ed just woke up and said to himself "I think we'll sign Martial today"? Of course not, negotiations would have been going on long enough for us to have put contingency plans in place for Wilson if and when Martial signed.

I can't see any circumstances in which Van Gaal will play Wilson, even in the unlikely event that Martial and Rooney are injured. How could he start him when he hasn't been on the pitch all season?

308~~~
You think the clubs considering getting him on loan were happy leaving a vacancy in their first team squad just waiting there right up to the end of the transfer window, in case we decided we could use it?

Same way he'd start any other player who's needed in an injury crisis. Wilson is getting games for the U21s. Van Gaal has already made it quite clear he sees those games as preparatory work for first team matches.

309~~~
Not at all, the loan window runs from 9th Sept to the 25th.



The u/21s have very few games e.g. they haven't got another game for a month.

310~~~
It's pretty clear that the club wanted him to go out on loan so maybe we are still looking at all the options for him rather than just sending him to any club just for a chance at first team football. I can understand the frustration some people have but I don't see any real reason for the management to have any sort of bias against him while giving other young players a chance.

311~~~
Van gaal isnt playing him because he isnt a striker anymore and needs work towards playing on the right hand side.

It happened in pre-season where Januzaj scored from the centre &  wilson set him up from the wings.

We cant send him out on loan because most teams will probably end up playing him upfront.

312~~~
That's just bizarre.

313~~~
Amazing how many prem level players we have in our ranks yet we spend lots of monet to fill the squad year upon year. The coaches of the teams that play against our u21's or other big teams are failing their clubs. Lots of unused talent doing the rounds in english football.

314~~~
Yes and loaning a player is like signing a player. Clubs will want it done as early as possible. Once the season starts it immediately becomes harder to find a club with an appropriate vacancy in their squad.



That won't stop Wilson being promoted if both Rooney and Wilson got injured. 

Right now, it obviously does make sense to send him on loan. I'm sure the club are looking into this. It really isn't the end of the world (for him or us) if we need to wait until the next window to find the right one for him.

315~~~
Where did you learn this gem? Or are you just making shit up?

316~~~
Agree with this. He's quick, has good movement and, being left footed, would cut in effectively from the right. A front three of Memphis, Martial and Wilson could be really exciting.

317~~~
His physique is pretty good for a 19-year old. He'll get stronger, obviously, but he's certainly not lacking in that department at the moment. He's actually got about the same build as Martial at the moment.

But these preconceptions do tend to hang around youngsters. Obviously he was quite willowy (ho ho) when he was 17. That's why new signings tend to get an easier ride than our own kids with fans.

318~~~
it is made up but what we lack now is not a second striker is it?  We have martial starting with rooney taking the forward spot on occasion. 

What we lack is a RW who cuts in an uses his left foot.  Up until the moment we buy that player -  i solely believe that van gaal wants wilson to take mata's spot eventually when he is ready to do so.

319~~~
On tour Wilson played as a central striker with the exception of one game when he played on the left wing. He was involved in the build-up for Lingard's goal against Barcelona, with the assist coming from Blackett. Jesse Lingard supplied the assist for Januzaj's goal late in the same game. I watched all the matches on tour. At no stage was Wilson used on the right.

320~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

321~~~
What's most disappointing isn't that he hasn't been starting games, but that he's not been on the bench when we have no recognised strikers there, like in our last game (or two). It really would have been ideal to give him game time tonight to bring him on a bit more and it's not a super risk either, at home, with club captain Rooney slotting in behind him.

<a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> He doesn't have the physicality yet to be an out and out lone striker (and maybe that will never be his role) but Rooney hasn't really shown any of his previous strength when he's played up front. Martial of course has been class. Fellaini has the strength, but no first touch so he's a liability up front. Given our options, it's quite bizarre that Wilson is not on the bench every single game, at least.

So was memphis used at AM as a directory influence on how to play once he cuts in on the left wing. 

The fact wilson played on the left wing is most likely to improve his abilities as a winger with his left foot; things like crossing are much easier on the left than on the right with a left footed individual.  The goal scoring aspect of wilsons game doesn't need half the work as the rest of his ability as a winger. 

I also saw all the pre-season games and left winger or right winger doesn't matter half as much as the fact he did not play as a striker; so i dont really know what <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>  finds so funny.

323~~~
Nah, he is wiry strong and already looks a man among boys when he plays for the U-21s. Some journos were even tweeting during the Everton game that he is far too good to be playing among the U-21s. I frankly don't think he's far from the first team if given the chance, he showed as much when he played last season.

If he played for any club bar Chelsea or City he'd be getting games by now.

324~~~
I initially found funny the way you insisted he couldn't go on loan because Van Gaal wanted him to play on the right wing, despite never once playing him in that position himself. What's even funnier is your deluded insistence he didn't play as a striker when that's exactly what he did in all but one pre-season games.

325~~~
He should get games, I haven't said that he shouldn't, I said that I would like to see him on the right or left because I'm unsure about the physical part of his game, Wilson plays weak, in the game he played at professional level he played weak like Martial or Januzaj did in the past. I'm not saying that it will be the case forever but at the moment he does and since he has the ability to grind some games somewhere else, I would like to see what he can do.

326~~~
As far as I can tell, Wilson was used on the left wing for 45 mins in one game so LVG could take a look at Januzaj as the main striker with Pereira as no 10. In other matches Wilson was the main striker with Januzaj as no 10 and Pereira on the left, Lingard played on the right in each game he got mins. Wilson performed poorly on the tour when used as the main striker.

At the moment I would suggest that Wilson looks best suited to the type of performance we saw from him against QPR, where we have the lead but are sitting back, looking to create chances on the break. He could also be an option if we need to score but his link-up play hasn't been that great whenever he has featured in the first team. If our opponents are sitting deep then Fellaini is perhaps a more sensible option if we have players who can cross the ball.

327~~~
His last game came on as a winger.  He does shite all as a striker.  Lets see today where he starts.  If van gaal rates him at all the only position available for him is RW for now and the future.

328~~~
Young men his age, put on muscle pretty fast. So I think a summer's worth of training and weight work would already have done wonders for him. IIRC someone posted a while ago that he broke Rooney's leg press record over the summer, which suggests he has developed a very strong lower body since he last played for the first team at the end of last season.

Infact watching the game yesterday I got the exact opposite impression, that the Everton defenders were struggling to cope with him physically. He got bored for a while and even started making some strong tackles in midfield.

329~~~
Look I'm not making any projection, I'm only thinking about now and where he could play for us and gain some playing time. You don't have to convince me that he is potentially the real deal.

330~~~
More nonsense. 

Oh and he won't start today. That's been established.

331~~~
I'm sorry if English is not your first language. This is what I read from your own post:

This is the gist of what I'm saying:

He's not weak and he can play as a center forward RIGHT NOW.

332~~~
To be fair, he didn't look physically up to PL football last season. Lost almost every physical battle he was involved in. He may well have beefed up over the summer as he's at an age where he'll suddenly stop growing taller and pack on a load of muscle. Based on first team appearances it's certainly not outrageous to say he hasn't looked the strongest (even if "weak" is a little harsh)

333~~~
And I'm unsure of that right now, in the future we will see. I want to see him upfront AND on the right and judge from that, AND at professional level.

The key point is that I'm unsure.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Edit: like Pogue said "weak" is a bit much.

334~~~
One thing's for sure, at the moment there's no likelihood of anyone finding out whether he's best suited to either wing or central striker.

335~~~
He says, less than 24 hours after Wilson put in an excellent performance as a central striker...

336~~~
He's only ever played on the right once at any level and that was against Spurs for the u21's last year in order to accommodate Falcao. Although I agree that he has the skill set to play rw your repeated insistence that this should be his position seems to be based on nothing other than Van Gaal liking inverted wingers

337~~~
That was last January. He has always had extremely powerful legs and Butt or Scholes said near the end of the 13-14 season he has the best standing jump they've ever seen, he also generates a great amount of power from a standing shot and powerful legs obviously help with his explosive pace as well.

338~~~
I get what you have been saying in this thread Pogue but are you not surprised we can't even find a spot for Wilson on the bench in the Carling cup?

It's purely an issue to do with the squad for me.  Wilson's the 4 choice striker if you include Fellaini as a number 9 and for him to not even to be considered I have got to assume that means that we are going to be using more members of the first than than usual.  Just find that odd with United being back in the Champions league, especially when LVG himself said that the players were tired in the last 15 minutes against Southampton after the PSV game.

339~~~
Half of the championship clubs want him. 4/5 managers have said openly.

Don't think finding a good loan would be that tough. Even could be put into the loan contract.

340~~~
Aye we could always recall him and he is young enough to go on a youth loan anyway which allows him to train with us and play u21 matches.

341~~~
I'm also disappointed he's not going to feature tonight, don't get me wrong. Just don't buy the idea we're somehow ruining him by not sending him out on loan immediately. I have mixed feelings about the loan system anyway. So hard to get it right.

342~~~
Him and Lingard can't even make the bench for a game against Ipswich? Hardly encouraging stuff really <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

Really don't understand why they're being kept at club, while Januzaj is given a loan.

343~~~
They played on Monday.

344~~~
Exactly....for the reserves.

345~~~
This is really really silly.

346~~~
What has his form been like for the U/21s this season? For anyone that watches them regularly.

347~~~
Rested for the weekend maybe? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

348~~~
Only played 1 game just on Monday where he scored and I think got an assist. Looked clearly above the level but then he looked above the level by the end of the 13-14 season too.

349~~~
Cheers for that.

350~~~
You have to imagine that at some point he will at least be on the bench. We can't have abandoned plans to send him on loan with the intention of never letting him on a football pitch again.

351~~~
Makes no sense to play him a reserve game on the Monday when there is a League Cup the next day. Unless there are a injury crisis, i dont see him getting any games

352~~~
Wishful thinking. It was a strange decision.

353~~~

354~~~
I'm sad for him that he don't make a bench anymore when he was quite regular on the bench last season even if we had RVP, Rooney and Falcao as strikers. LVG said himself that it will do no good to his development if he have another season like last one when he just can't break in the first team but in the end he didn't go on loan. I saw Gary, i think it was post-match against Liverpool, moaning that he doesn't know what is happening with him.
It is clear that he have a great potential but he need to play to develop. We will play a lot of games this season, especially if we go far in the CL and in the cups so i hope he will get a lot of opportunities. TBF he didn't used the opportunities last season very well as a striker, in the pre-season he played on the wing 2 or 3 times if i am not mistaken, can he do the job on the wing in the first team?

355~~~
Nice to see him get a run out, he looked lively. Some nice link up and movement with Martial as well.

356~~~
Looked sharp and lively when he came on, added some much needed pace.

357~~~
Looked very good when he came on, hopefully will get some more game time in the future, will give some of the other lads a rest.

358~~~
About time we go for pace upfront with him and Martial.

359~~~
Won't mind him and Martial starting a game together.

360~~~
Why is this lad not getting any football, it's madness really.

361~~~
Because the elephant is still in the room

362~~~
Thought we sold Ando?

363~~~
You know who I'm talking about

364~~~
Him, Martial and Mata is our best bet as a front three this season. Rooney and Depay don't seem like they're going to be giving us anything.

365~~~
#FreeWilson

Seriously though, with Rooney and Memphis stinking it up for weeks now, it's ridiculous that he haven't gotten some game time before today. Hopefully that trend is turning now.

366~~~
He was decent when he came on, I really don't think he'd offer us less than Rooney at this point so why not give him a go.

367~~~
im usually very critical of him as i rate him very highly but think he had a good cameo today and hopefully LVG will start using him more often.

368~~~
I'd really like to see him get a go. I know he's a bit weak and raw but he has pace and he moves, instantly making him a far superior player to Rooney.
A front three of Memphis, Martial and Wilson could cause some havoc then again Memphis has been more or less completely shit since he signed.

369~~~
That's a bit harsh on Memphis imo, I do like your idea of that front three though, put Mata,  Schneiderlin, and Herrera/Schweinstegier in behind and we could be getting somewhere.

Sadly Rooney muddies the waters with this idea.

370~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Needs more game time, this guy is so talented. He looked like he linked up well with Martial too.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

375~~~
I'd like to see him be given the chance to operate from the left in place of Memphis. He can't possibly do worse and he actually has pace for a start.

376~~~
This phrasing is weird as it seems to suggest that Memphis is slow.

377~~~
I'd like to see him get some games as a wide forward, I think he has the skill set to excel there.

378~~~
Well I wouldn't suggest that Memphis is overly quick? From what I have seen Wilson looks to have a lot more pace than Memphis.

379~~~
Memphis is most definitely not the quickest for a wide forward.

380~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

382~~~
I'm not sure what he did to impress against Arsenal in the 10 minutes he was on? But yes, want to see more of him, hopefully he'll start making some appearances off the bench, both him and Pereira

383~~~
Possibly but he's not slow either. He'd outrun most players.

384~~~
Adam Marshall just posted this on manutd.com

Interesting because you don't often see the official site put up articles like this where the writer is essentially asking for a specific player to be given time in the team.

385~~~
Can you sort out your quote/link there?

386~~~
Is it working now?

I just copied and pasted and it inserted all these tags I didn't want and then went crazy when I took them out.

387~~~
Working now. Thanks.

388~~~
Interesting to hear LVG's thoughts on a loan. I hope we can bring in another forward in January and loan him out. He's not good enough to really play a part for us right now and needs to get some consistent senior football. Maybe a top Championship side.

389~~~
As the article states '<i>The views expressed in this article are personal to the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Manchester United.'</i>
These kinds of articles have been published before, nothing new.

390~~~
To be fair he is definitely the third best striker at the club and given Rooney's form he might even be second by the end of season. Then again Cameron Jerome would be the second best striker at United now.

391~~~
We should play him as a forward wide player, kinda like how Martial being playing for France, It would be interesting to see. I'd like to see Depay given a shot upfront, I don't know why but I think it could work.

392~~~
Is that not even photoshopped?!

393~~~
Bag a couple and put some pressure on Rooney tonight.

394~~~
limping about after a stupid foul on his part. Silly boy.

395~~~
What foul ? 

He'll be fine, i think. Usually looks to be limping mid game many times.


Anyway, he's held his own physically better than i expected. Though he doesn't fit in with the philosophy.

396~~~
Where he had about 5 first touches going towards our own goal then eventually put it out for a throw in (my mistake) but not before having a hack at his defender.

397~~~
His first touch looks like a problem. For him, not the defenders.

398~~~
Ah, don't think a foul was given there but a throw in.

I saw him limping after the sandwich between the 2 defenders and GK though.

399~~~
The foul the linesman gave was a joke. To be honest. This game don't suit Wilson. He's an off the shoulder striker and there's very little space. I hope we bring on Martial, play him as the focal point and put Wilson on the wing for Depay. Let Martial give us some composure in the final third and get Wilson's touches in and around the box. He can link play but I don't think it's a strength. Give him room to run at players and hopefully he'll grab himself a goal

400~~~
Feel for Wilson. Desperately needs to be playing football, especially as the U21s have barely played this season.

401~~~
Rooney must be really happy somewhere inside, this is really not a player who could challenge me... Should go on loan and paly and paly and play, this long pause wouldn't help anybody, he looks like stagnating or even reggresing from his form 2 seasons back.. 

Martial on

402~~~
Harsh taking him off, was feeding off scraps first  half.

403~~~
Think he was limping at the end of the half.

404~~~
Oh right missed that.

405~~~
Unless he was injured weirdest and harsh decision to take him off. And that too for a shit Rooney.

I quite fancy that he would have gotten a goal when the game opened up about after 65 minutes or so till end of ET.

406~~~
Has no chance of making it here for me. Very average.

407~~~
Doesn't looks strong enough yet to play as a #9 at senior level.

408~~~
I hope he will make it playing for a smaller club. Probably his last game as a starter for United.

409~~~
Not the game for him. He could have done more but the only balls we played forward for much of the first half, were so bad they went out of play. I think it's a shame so many players lacked ambition. We need to get him much higher up the pitch.

410~~~
Was getting bullied and lost nearly every contest.

411~~~

412~~~
genuinely pissed I was convinced by entire caf here that he is a top prospect and started to believe it but he never looks like cutting it at top level. either it's for injuries or lack of confidence he jsut doesn!t seem good enough even for a bench appearance.. needs to get fit, almost all the time I see him he looks like he can run just 15 minutes and is saving energy for whatever reason, and perhaps a loan in championship/league 1, after one or two seasons let him go on preseason and at 22 he can be ready. His hold up play is non existent, aerial play something he is really bad at too.. sometimes even hhis biggest asset dribbling is off too, not strong enough for senior football but the loan could really help.

It's just really sad situation for him being 3rd striker in the team, Va Gaal trusting garbage Rooney and keeping Willo if anything happens but perhaps things change soon And we buy attacker in Jan and he gets his loan

413~~~
Very annoying with the injuries, hopefully he grows out of it.

414~~~
Shame about the injury, the lack of service, his modest contribution on the few occasions he received the ball, his minimal playing time this season, indeed the few mins he has had under LVG.

415~~~
He didn't get much chance last night to be fair to him, And I'm one that isn't massively convinced by him to be honest.

416~~~
Wilson is a player who certainly won't thrive under this regime. He's at his best when he can run with the ball, when we're attacking at pace and when there's space to use. Our approach won't stretch teams and in close quarters Wilson isn't as useful.

417~~~
Another underwhelming showing for him sadly. Even after a couple of games, people on here were still claiming that he is a similar talent to Martial, but I've never seen anything of the sort above reserve team level.

418~~~
Frustrating, he's a very good finisher but just doesn't seem to get the service. Agree with Marjen, he's built for a counter attacking team, he'd do well at West Ham with the tactics they currently employ for example. Our slow plodding football simply isn't his cup of tea.

419~~~
He's quite obviously above reserve level, he's just not at the standard required to line up for Manchester United. There's a smidge of difference there. Looks like he'll be going out on loan in January then. Can't see any more matches we can play him in.

420~~~
He isnt strong enough, might do a job from then wings tho.

421~~~
This.

He is a player you wanna have when the game gets stretched. Would have been more useful after  70 minutes, imo. Actually as i said before would have fancied him to get a goal when the game opened up from that point to end of ET.

422~~~
Far too young to write him off, it's genuinely as if some people expect him to score a couple of goals every game he plays. 

He does need to bulk up a bit though, going to a team like Bournemouth who have lost all their strikers would do him wonders I think.

423~~~
Average performance last night but had to come deep to receive the ball, which isn't the kind of play he thrives in. I'd of loved to have seen him upfront whilst Martial and Lingaard were running on the counter with the ball.

Also, I'm not sure why people are claiming that's his last game for United? He signed a 4 year contract about 2 months ago, that's definitely not his last game, he'll go out on loan in January. Giggs also rates him highly, so I cant see him going anywhere permanently.

424~~~
People just love to claim things like that on the internet so that when it turns out to be right they can say "I told you so".

Will always be difficult for him playing the way we did.Aerial ability and playing with his back to goal are his current weaknesses.The kind of through ball that Pereira put him through for his only shot in goal is how to use him, or just let him run with the ball near the box.

Of course to become a regular Man United striker he has to sort out those current downsides of his game.

425~~~
I have a limited knowledge of his exploits, he seems to me to be best suited alongside another striker, something that's rarely done these days. That being said, a loan is in order, kid needs to play.

426~~~
Not majorly surprising really considering his age, lack of experience, and the fact that he was playing as a lone striker against relatively solid opposition. 

Once again people are being far too quick to write off a young player. It's a shame for him that he didn't go on loan somewhere this season. He needs regular games to develop his game, which tbf LvG said himself during the summer.

427~~~
Couldn't agree more. I still think he has the talent to at the very least be a squad player with us. As everybody has said he needs game time.

428~~~
I'm not hugely impressed with what I've seen with him in general and yesterday was another performance to add to that. 

I don't think he has the skill set to be much more than, at best, a poacher in the ilk of Hernandez and, therefore, a good squad player for us. I'd be happy for him to prove me wrong, of course, but I don't see the physical or technical attributes that will see him make it at the top of the game.

429~~~
I agree but only game time will allow him to do so and training, of course. He could also do a job so us on the left.

430~~~
Disappointing from him, when you get opportunities to play at his age you've got to grab them and he didn't really do that. He definitely needs to go out on loan in January.

431~~~
Yeah, but he's still really young. I won't give up on his talent until at least another 2 years. He'll fill in physically and be better equip to playing with his back to goal.

432~~~
I've been thinking the same, playing Wilson and Martial as wide forwards wouldn't be to bad of an idea, I remember watching Wilson play as a RW in LVG first season and he did pretty well there, got goals and created more than a few chances in his limited time there.
I see Goss and Pereira as a well balanced CM pairing, Januzaj as a potential WC #10. I wouldn't mind seeing Depay upfront for a game or 2, where he doesn't have to do much tracking back, would not be restricted in a fixed position and would be able to focus solely on attacking what he's best at. There's alot of great talents we have at the club, I just they all get their due chance and we try to get the best out of them before we give up on them. There's also Pearson.

433~~~
Time to give the lad a run out or two, I can't fathom why he was trusted last season and not this. 

Madness given our striker shortage.

434~~~
He's injured and had a virus for a couple of weeks before that

435~~~
He's also not really impressed when he has played.

Concerning that he's not in the squad today given the situation. I hope there is no truth in the rumours about attitude problems.

440~~~
What rumors would that be? Twitter-f*cktardation based on the fact that he chews gum? He's injured.

Just watched this video, I really want him to do well for us, he is a player for future. I'd like to see Martial and Wilson outwide for us with Depay upfront, potentially a devastating frontline.

442~~~
There is something special about Wilson, he will get his time to shine soon.

443~~~
LvG said after the game that he was not in the squad because of a swollen knee after Fridays training session.

444~~~
He is quite injury prone. Big concern with him.
