1~~~

2~~~
His hair looks better.

3~~~
I am hoping to see him playing and scoring tonight.

4~~~
With no other strikers besides Wilson, there is no reason why he can't come off the bench and help but the way we play, I'm not going to be expecting much from him this season unfortunately.

5~~~
Chicharito is back! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> he's going to have a great season I think and will bring speed, movement, urgency and goals. Most deadly Mexican since Gustavo Fring

6~~~
He's going to be our super sub or hopefully first striker if Rooney's form goes south.

7~~~
Bring him on.

8~~~
Hope he gets at least half an hour against Brugge.

9~~~
I'd start him against brugge and against Newcastle if he does OK. Rooney was shit against Spurs and much worse tonight.

10~~~
Given the way Rooney played up top it can't be long before Chico gets a run out. Wouldn't shock me if he scores on his first appearance for United this season.

11~~~
The only difference he would bring over Rooney is energy, which is actually a plus at the moment. Either way, I would not put much hope in him, but I believe he should get a chance right now. 

Even if he runs around like a headless chicken, that would already be much better than Rooney's performance for us so far.

12~~~
He's not good enough to be our main striker, but I'd play him against Brugge and hope it gets Rooneys finger out his arse.

13~~~
If Rooney maintains his current dire form, and we don't pick up another striker, I wouldn't mind seeing Hernandez get a few games. He was good enough to start for us in the business end of the 2010-11 season, a year in which we were champions, so I don't think it's inconceivable that he can contribute to this current United set-up.

14~~~
I was hoping he'd get the last 20 minutes last night. He's not the answer overall but he will do a better job of actually staying pressed up on the CB's and not keep dropping deep into the #10's space.

15~~~
Hernandez has had one bad season in his top flight career, and that was the season under Moyes where everyone was garbage. I have complete confidence that if Van Gaal plays him up top for us he will score goals. 

In 2010/11 he pretty much won us the title and was vital to us getting to the European Cup final. In 2012/13 he outscored Rooney. Along the way he has scored some genuinely vital goals, in big games, especially against Chelsea and Liverpool. One chance, like Ole, all the lad needs is one chance.

16~~~
It all went pear shaped when we brought RvP. Previously he was second choice and could be guaranteed to get minutes, but then we had Rooney and RvP so he slipped even further down the pecking order. If he's our second striker, which looks likely at this point in time, I would fancy him doing well. LvG really needs to show some faith in him though. Hopefully he comes on against Brugge and scores and we settle the tie in the first leg so he can start in the second.

17~~~
Really do not see Rooney being dropped.

18~~~
Seems west ham going after yilmaz now so we probably refused their overtures for cheech.

19~~~
Quite lively when he came on today.

Even his touch was on today and consistent.

20~~~
Good cameo today. His touch looks improved and he did well on the ball. I wouldn't mind it at all to see him start in place of Rooney.

21~~~
Really impressed with him today. Hold-up play, link-up play and runs in behind.

22~~~
Very good cameo I thought. Even his first touch looked good.

23~~~
Nice to see him back, looked sharp.

24~~~
better touch , would have had him on for rooney earlier.

25~~~
Good to see him again. Surprised to see him looking noticeably older, I thought he'd be like Ole.

26~~~
His touch was miles better than anything Rooney's showed thus far.

Good movement in behind their defence as well. Enthusiastic.

27~~~
Looked lively when he come on.

28~~~
He wasn't bad, especially when he's barely played football for years.

29~~~
If there's 1 person I could have in an impossible situation, it would be him. I love his never give up attitude.

30~~~
Did well tbf.

31~~~
Really wanted him to score, think he needs a dose of the redemption Fellaini enjoyed.

He either looked really determined or angry not sure which but it was a change from his smiley self <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

32~~~
Thought he was very positive tonight when he came on. First touch and movement were both very sharp.

33~~~
I missed him. Hopefully van Gaal gives him proper game time and a chance to make an impact like we all know he can. Can be a brilliant super sub and that second striker we need.

34~~~
Altogether useful and his support play was far better than anything we've seen from Rooney. Looks hungry.

35~~~
Came on against a tired team but he made a good contribution. I hope he gets more minutes and can do something. I can only see him coming on as a sub until we actually rotate - hopefully then he can have a good game.

36~~~
Very good cameo. Overall play was good.

37~~~
He did pretty well I thought. Promising.

38~~~
Good appearance

39~~~
Hard not to love him. Great reception too.

I do feel a bit sorry for him. He's never going to be a regular starter in a LvG team.

40~~~
He looked fresh and dangerous. Really glad for him he got his chance at United again.

41~~~
I never thought I'd see him play in a United shirt again, welcome back Hernandez! Here's hoping he can do what Falcao couldn't for us.

42~~~
Like Fellaini, he really wanted it when it came on, and just the fact that he was actually moving around with purpose and desire was refreshing.

43~~~
Delighted to see him back; hope he gets more time in the upcoming games and has a good season.

44~~~
He did look pretty hungry and sharp, I think he deserves either a start with Rooney in #10 (we all know he won't be benched) or more time to come on as a substitute. We get into good positions to put balls in the box with Darmian and especially Shaw and there aren't many better than Chicharito to get on the end of them.

45~~~
We never should have let him go last season really, would have been better off keeping him instead of getting falcao or even better then what RvP did most likely. His pace and movement in behind is a great bonus to have.

46~~~
Holy shit I just love seeing him here in a United shirt again.  Warms the heart.  Just having his enthusiasm back after watching Di Maria and the likes last season is great. Here's hoping he'll get the chances to impress and he'll get back to scoring for fun again.

47~~~
Delighted to see him back too. Delighted, also, that his first touch seems to have improved. With Rooney failing to impress so far, we might be seeing plenty of this guy this season. Hopefully he shows his worth.

48~~~
Very nice little cameo. His touch was good, his energy was excellent. Looks sharp.

49~~~
Realistically Rooney should be third in the pecking order up front. At this point both Hernandez and Fellaini are better strikers, depending on what kind of game we want to play.

Today's game also made me realize that we aren't so much in dire need of another striker as we are in dire need of growing the balls to drop Rooney when he deserves to be dropped. Bringing in a world class forward would be great, but Fellaini and Chicharito are decent options that deserve a fair shot, even if they don't whip the transfer muppets into a frenzy.

50~~~
Maybe I've been watching Rooney for too long but I was impressed by some Chicharitos touches.

Hernandez actually looked like a good footballer, to the point where I saw him get the ball out wide and I didn't expect him to feck it up like he would have in the past. Fancy that.

51~~~
Yeah he looked sharp. He didn't seem too happy to come on though. Or maybe I was just distracted by his hair and have made this up.

52~~~
He was up for it and think must have really loved the reception he got. His tenacity is what led to the red and he definitely was giving their defense something else to think about. Think if LVG shows some confidence in him, he'll bang in 10-12 goals this season for us minimum.

53~~~
His hair was looking good. He looks just less baby-ish than I remember. A year in Madrid must have helped, or maybe Ronnie lent him his hairdresser.

54~~~
Looked lively, showed a good and confident touch and held the #9 line better than Rooney.

55~~~
Loads of movement and energy, pulled the Brugge defence around much more than Rooney. Praying he stays.

56~~~
With a system we shall be playing, he can really be our no.2 and the way Rooney is currently playing, I do not mind seeing him get some game time. With intelligent players like Depay, Mata and hopefully Pedro behind him, he will get good opportunities. He might have a Fellaini-Young (from last season) transformation this season.

57~~~
He definitely looked better than Rooney. His movement seems to have improved and his link up play as well; something I noticed the few times I watched him play for Real last season. I hope he starts the away game as I dont see LVG dropping Rooney for the game this weekend.

58~~~
Couldn't agree with you more. He got a great reception when he came on and was full of running. His enthusiasm is infectious and I hope he gets more playing time this season, he could easily grab 10+ goals if used effectively.

59~~~
His shirt looked too big on him. Not sure about the hair too.

60~~~
Not only did he look good, but Rooney looked happy to play behind him and get on the ball after he came on.

He gives Van Gaal a different option up front especially if we face a side that tries to play a high line against us.

61~~~
What's his current contract situation?

62~~~
Got a great reception when he came on, must have lifted him even more. 

So glad he's back.

63~~~
Expires next summer.

64~~~
I think his contract expires at the end of this season. 

I expect he will be looking for a club where he can start regularly after that.

65~~~
Oh dear. Sign him up.

66~~~
No more than Fellaini, Hernandez looked like a lad that was chomping at the bit on the sideline right before he came on. He looked like he was out to try prove a point and from the little time he had to do it I think he did a fairly good job.

67~~~
Just played like the usual Hernandez. Which isn't bad, I honesty think him and Rooney could have(had) a great partnership

68~~~
Really feel like the lad could get the magical 20 odd goals a season if given a stretch of games as the starting number 9. He is generally limited aesthetically but his movement, anticipation, and finishing is up there with the very best.

69~~~
Start him against Newcastle.

70~~~
Gets my vote

71~~~
More of a threat than Rooney in behind, deserves a chance thats for sure. Especially so if we aren't getting anyone else for that central strikers role.

72~~~
Told you <a class="username" data-user="23455, @Dobba" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23455/">@Dobba</a>
i watched few of his games as Madrid player & national team player last year and was sunrised as well. His first touch has improved. not Messi or Suarez' level but certainly he doesn't look like a pub player anymore.

 If we don't sign any striker this season, Fellaini and Chicharito could be our secret weapons.

73~~~
Not surprising that's he looked lively. He did very well for Madrid last season. I wouldn't mind him featuring a fair bit this season if he performs at that level. Could provide us something Rooney right now isn't.

74~~~
I really want to see him play more. I would love it if he returned to his debut season form.

75~~~
We want more Chico Time! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

76~~~
I am afraid you are mistaken. LVS will most likely never bench Rooney. However, it would be bonkers not to play Chicha more often, but who am I to lash out on the boss (at least this early in the season).

77~~~
LVG has a job to do. I understand Rooney is captain and LVG has admitted this gives him a privileged position, so he is less likely to be dropped, but I'd have to believe, if Rooney continues to play well below par, he is droppable.

78~~~
Yep. Instantly reminded me of how we looked in the second half in 10/11, when we made it to the champions league final. Hernandez with his pace pushing defenders back, giving Rooney space to get on the ball and run into space and drive the team forward. With Memphis on the left as well, and Mata on the right, some great quality as well. I hope Van Gaal gives him a fair chance because I think he can definitely have a big impact on our season like he did under Fergie all those times. It's not like pushing Rooney to #10 keeps somebody out either, that spot is there for the taking and IMO it's between Herrera, Januzaj, Pereira, Fellaini and Hernandez to make that last spot in the team their own, and force us to play slightly different systems, whether it's a proper #10 like Januzaj/Pereira, 3 midfielders like Herrera, a target man like Fellaini or a pacier striker like Hernandez.

79~~~
Let's make it happen. May as well give it a go. Will certainly give Rooney the space he needs to thrive. Plus with Memphis starting to look threatening, defenders will feel that he's more of a danger man than Rooney which will give even more room for the latter.

80~~~
He seemed "well-rounded", looked like he added something to his game at Real. He cant be much worse than Rooney, so why not give him a try

81~~~
Dammit - another one!

82~~~
I thought that too. I've always like Chicharito ever since that weird goal he scored against the renties at Wembley. Hope we hang on to him.

83~~~
Playing for a year in Madrid makes you more shiny and slightly more important-looking.

84~~~
Hope he features this season.  Has plenty to offer.

85~~~
His cameo was a pleasant surprise. Looked very good on the ball and was a handful for the opponent in physical battles.

86~~~
If we do not buy another striker then we are relying on Chicarito to play a major role for us this season. Looked good last night

87~~~
Looked sharp and his touch looked good. He should be coming of the bench more in games to actually show what he can do. For now, persist with Rooney but if his form carries on then we should be putting Hernandez in and giving him a fair chance.

88~~~
Can't believe this bum is still on the payroll here.

I'd much rather we got rid and gave Wilson the chance, or spend big on Lewandowski.

89~~~
He's far better than Wilson.

90~~~
-----------------------De Gea
Darmian-----Smalling---Blind------Shaw

Goals, Goals, Goals...

91~~~
Hernandez should get a run of games as our main striker to see if he is an improvement on Rooney. I suspect he might be as he would give us pace up front.

92~~~
Not a fan of the Lesbian haircut, but besides that he was OK. Wouldn't mind giving him a run if Rooney continues to shoot blanks (or even failing to shoot for that matter).

93~~~
He appears to have bought himself that first touch he never had, happy days.

94~~~
Anyone else think he should/could start today? We looked a better team with him leading the line. Far more active and it seemed like all of our players had more options with the runs he was making.

95~~~
I'd be excited if he starts, have a soft spot for Chicha.

96~~~
I don't think he will start, but I wouldn't mind it. That said, I think he'll be given 20-30 minutes as a sub to continue to build his fitness after his cameo against Brugge.

97~~~
Should, I don't see why not? Will he? Nope. Not a chance in hell he's getting starts at all unless Rooney is injured.

98~~~
fecking hell.

99~~~
We'd be a better team with Chicha up front.

Januzaj Mata Memphis
-------- Hernandez

100~~~
that's harsh to the point of ridiculous.

101~~~
Of course it is. Chicha has never done anything to suggest he shouldn't be at United. He may not get the first team action he craves but if he's happy to be second fiddle he's an incredible option to have in he squad.

102~~~
Feck me some on here are deluded it's not even funny.

103~~~
Really should have scored that last chance. Looked sharp though.

104~~~
Should have scored that chance. A bit disappointed in how he didn't chip it but maybe everything happened a bit too fast for him to stay composed.

105~~~
Nah, Krul pulled off a great save. Can't fault him for missing that chance.

106~~~
Should have scored but looked lively.

107~~~
Looked better than Rooney has all season. Just occupying the central defenders makes such a difference to our overall play.

Should have scored the chance but you know Rooney would never have been quick enough on to that ball in the first place. Next time it's in.

108~~~
He gave Mata something to aim at. His movement will improve the performance of the three in behind him if he takes Rooney's place (lol)

109~~~
Had to score that sitter, no wonder why we can't sell him

110~~~
He missed that chance but he looked pretty energetic inside the box

111~~~
I say we give him a run of games. Would have scored that chance today otherwise. It can't be any worse than what Rooney is serving up at the moment which is nothing.

112~~~
You are fast becoming one of the worst posters on here

113~~~
Do my eyes deceive me, or has the year at Madrid done wonders for his interplay, first touch and control? the ball doesn't bounce off him anymore.

114~~~
I agree. Just give him a chance as I've said. Needs some match play and think he will link up well with Mata.

115~~~
It is bouncing off Rooney instead, maybe a loan to Madrid will fix it. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

116~~~
Bummed he didn't score that chance. Would have put your house on him slotting that a few seasons ago.

117~~~
Should start the next game. very encouraging cameo

118~~~
Start him over Rooney. If only to show Rooney he has competition for his place.

119~~~
the trouble is that Hernandez is a bit average

120~~~
Rooney and Hernandez have always had a good understanding, I think he deserves the start.

121~~~
Really happy with it. He had his back to goal, didn't dwell on the ball, was able to play some first touch football. Rooney would stay on the ball way too long, and that's why bugs me most about him. He's often flat footed, relies on his physical frame instead of thinking a little quicker. Chica just <i>worked, </i>plain and simple. Whether or not Rooney is a <i>better </i>player is beside the point; at present, Chica is a very viable and worthy alternative to Rooney.

122~~~
Shame he didn't score. Did well to get it out of his free and shoot, Krul reacted excellently. Statistically had we given Hernandez three chances in that game he'd have scored. Sad the other chances didn't come from our boring approach.

123~~~
Chicha has done much much better than Wayne today. It was one hell of a save by Krull, but at least Chicha did burst into the area and did take a shot.

124~~~
We are capable of dominating possession regardless of who are forward is and what our link up players need is a striker with pace/movement which he has in abundance. The side doesn't need a striker who wants to be a 10 or who always needs the ball into feet. The threat of Hernandez running in behind takes advantage of Mata's passing range and creates more space for our support players like Memphis/Adnan. His raw attributes alone merit a start in the current set up.

125~~~
I'd start him over Rooney next game. His touch has improved, he has some speed and is more active than Rooney.

126~~~
Yeah he seems a lot more confident on the ball. Personally think we should try him up top for a game, even if he doesn't get a goal his willingness to run in behind opens up space.

127~~~
Buzzed around, looked sharp, moved it quickly and got a half chance that was met with some good keeping from Krul.

128~~~
I hope LvG won't ignore the energy Hernandez provided but I have a feeling he only sees the missed chance.

129~~~
Looks very good to me. I guess I've forgotten about that. Welcome back Chicharito.

130~~~
Should have scored.

131~~~
Hernandez has to play I think. Rooney in this form and Adnan are not going to score enough goals. Unlucky with the chance he had but in the two games he's come on and looked sharp.

132~~~
If I were LVG I would give him a start on Wednesday. Just needs to play more to get more clinical in front of goal. He definitely gives us more in the last two appearances he's made. Shame he couldn't score today.

133~~~
I want to see him start. He actually tried to speed up our passing with quick one-twos and was unlucky not to score.

134~~~
I actually think he and Fellaini together would be a good combo tbh.

135~~~
He looks like he's really improved his overall game. When he come on, he didn't play on the last man, he dropped quite a lot and got involved in our build up play, which suggests to me that Van Gaal doesn't mind his striker dropping, just as long as someone goes in behind when he does. 

Actually, there was a prime example of that when he dropped off, and Rooney ran in behind, which resulted in a Rooney volley. Unfortunately, the shot was blocked, but I guess that's what Van Gaal wants to see. When Rooney dropped off, we didn't have anyone to run in behind.

136~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

137~~~
Love this kid. His movement always presents opposing defenders with a huge headache. Thought he took his chance well, but was just upstaged by Krul. I would gladly start him where Wazza is at and put Wazza in the 10 spot.

138~~~
He looked lively when he came on and was a part of the urgency which was evident at the end of the game from you but has no excuses for missing his chance. He had time to quickly flick it to his right if he wanted to or loft it rather than what he did.

139~~~
I think everyone forgot how good a player Hernandez actually is over the last year. Should be coming into his peak now too.

140~~~
Linked up well, looked lively in the box and reacted incredibly well just to make a chance out of the situation. Decent finish as well but Krul pulled off a good save.

He keeps the CBs on their toes and that alone makes him worthy of consideration for a starting place based on the options we have.

141~~~
He should start next game, Rooney as striker isn't working and he is our only other option.

142~~~
I agree with starting him next game,  but as long as Rooney is around, I can't see it happening unfortunately.

143~~~
Not really sure why the clamour for Hernandez to start the next game?

As a sub striker who feels he should be starting, you have to be putting away the chance that fell to him today. At this level, you get a chance and you have to take it.

144~~~
He's 27.

145~~~
Exactly cause he got into that chance. Played like a CF, didn't wandered around but waited for his chance or even half chance to score. Sure he missed, Krul made a nice save but nevertheless you expect your CF to be on the end of those deflected balls.

146~~~
Ok that's fair enough. Rooneys refusal to be disciplined in his position is an issue. I'm not convinced Hernandez is the answer though. Krul had gone down quite early and with the time he had, a true finisher lifts that over his leg.

147~~~
Was unlucky not to score today, had what was probably the best chance of the match where Krul made an excellent save. Not convinced he's shown enough to get a start in the next game, though.

148~~~
Well I don't know if he's a answer but we should try it. Many wont agree but I wouldn't even be against Rooney at nr. 10 with Chicharito up front. He's a predator, he could score from half a chance and he's always somewhere in the dangerous area. As I said he plays like a proper CF.

149~~~
Really? The worst part about Rooney this season has been his overall play - he's looked incredibly lethargic and sluggish a lot of the times, which is why we've largely been hoping that he can at least score some goals up front. I don't think Rooney's anywhere near good enough at the moment to be a provider/playmaker, or whatever we want him to be, in the number 10 role. If we're playing Hernandez, I think it'd make more sense to just drop Rooney for him.

150~~~
He has if Rooney is the benchmark.

151~~~
Its like because of the Moyes reign everyone just thought he was a shite player all of a sudden and forgot all the things he can offer us. His work rate, off the ball movement and generally his physical attributes like pace and his leap should have him getting loads of games. Really hope he starts the next game because these 2 sub appearances have been really encouraging from him IMO. Just needs faith put into him and he'll start putting away those chances again.

152~~~
Please don't say that word around here, we already have a player who supposedly has and it ain't good. Wouldn't wish it on anybody.

153~~~
Really hope he sticks around, his reflexes in the box will be invaluable. He's good enough to get plenty of minutes.

154~~~
It is a bit of a poisoned chalice because it assumes consistency. If your game drops for one game, you're 'past it'.

155~~~
I would be interested to see how he does from the start. I don't think this system suits strikers who don't have that sharpness about their games; van Persie, Falcao and now Rooney all look a yard off it.

Hernandez's pace and movement might be useful in this respect.

However, I still wouldn't be overly surprised to see him move on if we sign a striker in the next eight days, though I think it would make more sense to loan Wilson out to go and play 40 odd games in the Championship if that was the case.

156~~~
Don't know why he didn't dink it over Krul though I suppose it all happened so quickly.

157~~~
That's fair, provided the striker keeping him out of the team is going the business. That isn't the case though.

158~~~
Going away from goal, on his weaker foot, at speed, with two defenders behind him, I think he did the right thing just getting the shot off quickly. If I have any criticism its that he needed to leather it, but even so Krul reacted really fast to close the angle and get down to the ball.

159~~~
Happened very quickly. Was on his weaker foot too.

It's not like he's missed the target or hit it at Krul. He forced a very good save from him.

160~~~
Just needs game time IMO. Would be very good for us with Mata always looking to play damaging passes because of his movement and pace. I'd prefer him up front rather than Rooney at the moment.

161~~~
I wish this whole "peak" generalisation business would stop. There is a very, very broad trend in certain positions but as far as individual players go they all peak at certain times. Look at Jonny Evans, at centre back who played his best football in his early 20's. Fabregas was arguably better in his late teens/early 20's than in his mid 20's while Pirlo you could argue was better at 34 than he was at 28.

It's such a daft thing to assume any player should be playing their best football during certain years. They play their best football when conditions are at best for them, be it youthful confidence and fitness or by using their experience. It could be due to a particular set up they play in, with particular players, under a particular manager or it could just be that they hit a point in their life where the external trappings of being a footballer no longer appeal to them and they are able to focus on improving themselves as a player instead. The whole idea that there is a particular age that a player or type of player in particular positions come into their peak is just stupid.

162~~~
Solid post Pex.

163~~~
*Physical peak

164~~~
His reaction after that shot/save really said everything that could be said about that save.

165~~~
1 game?!?? More like 10 and were still hoping

166~~~
There is though. There are exceptions but it's far more common for players to improve in their early 20s, peak in late 20s and decline from around 30 or so. I don't need to list examples because there are thousands.

167~~~
And there's thousands of examples of players who are better from 18-24 than they are in their late 20's and players that have great twilights after being average in their mid twenties. It's a generalisation.

Pick 3 random names out of a hat and look at their best back to back seasons and I guarantee you they'll all have a different "peak" age.

168~~~
Well unless we actually went through thousands we wouldn't come to a conclusion and I'm sure neither of us want to do that. I'm positive there are more who peak 25-30 than 18-24, given the number of players who don't even make the first team in their teens or early twenties, or players who are playing in lower leagues at that age but make steps up later on. There are other factors as well as you rightly pointed out, and it is a generalization to say that Hernandez could be approaching his peek years but I think it's a fair assumption as long as it's not taken too literally.

At the end of the day we have a 27 year striker with a proven goal scoring record in the PL and at international level. He hasn't had injury concerns, he isn't likely to burn out from years of over playing or physically developing earlier like some players. The big ifs are - If he is willing and motivated, and if he can fit in with the way the team are playing and the role required of him, - but if he is then I see no reason why he shouldn't be expected to perform to a high level - as high as we have seen from him so far and maybe even higher.

169~~~
Which are just some of the reasons I highlighted as to why players have different peaks. If the conditions aren't right for him, which I'd argue that they are not right now, then he's going to have trouble motivating himself and finding his way into the side.

170~~~
Been impressed every time he's come on this season and thought he was unlucky not to get on the score sheet today. Will grab us a fair few this year I think.

171~~~
ffs little pea

172~~~
He's not good at penalties, so not sure what was going on there

173~~~
That look between Van Gaal and Giggs said it all. His football career just ended...

174~~~
That made me sad <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

175~~~
erm no. He's an average player

176~~~
You could tell he was gonna miss that. He look bizarrely knackered/nervy for someone who's only been on the pitch for 10 minutes in an easy romp.

177~~~
I'm not just saying this because of the pen miss, but he doesn't look up for this at all. He's not putting in any effort in his runs or chasing the ball. Is he off?

178~~~
Oh come on, our entire club is shit at penalties. This changes nothing.

179~~~
Dreadful penalty. A shame, since a goal would've done him a lot of good.

180~~~
I thought exactly the same.

181~~~
Feel for him, he really needs a goal.

182~~~
So so unlucky.

183~~~
He managed to simultaneously disqualify the penalty for a double contact, slip while taking it, and miss it anyway, all in the one go. Impressive.

184~~~
LvG and Giggsy's look after was <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

185~~~
He looks a broken man these days. Pretty sad to see. 

Terrible miss just now too.

186~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

187~~~
Good grief! We definitely DO need a striker...

188~~~
He's shit.

189~~~
Blimey!

190~~~
Err what's happened to our fox in the box?

191~~~
Come on Chicha, bloody hell!

192~~~
Another easy chance missed. Really not at the races tonight.

193~~~
Heskeyesque

194~~~
100%. He's given up. That's what the look was all about - it was his lackadaisical attitude that filtered through to the penalty. He had one moment that made it clear as day he didn't give two shits about this game.

195~~~
Lets not make it he has been like that since the beginning of the season. Poor tonight but looked better in previous games.

196~~~
See ya Chicha <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

197~~~
Should've used his face.

198~~~
Not doing himself any favours tonight. Suspect Fellaini will get the next striking sub appearance

199~~~
Just be thankful the misses are insignificant, severely lacking in confidence...

200~~~
He looks absolutely miserable.

201~~~
We're selling him?

202~~~
It's a real shame since he always looked so enthusiastic and delighted to be playing for us in his early days here.

203~~~
Jesus wept, what happened to the Chich that used to get such big goals against Chelsea?

204~~~
Just hope that convinces LVG that we need another striker.

205~~~
He has the Torres look of being depressed. I feel like he's going to breakdown anytime soon.

206~~~
Jesus welp, he can probably pack his shit after this match, like if the van Gaal death stare wasn't enough after the penalty he had to feck up this sitter, feel for him.

207~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

208~~~
Two very bad misses in two games and that's not even counting the penalty.

Awful.

209~~~
It was club Brugge

<span style="color: #ffffff">Lol</span>

210~~~
Well, that didn't go well tonight

211~~~
Shadow of himself and horribly off form.

212~~~
I have no doubt

213~~~
My MoM.

214~~~
Wow, just wow.. could be last time we see him in a United shirt. That was truly awful!

215~~~
Had two chances to prove himself, fecked them both up. Probably third choice going forward.

216~~~
Don't think we'll see him again for a while after that.

217~~~
Well if it's true we must buy a new striker first.

218~~~
Like the guy, but there's no real hiding from a performance like that. Piss poor.

219~~~
Clearly doesn't give a feck about being here anymore.

220~~~
Bless his little cottons

221~~~
looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders. no smiles, no energy. He doesn't want to be here at all.

222~~~
feel for him but he needs to score, three 1000% chances 0 goals, the only thing he brought back to Manchester from Real seems the gelled hair which is quite disgusting, well we need striker it seems

223~~~
He needs to wrapped in klingfilm and headbutted repeatedly in the testicles.

224~~~
Sad watch that

225~~~
At least he's getting into the positions ...

Don't think he's getting sold either as we don't have anybody else.

226~~~
Oh come on  why exaggerate like this. He was fine in previous games. He had a night off and all of a sudden it's he doesn't want to be with us...

227~~~
He looks short on confidence and not player who always had a smile on his face during SAF era.

228~~~
Yeah, he was such a happy chap under Fergie. Wouldn't be surprised if Giggs has convinced LvG to give him another chance; that look between them certainly suggested so.

229~~~
Wasn't his night. Hopefully is doesn't knock him too much.

230~~~
He don't have same level of confidence he had before.

231~~~
Will probably be kicking himself after those misses.....

I say probably because he'd more than likely miss

232~~~
It wasn't just the chances he missed, the ball ran under his foot when Rooney set him off down the wing

233~~~
? He looked distraught.

234~~~
They just keep on giving reasons to find better strikers.

235~~~
Couldn't finish a colouring book tonight.

236~~~
Yeah fine it was, but a couple of goals and he'd be brimming with confidence and LVG would have to think. I love the guy and want him to succeed but that was a stinker cameo sadly.

237~~~
He had a John Terry penalty miss and a Torres like miss in less than ten minutes

238~~~
Wilson take his place on the bench for next game.

239~~~
Was desperate for him to score

Clearly very rusty, felt pretty damn sorry for him in the end


Can still be very important, hope Lvg doesn't kill him

240~~~
He is awfully short on confidence, LVG doesn't trust him. Needs a hand around his shoulder at this point.

241~~~
It's all about the body language and he's looked genuinely unhappy ever since he came back. Really sad to see.

242~~~
He needs a Fergie to help him get his confidence back. When you have no confidence you force things (happens in every sport), and that's where he's at right now. Frustrating, but needs games.
If I were him I would ask to play with the reserves, just to get those nerves out.

243~~~
Just had a bad day when it didn't really matter

244~~~
I don't think that. He just had an off game.

245~~~
Yeah no biggie though a shame he didn't lift his head up after the peno. Hasn't the confidence by the look of it. 

Would be great to see Wilson or Lingard get more game time though. Ideally he would move but we would clearly have to bring someone in. He is a good player but not ideal for him to be with us now.

246~~~
His finishing was deteriorating before he left, I remember a few missed sitters towards the end of his first spell here and then he missed a few more at the World Cup. He doesn't look much better going off the last few games.

If he's not scoring he adds nothing.

247~~~
I think he needs to move on for his own good. To a club that will give him much more game time than the likes of us or Madrid.

248~~~
He's been shit for two years and looks to be carrying it on for a third. Get rid.

249~~~
Not a great cameo for Hernandez.

250~~~
Missed a great chance on Saturday and should have had two tonight, I think it might make Van Gaal reconsider his transfer plans.

251~~~
He's just rubbish on the ball and always has been. His movement is so good he could probably also make a career in handball, even if he's as bad at throwing as he is at shooting.

252~~~
So thats three open chances in the last two games, and he's missed them all. Need to offload him asap.

253~~~
Spent too much time with Ramos, not only very alike penalty taking technique but he looks like a fecking guido now too.

254~~~
I don't agree that it's likely we'll leave. If we don't add anyone new, it'll be useful to still have him. Terrible game for him today, but I do think he can turn it around and hopefully score a few goals for us over the course of the season.

255~~~
He's looked unhappy every second he's played this season

256~~~
Seems to have lost the joy in his game. Everything seems labored right now. His build up has definitely improved, just needs a few goals under his belt and get his mojo back.

257~~~
He needs games to get back to his best, but he's not going to get them here unfortunately. We should really sell him if we aren't going to play him.

258~~~
He isn't going anywhere unless we bring in a new striker. 

There's absolutely no chance the club will play a season with rooney and Wilson as our only proper strikers.

259~~~
He looks like his cat just died.

260~~~
Why all this body language stuff?

261~~~
After he missed the penalty;

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/n0gv" width="560"></iframe>

Looks pretty damning when put with this post from the pre-match thread on reddit:

<i>According to Korean commentators it's Giggs, and not LVG, that has been recommending Chicharito and trying to get him playtime. First time I've ever heard this, anyone know more?</i>

No idea if this is true at all, but it seems to add up.

EDIT: just realised there's a whole thread on this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

262~~~
This time last week people said he deserved to be starting ahead of Rooney after a half-decent cameo against Brugge.

Now he should be on the first plane out of Manchester.

Some people really do take 'You're only as good as your last game' to the extreme.

If we keep him, we know exactly what we'll be getting: a quick, lively, energetic striker with a knack for scoring goals off the bench. The same old Hernandez, basically.

If he's prepared to play that role, then it's great to have him here, and he'll win us more than a few points over the season.

263~~~
Sadly won't be going anywhere given our lack of attacking reserves.

  But I think he has gone off the club - he is not happy to be there and is paranoid about LVGs lack of faith in him.

264~~~
Hopeless tonight and clearly unhappy and horribly out of form.

In general though he just doesn't offer enough. Can't lead the line or link up play. He's only here because we couldnt sign whoever else we wanted when RVP and Falcao were shipped out.

265~~~
Well, we have a new leader in the 'needs a goal to regain his confidence' table

266~~~
None of this makes him a bad player. Not having that. But if LVG doesn't fancy him he would be better off elsewhere and we should be in for Berahino.

267~~~
Imagine if he did the same with Rooney? Chico will come good for us.

268~~~
The less said about that cameo the better.

269~~~
A poor game tonight, nothing more to it than that as he looked lively in his previous brief appearances.

270~~~
As much as we like him, we really do, but he has to slot those chances in to boost his confidence and show LVG that he can be counted on. After today's game, I wouldn't be surprised if we see another forward coming in.

271~~~
This. It's always black or white. He looked lively in previous games, one bad game and he's unhappy and doesn't want to be with us.

272~~~
His positioning is still pretty good.

273~~~
C'mon it was a bad day, nothing more.  The penalty was a shame and the missed chance was one of those fizzed crosses that are difficult to keep down - Memphis missed an arguably easier one last week. 

Frankly he's a proven goalscorer on every level.  Despite a lack of playing time he pretty much scored every time he played for Madrid.  He's scored dozens of goals for us over the past few seasons.  Whether or not he's worth keeping shouldn't be based on today's peformance - it should simply be based on whether we need this type of player.  Right now given our lack of options, I say we absolutely do.  He'll score many more than he'll miss.

274~~~
Some are being overly harsh in this thread IMO. He had a bad night, just as Rooney has had a bad time leading up to this game. Now is not the time to be bring out the pitchforks, he may be our only option next to Rooney for the season. He needs support.

275~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/video" width="560"></iframe>

276~~~
The penalty was a bad miss but i'll let him off since his foot slipped, but he should be burying that other easy chance he ballsed up. Not the best of cameos .

277~~~
Most know he made a mistake going Madrid. That put a bit of distance between him and United supporters. Not concerned. You get games like that but get them when you're winning handsomely.

278~~~
I still have confidence in him. You don't lose the knack of goalscoring he has. Like Rooney needs confidence in himself. I thought it was great management to get him on at a time when we would get chances to try and get him of the mark.

279~~~
It is, you're right. His movement is fine, just seems to have lost his confidence at the club. 

I'm still not convinced he'll be here this time next week. Of course he will if we don't sign another striker, but still think there's a chance we will and he'll be off.

280~~~
Didn't think he was terrible myself, just unlucky. His movement was really good and he showed some good link-up play. Slipped and missed the penalty - unfortunate but did send the keeper the wrong way. Would have been a good pen had he not lost his footing. The second chance was the big miss, did really well to get into that position but should have scored.

Nonetheless, looked a threat when Brugge had given up the ghost. Shows good pace and his running in behind gets defenders backtracking. Still think he could play a key role for us this season and hope he continues to get game time.

281~~~
Bad luck with the penalty and the chance at the end wasn't as easy at it looked. The ball flew in a pace and those things can end up anywhere. He looked like a player bereft of confidence but that can be cured.

282~~~
Important thing for me is that he keeps getting into the positions and keeps making the runs. Always trying.

283~~~
This is a bit ridiculous. He misses a couple of chances and he should suddenly be shipped out? How about the numerous awful games Rooney had? Is no wonder he looks disheartened, Rooney can play awfully for months yet still be guaranteed starting spot but Hernandez is crucified for missing a few chances, which to be honest can happen to any striker, especially ones that are lacking match fitness/sharpness due to minimal playing minutes... He needs a run in the team but thus will never happen due to rooneys position. I'm happy at least he got into these goal sorting positions tonight and against Newcastle. If he played 90 minutes more often he probably would have gotten into these positions even more and that would lead to higher chances of scoring and add to confidence etc. I feel sorry for the guy.

284~~~
Not sure I agree that its the same ole Hernandez. When he first joined he was pretty clinical. His finishing and general confidence in front of goal has noticeably deteriorated in the last couple of seasons IMO.

285~~~
Exactly, the sort of night any striker can have. As long as he doesn't make a habit of it we should be able to see past it.

The only question is will he get the game time to build his confidence? 20 minutes here and there and cup games seem to be all he will get, unless there is an injury to Rooney, and its going to be difficult for him to build any rhythm on that basis.

286~~~
The Hernandez of old would've buried that chance. Give him time, I'm sure with some more minutes under his belt he will score some goals.

287~~~
Not surprised at this performance as I have seen it before when he has played for Mexico and Manchester United. He is not going to improve as long as he keeps playing second fiddle to other strikers. 

He needs a club that will make him their primary striker. A club like Crystal Palace, or Leciester might be a good move for him if he wants to stay in England.

288~~~
I don't like him. Hope he's sold

289~~~
Bad performance but it can happen to anyone. At least he got in to good positions which is more than you could say for Rooney during much of his dry spell.

290~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if it's Giggs who has had a word with Van Gaal about taking a closer look at Hernandez and giving him more chances this season. Van Gaal was quick to loan him out last season and not much has changed since then. Three excellent chances to score this season, and all were poorly taking and are signs of a player whose confidence is very low.

There's hope for him, though. The most positive aspect of his play is his movement which has been class and I think we should stick with him as back up. He's not done too badly and if we utilise him in the same way we did in 12/13, then he'll flourish. Obviously it depends on Van Gaal who has shown his ruthless side this summer, so we'll soon find out if he deems him good enough as back up.

291~~~
Why are people pretending that this is his first bad game? 

He's been shit since Fergie retired. I don't know what's happened to him, but everything he offered, he no longer offers. He used to be great at finding little pockets of space in the area, snatching chances out of nowhere, and putting the ball in the back of the net by any means necessary. Now, he's either offside or looking like he couldn't hit a barn door. 

His goal scoring record at Madrid wasn't bad, but when you consider how freely they score, it was still pretty poor. 9 in 33 doesn't look shabby, but he scored 6 of those in games that Madrid dominated, and subsequently battered the opposition. The only goals of note he scored came against Atletico in the CL quarters, and Celta Vigo in the league. They clearly didn't want to keep him, not even as back-up.

You can potentially write off the Moyes season because everyone was shit, but there's no denying that Hernandez was shit during that time either. He's been pretty shit for Mexico for quite a while now too.

I think Hernandez was excellent under Fergie, but for whatever reason, he's just not up to the standard we need anymore. We're relying on a guy that can't buy a goal, hopefully finding some form from 3 seasons ago. It's all well and good saying he needs game time, but he's made 88 club appearances and 31 international appearances since the start of 2013. If he needs more than 110 games in 2 and half years to remember how to do more than stand offside and miss sitters, then we could be in for a long wait.

I'm all for sentimentality when it comes to charity events and testimonials, but when we've got ambitions of being a title challenging side again, we can't afford passengers.

292~~~
That look from LVG.

Sorry little pea, but I think this is the end.

293~~~
Not a good run out for him and he doesn't look like the cheery little chap he used to be, still, I think his spot is safe for this season.

294~~~
He was god awful tonight

295~~~
Needs to move I think. Doesn't look happy, and that is a real shame.

296~~~
It's weird. When he came on, I didn't even see him as our player. He doesn't look happy either.

297~~~
I wouldn't be happy either missing those chances! On another night he bags 3 and that was coming on as a sub!

298~~~
He looks unhappy and old.

299~~~
On another night he gets a hatrick from a subs appearance! Yet he can't buy a goal? I mean come on to feck! His touch yes or link up play feel free to criticise but the one thing we all know about him is he's good for a goal!!

300~~~
I think he will score goals for us and with just him and rooney in the squad, am sure he will get plenty of game-time for him to be happy.
His body language was weird today. Seemed unhappy, not sure why.

301~~~
He's simply not good enough and for some reason doesn't have the killer instinct around the box that he had for us years ago.

And I don't buy the whole, "well he gets into good positions" - that doesn't mean shit if you're terrible at finishing.

I'd much rather have Wilson be the 2nd striker to Rooney, it's really a no-brainer in my opinion.

302~~~
I think 1 bad match doesn't make him a terrible finisher. We put up with Welbeck for so long expecting him to get better on his finishing skills and it never came.

303~~~
I believe that defences had grown used to him and his lack of talent is being exposed time and time again

304~~~
His misses today have nothing to do with defenses learning him. He was alone in front of goal.

If he stays (which I hope is going to happen), he will give us few important goals. He is not done yet even though he looks different from Hernandez of 2011.

305~~~
Ship him out. He's not up to the job and never has been. Never first choice for Fergie. Never first choice for Moyes. Never first choice for Ancelotti. Never first choice for Van Gaal. How much more evidence does anyone need?

306~~~
We don't need a first choice striker. We need a striker who is ready to play second fiddle to Rooney.

307~~~
Plenty of nonsense here. He looks rusty but still managed to get incredible chances. Everyone can have a bad day at the office but only at Manchester United will people call for your head after one bad appearance. Rooney went 10 games without a goal.

308~~~
He would be first choice if Rooney got a long term injury.

309~~~
If Rooney gets injured, we will struggle regardless whether we play Chicha, Wilson or Fellaini there.

310~~~
It's not just one game. He's not up to the job, pure and simple.

311~~~
So what you're saying is we wouldn't miss out if we sold him.

312~~~
I don't know what to think... On one hand, you could make the lack-of-game-time excuse for him, but it's not the first time I've seen him miss those sitters. I suppose it's just a vicious cycle with him, he desperately needs a goal from somewhere.

313~~~
Oh. Ok, then.

314~~~
Wayne went 10 games (starting all of them) and scored feck all. Chicha has not even played 90 mins, yet he is crap. I can tell that Chicha's runs and speed are pretty effective. Once he puts his shooting boots on, he will get his goals. He needs time and match rhythm, that is the only way for a striker to gain some sharpness. I am sure Van Gaal will not write the Little Pea off yet.

315~~~
Not exactly. I expect Chicha to become better (when compared to Wilson and Fellaini) if he gets a string of games. But as it stands, Chicha is a decent enough backup for us or off the bench player.

316~~~
That penalty, fair enough. But fluffing that cross from Young was some achivement

317~~~
He does not look like a happy man. Looks very depressed, I wish the best for him.

318~~~
I felt bad for him, on a regular day he'd have ended the game with a brace and cemented his status as the second striker. Now he has to watch his back for the next week or so.

319~~~
You cheeky bugger, you had that time travel machine all along, didn't yeah?

320~~~
It happens. He's low on confidence so he played the safe option. Sometimes they roll up on you and go over. A confident striker would hit that with their laces and put it through the netting.

321~~~
Hence called an opinion.. Not a fact <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

322~~~
Watch him score a goal in a game or 2 and suddenly he'll be happy to be with us, all smiles and good enough for 2nd choice striker.

323~~~
It wasn't just "chances".

It was a penalty and a four yard tap-in to an empty goal.

324~~~
Devilish I think you couldn't be more wrong. How can defences get used to someone with great movement. Plus there is a lot of new players playing since he last played!

325~~~
Great movement means little if one cannot control the ball and exploit/ create pockets of space he has/needs. The epl defenses are getting better each season and it's getting difficult for strikers to be effective especially when playing with big clubs. I cant see him succeed where the likes of Rooney, rvp and co had struggled

326~~~
It shows lack of confidence and increase in frustration. Hernandes has been in decline for years and a change of air hasn't help. Unfortunately with defenses getting meaner the likes of him who can only outpace the defender are becoming rare. No wonder why you barely see any goal poachers at top level anymore

327~~~
I feel his head isn't here and he probably doesn't want to be here. I didn't watch him much at madrid but against Atletico i saw him in the CPL, and he was absolutely buzzing he kept trying the whole match, and tbf he did miss one or two great chances, but he kept trying and eventually he scored. Yesterday, i felt he just stopped trying which isn't something you can say about Hernandez. I hope he finds his form soon because we are going to need every Striker we have and their goals due to lack of striking options.

328~~~
One bad game, nothing more to it, he is never going to be a starter and he knows  it.

329~~~
That's the harsh reality he faces. One-dimensional goal poachers like him just don't belong in the modern game. He could still be a great option off the bench but he seems to be a real confidence player and being marginalised seems to have messed with his head and affected his performances. He's not even poaching goals like he used to. Which is a problem, for him and for United.

330~~~
Has to be his last game for the club, surely.

I felt for him last night though, the little fella was so desperate to impress but it just wasn't to be. It'd be best for both parties to go our separate ways.

331~~~
Yeah, no.

332~~~
?

333~~~
I think Van Gaal was very generous towards him in his post game comments. Maybe he was in a good mood because we won, but Van Gaal seemed keen to laugh of Chico's slip. Unusual because the boss has blasted players after having good games, and the consensus is Chico was bad.

I only saw the highlights so I can't comment much. Still, even if he misses the penalty he's got to score from Young's cross. A toe poke puts that in. 

You can see how badly the other players want him to score. It's almost a Forlan situation where everyone loves him and wants him to succeed. Hope he can score soon though, for his sake.

334~~~
Been in more positions to score than Falcao did most of last season. Great for coming off the bench and maybe needs games in the 21's to get his sharpness back.

335~~~
Can't hide that he had a stinker. Still have faith in him though but not sure LVG  does anymore.

336~~~
Rio was right by saying after the game that even if he misses chances i.e the penalty, he still is very persistent and gets himself to the right positions. It's a great asset to have.

Was a bit shit with his finishing last night but he'll need a goal to get him going like Rooney. Seems a little short of confidence.

337~~~
Needs a shoulder around him...the management team need to show that they believe in him and I believe that the goals will come.

338~~~
If only it was possible to merge Welbeck and Chicarito. We would have a decent alternative to Rooney

339~~~
That's what I though yesterday too. He will be best sold to a club that will play him and he might enjoy his football again which he seems not to be doing right now. Could even be a mid-table side.

340~~~
Its what he should have done last season, but instead went to Madrid on loan. He has no one to blame but himself in that respect.

341~~~
To be fair an offer from Real Madrid has to be difficult to turn down.

Well then he can't think logically for his own career. He left for game time and then went to another team where he'd be a bench player, its not an excuse.

343~~~
But it was the best team in Europe and he was second choice there behind Benzema as opposed to fourth behind Rooney, van Persie and Falcao here.

344~~~
Fair to say he would have seen more game time under a different manager. Carlos ran that first team into the ground and it showed at the latter end of the season.

The best team in Europe that came 3rd in their league, I have never seen the champions league as the barometer of the best team in Europe. But I digress. He still didn't play as much, because of the lack of rotation. Even then players like Jese would have been higher up the pecking order.

"Kicker", the most important german newspaper when it comes to Football, reports, that Hernandez is off to Leverkusen. (They are not talking about rumours but maintain that it is a done deal.)

347~~~
Leverkusen? Is it nailed on that he'll be above Kiessling in the pecking order?

Goodbye Chicharito, and many thanks for the great memories!

Bye bye Chico! Thanks for the memories
