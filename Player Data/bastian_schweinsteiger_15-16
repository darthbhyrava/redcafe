World cup winner. Nice.

9~~~
Woohooo!

So, when is he going to get his first injury? I reckon 5th game in, torn hamstring, out for 2 months.

Ridiculous signing in a good way. Love the player, love the name. Been a fan for ages. Welcome to United. Will bring everything we need in our midfield. Crazy.

18~~~
MOTM in the final as well

Give him the No.7 shirt <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Can't believe it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> We're signing Schweinsteiger <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

22~~~
Great signing. Top class hardened professional with a wealth of experience, and serial winner as well. He might not be the young player we all wanted and thus probably won't play week in week out for us, but if we can draw 30 appearances out of him, then with his undoubted quality and leadership skills, then he can be hugely influential for us next season.

I expect though, that he will share the deep lying role with Carrick and only on occasions will play with him.

23~~~
LVG should make him the team captain...

24~~~
I'm going for some German beer tomorrow. Welcome Bastian!

25~~~
I'm not even going to dismiss the announcement, as it's so awesome.

26~~~
This is incredible! All hail Woody!

WTF! Send him back, we need to track his bleeding flight!

Wow <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

He's 31 in a few weeks so not exactly a long term solution, but just the kind of leader we need right now. Happy with this one <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

OMG OMG OMG!!!! Get in!!! Dream signing! Awesome news!!

43~~~
Woohoo!

44~~~
Best signing ever.

45~~~
Now this is a signing. Get in Woody.

46~~~
I actually met him for a few seconds last August at the Allianz when Bayern were showcasing their team for the coming season. I was wearing a United top and pointed to it asking him "Do you want to sign for United?" and he just laughed, then signed my shirt. But that's when the first seeds were planted in his mind.

So you can thank me for this one lads... <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

47~~~
Hard to not be happy with this despite the injury concerns. This place has an obsession with age. Luckily a player doesn't stop being of use the minute they're over 30.

48~~~
Cocks out! Hopefully he can have a good few injury free seasons with us <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Doesn't Woody know you're supposed to drag it out for another 6 weeks? Rubbish saga, 2/10. Not impressed.

59~~~
This thread is like the daerht yadhctam.

60~~~
What a signing. Top class pedigree, experienced, built of steel and mentally a beast!
Defo #1 choice for his position in the world for me.

61~~~
But you couldn't do the same for Muller? Mission failed.

62~~~
Last world cup winning midfielder signed was Kleberson right.

63~~~
I think he'll be exactly what we need when Carrick isn't available. Last season we weren't the same team without Carrick. This is where Schweini comes in. And you could always play both at the same time too. Great signing.

64~~~
Errr....What?

65~~~
Brilliant signing on paper

Woodward <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Well this is surprise, we've got ourselvese actual world class CM <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

68~~~
He's Canadian swine<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

69~~~
He didn't show his face unfortunately. I did the same to Neuer though and he said "I sign for you, but not Manchester". Bastard <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

70~~~
Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right
That's right I really love Schweinsteiger right
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat
I really love Schweinsteiger's feet, I really love Schweinsteiger's feet

71~~~
Old joke, never mind

72~~~
Exactly what we need in terms of experience and leadership with the talent. Excellent signing.

73~~~
Welcome, dude.

74~~~
Have no fear, <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> is just counterjinxing the premature thread creation jinx.

Reminiscent of the RVP signing, we want the league NOW!

76~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

77~~~
He's injury prone.

78~~~
Any new song for Bastian Schweinsteiger?

79~~~
Can't believe this.

80~~~
Class.

Did he take your autograph? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

81~~~
We're signing my favourite player in world football now that Scholes has retired. Just an unreal feeling.

82~~~
This feels so surreal. I guess I won't totally grasp the magnitude of what's happened here until I see him being presented in our kit. Such a happy day!

83~~~
Make in captain!

84~~~
Hopefully with Darmian!

85~~~
This really did escalate rather quickly.

The squad overhaul is going well if you ask me.

86~~~
Fans booing at the Bayern team presentation when our Schweiny is discussed. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

87~~~
While it's still awaiting confirmation, it's all but done and we can start to think about chants.

I hear they just chant "Fuβballgott" at him...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Tz2MeAjLCQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Also, for our German speakers, YouTube throws up a few songs in his honour. This one has 254,000+ views - DankeBasti.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpWXwLipxAs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

88~~~
I really do hope we use him carefully, manage his fitness and game time. Maybe pick between him and Carrick for that #6 role, so both get plenty of rest and hopefully reduce then risk of injuries, then maybe use both for the 'big' games?

If we're planning to use him every week, with the physicality and pace of the league, I think we're asking for trouble.

89~~~
Ah well, we dont need Neuer, we've got De Gea.








<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

90~~~
Get in, well done Woody !

91~~~
Fantastic news. He's the all action midfielder we have been missing since Keane left. Now on to Schniderlin Woody. Could he be our third signing before Monday?

92~~~
I keep thinking of this moment from two seasons ago after Schweinsteiger was sent off at Old Trafford.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eF5d1OfoaLo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

They're now team mates <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

93~~~
Unbelievable signing. Cracking addition by all accounts. Welcome to Manchester Basti.

94~~~
More proof that the press know very little but when shit gets done, Woodhard moves in like a ninja with swift, decisive action to get what he (Louis) wants.

95~~~
I'm guessing he'll be first choice for the Champions League games, with Carrick first choice for the league at least to start the season with.

96~~~
Absolutely delighted.

97~~~
Good job by the club. Big player, can see him having an impact ala pirlo for Juve. It will be incredible seeing him in the red of United.

98~~~
Mata doesn't count as midfielder?

99~~~
This

100~~~
Class signing but i worry about his injuries. We need him on the pitch, not yet another new project for our medical staff.

101~~~
This is so surreal, he's one of those dream signings I never thought we'd have <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

102~~~
OH MY GOD. YESSSSSSSS

103~~~
Any word on a fee?

104~~~
Can't remember if he was in South Africa or not, anyway you are ruining my joke!

105~~~
What the shit? I thought this was just tabloid news when I heard about early this morning. Now it's been announced by the club? Blimey.

Down to the important stuff. Squad number. Bin Evans and give him the 6?

106~~~
I just came

107~~~
Pfft, I only give mine out to United players <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

108~~~

109~~~
Good signing. He'll bring character and presence to the team in a way that Carrick can't, and he's definitely a man for the big occasion. Won't be at his lung-busting best or controlling games like he used to, but now we know we not only have a great alternative to Carrick for defensive midfield, but an extra midfielder for when we really want to further control games without sacrificing stability/balance (à la Mata). And of course, two masters of the deep-lying playmaking trade to pass on their knowledge to Blind, hopefully Schneiderlin, and possibly Verratti <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>.

110~~~
20m euros (~15m GBP) was reported yesterday by German media that broke the news.

111~~~
Still keeping up your image of the ultimate optimist

112~~~
This is so good! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

113~~~
Can't wait to see him in action. He will bring that slickness to us in midfield. Hope he remains fit, probably rotate with Carrick when needed

114~~~
Have wanted to see him in a United shirt since watching him play for Germany while on holiday circa 2007. Just awesome, so happy.

115~~~
Think Schweini may work well beside Carrick but if required, I can see Carrick moving into defence alongside Smalling when required for extra control too.

Re; squad number - Fellaini is 31 if Schweini wants brand continuity.

116~~~
Fußballgot! DIE TRANSFERMEISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

117~~~
Well it is inevitable. He missed 22 games last season, and 28 the year before.

118~~~
He is definitely going to be a plus for us in the Champions League.

119~~~
Our midfield will be amazing - can imagine Schweinsteiger - Schneiderlin - Herrera

120~~~
I'd certainly agree with that.

121~~~
Wtf. New low.

122~~~
Saw his name in the Manchester United forum on the home page thinking to myself, "that's not right."

123~~~
Great signing. Should hopefully give us at least three very good years.

Carrick/Bastain/Blind - 6
Bastian/Herrera - 8
Herrera/Fellaini - 10

Could potentially change to Schneiderlin instead of Herrera in the 8 position. 

<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

124~~~
You don't think he is? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

125~~~
Poor Schweini. Already in Manchester apparently. Will never have a classic flight tracking thread like Darmian now.

126~~~
Can somebody who knows what they are doing change that Bayern badge for a United one?

127~~~
Shopping at Aldi on this deal. German value at it's best. Fantastic signing.

I'm also a huge fan of that cheap cider they do there. Oh, and the garlic sausage. I might nip down myself this afternoon actually.

128~~~
Reports saying Woodward will meet with Schniderlin's reps today as well. Somebody calm him the feck down or there are going to be muppet craziness here!!

129~~~
Rummenigge told the press: “Bastian and I had arranged to meet after the summer holidays, to have a conversation. This took place yesterday. It was a very serious and detailed chat where we talked very honestly. He has informed me that he has been thinking in his holiday. He wants to end his career something new. He has asked me to respond to his request.

“We have responded to this request. The colleague from Manchester United has contacted me. We have agreed on a transfer.
“We tried to convince him to stay with Bayern Munich. But I also understand that a player who is 17 years at Bayern Munich, at the end of his career still want to gain a new experience. ”

“I regret that because Bastian extremely deserving player from us was how you have to say now. He was 17 years with us. He has passed through all stages. He has done great things. He has won everything. I told him that we will give him a great farewell match in Munich when he finishes his career. Whenever that will be. If he stops, we will also talk about whether there will be a future, a second career for him at Bayern.”

Look how quickly they sorted this out. They had a chat yesterday and the deal was all agreed and everything that same day. Real classy stuff from Bayern. 

And I hope this puts an end to the "they didnt him" brigade.

130~~~
I don't believe it

131~~~
But he played 28 games last season and 36 games the year before excluding internationals.
Last season after a gruelling summer and he was not alone because of that reason. Don't see how he missed 28 games in 2013/14

132~~~
You sign Milner we sign Schweinsteiger.

133~~~
Holy feck we actually signed Bastian schweinsteiger... All last night I was kind of thinking I'd wake up to it all being a lie and he announces he's staying.... And he actually signed! This is better then the rvp transfer a few years ago.

From Cleverly and fletcher at the start of last season, to Herrera, schweinsteiger, Carrick and probably schneiderlin.

134~~~

136~~~
New season can't come soon enough.

137~~~
Can't get the smile off my face

138~~~
The important question is what number he'll wear, given that Sideshow Bob has #31 nailed down.

139~~~
Great signing.

140~~~
Somewhere in a galaxy far far away, some zen master just sensed a disturbance in the force.

"As if millions of unborn children cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened".

141~~~
he looks great in the new kit 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://40.media.tumblr.com/85677ad06572ea1f954d7ef33cfc6e7b/tumblr_nrbrssCzCh1sgrkfyo1_1280.jpg" src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/85677ad06572ea1f954d7ef33cfc6e7b/tumblr_nrbrssCzCh1sgrkfyo1_1280.jpg"/> 

:P

142~~~
I'm just going on thats stats that I've seen on here.

If they're wrong, then I'll be delighted.

143~~~
You sign Delph we sign Schweinsteiger.

144~~~
I would love to be super muppet happy about this transfer, but i am worried about his injury record. I can't help it. Dont care about his age or his fee, but its  a concern for me. If he stays fit and plays 90% of the league games and all the important champions league games then it will be a truely awesome signing. No questions about his ability obviously. He is a world class midfielder - simple.

145~~~

146~~~
Servus Basti. Top class signing, absolutely delighted. Can't wait for a Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Herrera midfield combo.

147~~~
But Apparently they're not.

Edit: Also it looks like he's suffered the same injury twice in consecutive seasons, missing 36 games in total because of it. Is that just bad luck or is it likely to cause more problems?

148~~~
THIS IS TRULY A MAGICAL TIME OF YEAR.

149~~~
The featured poll for Schweinsteiger has one positive option and 4 horrible ones. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

150~~~
I am happy we are signing someone to replace Carrick but would much rather that player have been Schneiderlin.

Obviously we could still sign him as well but until we do my reaction to this signing is that it's okay, rather than great/terrible.

151~~~
Somehow it does not feel right to never see Lahm, Schweinsteiger and Müller together on the pitch again. Not even for the German team as Lahm has retired...

152~~~
I think you'll be delighted then, he missed 11 league games in 2013/14

153~~~
Yes! Great news!!

154~~~
Last season he was coming off the back of a long World Cup in South America, he's just been on holiday and we'll have him for all our pre-season and manage the number of games he plays well.

155~~~
Pigs have flown.

He'll bring leadership, all round CM quality and a winning mentality. Fantastic signing as long as Schneiderlin is also brought in because of the injuries.

Willkommen to our first German.

156~~~
YES

157~~~
This transfer being completed so quickly could also mean that we changed our decision to go for Schneiderlin once Schweini finally made his decision

158~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

159~~~
Sensible solution is that we just sign Muller. Could go for Lahm too but would need a refund on Darmian.

160~~~
So happy I'm now going to get drunk to celebrate. Schweinsteiger in a United shirt, wow!

161~~~
I find it amusing that the last thing we need were midfielder, yet we have signed one and might get another in Schinerderlin. With De Gea leaving and Falcao, Van Persie and perhaps Hernandez as well, it seems our priority should be a striker and a goalkeeper. Nevertheless, the window is not close yet and we could still get players in that position.

Anyway, good signing(based of his past experience and performances), but I hope this not cause the same "shoehorning" problem we had with our strikers last signing towards our midfield. E.g., Herrera might have to move out wide or we loose focus on Peirrera or any of our acedemy player progress(ala Wilson), just to incorporate our big name players.

162~~~
Please take your negativity elsewhere, while the rest of us rejoice in this moment of pure ecstasy, having signed one of best midfielders of this generation.

163~~~
Yeeeeesssssss!!!!!

164~~~
It's a really important signing for the club at 360°, not only on the pitch.

165~~~
I've wanted us to sign him for the past ten years. Delighted to see him finally arrive.

166~~~
This! Our midfield will be able to go toe to toe with anyone in Europe this season.

167~~~
He was English/Canadian.

168~~~
Already landed.

169~~~
I think a midfielder was one of our highest priorities considering how utterly fecked we were whenever Carrick was out injured last season

170~~~
Good signing.

171~~~
He was and I'm sorry <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

172~~~
The fact that this move was pushed by him makes me think he's going to give it his absolute all for us.

173~~~
Are you sure you were not in his third level of subconscious, Mr. Cobb? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

174~~~
I know, we let ourselves down and got caught off guard <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

175~~~
I think I've caught Schwein flu

176~~~
Sorry, we should all ignore any potential injury/fitness related issues because he's a big name muppet signing. I mean, it worked out so well when we all did that with Falcao, what could possibly go wrong?...

177~~~
Buzzing with this, he's a top player who will add quality along with a ton of experience to our midfield.

178~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yes I know

179~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

180~~~
Then we should have gotten Scheiderlin who is a more natural holding midfield replacement. Moreover, Carrick has not yet hung his boot and his performances last season showed he is still capable of being a starter for United. At the moment, we seem to have an overflow in midfield without any proper balance.

181~~~

184~~~
We already have a better player wearing number 7...

EDIT: Grrr

185~~~
Holy shit I never thought we'd actually sign the Shwein.

186~~~
Medical are designed to check if we're buying damaged goods. If he gets injured it's entirely our fault. The way we train, quality of staff and misfortune with opposition tackles etc.

187~~~
Hopefully have a similar effect van Persie had in his first season here. 

Fair fecking play this is a massive signing.

188~~~
Get in well happy with this, yes he is 31 yes he is a short term solution but he is just what we need right now.
Get the guy from Southampton(god know how you spell it ) and our midfield is looking pretty solid.

189~~~
They haven't helped much in the past! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

190~~~
I remember you putting a downer on that thread as well. Fair enough it turned out you were right, but I can't see that being the case this time.

191~~~
Or some Peroni with Bratwurst <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

192~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Being negative does not make you the voice of reason. It just makes you a boring buzzkill for no apparent reason.

193~~~
Have you ever stopped to enjoy anything in your life?

194~~~
way to put a downer on things BUT you do have a very good point, one I hope is proved wrong.

195~~~
Ana Ivanovic is going to be seen in Manchester and at Old Trafford from time to time. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

196~~~

197~~~
When it's confirmed, I'll make sure to order a slice. Will need some with the stein though.

198~~~
Well then we can't trust any player. By the same token, everybody can be a potential crock. We have to look at ourselves instead of always blaming the player.

199~~~
The German captain and the English captain in the same team.

200~~~
We will see when the season beginnings progresses and ends

201~~~
Fergie was the best in managing older players, picking the games they should play in and the games they should rest. If LvG is as good we have at least 5 years of a top player in Bastian.

202~~~
Guess we'll sign Schneiderlin as well and LVG will (at least) have two players for every (midfield) position.

6: Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Blind
8: Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Herrera, Pereira
10: Herrera, Mata, Fellaini

That would be a brilliant selection headache to have IMO. No Rooney in midfield, we need him upfront anyway.

203~~~
Don't know about this one.. Sure we need a bigger squad this season ´cause of the UCL and the domestic cups but there's no way he should start in any of the big games before Carrick. Sure, he's won a lot but the Bundesliga has become a wash for Bayern who buys the opposition dry year after year. If the wages that are being thrown around are accurate, this might be a Falcao part 2..

But what I like about this and the upcoming Schneiderlin deal is that it pushes Blind to LB permanently and makes him better in that one position.. Blind is no Johnny O'Shea I tell you that..

204~~~
This is how happy we all should be right now.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-RpCa5wxTs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

205~~~
GTFO!

206~~~
All we need to do is pump him full ofGH and TRT and he will be good into his 40's.

207~~~
Just returned from a short holiday and will be leaving again tonight. I only had limited access to teh interwebs and the only news I got made it obvious Van Persie is leaving. Which is fair enough all things considered, though I personally liked him a lot and wasn't happy at all with a player of his calibre and talent leaving us.

But then we signed Bastian Schweinsteiger. Feck yeah. 

I might just get mildly drunk on German beer now since I've got six of them in the fridge and there's nothing better to do anyway. A moment like this needs proper celebrating. It's very interesting that Bayern actually let him go, I wouldn't have guessed that last year. Though since he wanted to try something new, I guess there's not much the Bayern board could have done.

208~~~
French cheese on top?

209~~~
Quick, sign Lloris and Casill- never mind.

210~~~
Ffs, I love carrick but he has never been anywhere close to the level schweinsteiger is. Not even close.

211~~~
A buzzkill because I have legitimate concerns about a players recent injury record? Combined with our record of dealing with injury prone players? And the fact that the PL is an incredibly physically draining league? Its quite clearly not for 'no apparent reason' its actually with very good reason. Because as a player, I think Bastian is fantastic (obviously). I'm not doubting his quality.

Or should I just jump on the 'OMG WE SIGNED SCHEWINSTIGER! WHO CARES ABOUT HIS INJURY RECORD!' band wagon, because well, thats what everyone else is doing?

212~~~
20m euro has been reported.

213~~~
No matter how high the sum was - it needed just a short talk of the officials to get an agreement over it... - nothing that hurts any of the parties!

214~~~
I enjoy plenty of things. Infact, the only signing of the LVG era I've not been on board with yet was that of Falcao

Me too. 

I'm not blaming the player. Hardly their fault if they're injury prone.

215~~~
You're right, childish knee-jerk reactions would be completely out of character.

216~~~
How can he miss 18 games over Bayern's winter break?

217~~~
What is Bratwurst? but Peroni, yeah <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

why boring? I dont know, seems like a normal footballer's account

226~~~
I just followed him on twitter. It's all official now folks.

227~~~
Can't wait for us to have Rooney, Mata, Schweinsteiger and Depay as options for Free kicks only to have Di Maria taking all of them.

228~~~
I can't figure out which is better news, that we just signed him or that Madrid is rumored to have ended their pursuit for De Gea?!

229~~~
You forgot Jones.

230~~~

234~~~
Have you forgotten about our beloved captain's stint in the midfield? His performances had you convinced aye?

235~~~
How is blue moon reacting to all of this?

236~~~
Well he looks back on the World cup from last year. He posts selfies and also congratulates people etc...just look down his timeline.

237~~~
Headache? More like a disaster waiting to happen. Too many midfield players and the best teams in the world usually do not have such an overflow as it can disrupt team chemistry. Blind and Fellaini(two of our best or important players last season) will most likely become bit part players. Mata and one of Carrick or Schneiderlin aswell. The latter dependent on who is more in form and fit. The former, if he does not play on the right. Pereira development will go backward next season unless he is loaned out, so no need mentioning him anymore.

238~~~
feck me, he may be in decline or whatever, but we've made one hell of a signing here. The guy is easily one of the top 3-5 midfielders around at the moment. If we can get a 2-3 good seasons out of him then this might go down as one of our very best signings ever.

I keep thinking that it's the type of signing Fergie would have made -- a bit like when we signed Larsson, only more impressive.

239~~~
Blind and Fellaini aren't good enough to play in our midfield long term, so that would be pretty ideal.

240~~~
Not unexpected. He's the best midfielder in our squad now. Comfortably so

241~~~
Yeah but last year we finished fourth and got knocked out of the cups. We're aiming to go a lot better next season, I don't think anyone sees Blind and Fellaini improving to the extent that they can play a pivotal role in making that happen.

242~~~
All the top European teams have an abundance of quality midfield players - look at the talent in Munich's midfield for starters.

Also:
Carrick - Getting on and will be expected to play more reservedly at his age
Fellaini - Let's be honest, never going to be a regular starter under LVG, nor do I think he'll care if he's playing a more marginal role, I get the impression he loves being here regardless.
Pereira - He's still a youngster
Blind - I'm sure he was signed for his versatility, not to be a regular starter in the midfield. Its a long season so he'll get plenty of minutes in defence and midfield.

That leaves, Mata, Schneiderlin, Herrera and Swine's tiger as our firm first choice midfielders. They'll all play plenty of games, likely starting most of them too.

243~~~

244~~~
Pretty good signing by United.

245~~~
This pleases me.

246~~~
Could be a good signing but Schneiderlin is far far more important. Lets sign him up and then review this one as it would then make a lot more sense

247~~~
Only Carrick, Herrera and Blind are central midfielders. Fellini and Mata are second strikers/attacking midfielders/wide attackers (in Mata's case sometimes). There is not enough.

248~~~
Injuries and transfer fee/wages aside, the way I see it is that we can start the new campaign with a squad that includes Bastian Schweinsteiger, or a squad that doesn't!  I certainly know which option I prefer...

249~~~
Griaß di Basti,

kumm hera, samma mehra.

At least this signing will help to bring back the respect to our rivals. It is good to have names like him on the Team sheet.

250~~~
Can the season start yet?

251~~~
Do you know something we don't? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

252~~~
You get a point for putting Depay and Di Maria the right way round, you lose several for putting fecking McNair instead of Rojo. And anotherone for spelling it 'Schweni'. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

253~~~
What a signing.

254~~~
The only problem with these stats is that the ones for Bastian are in another league so cannot really be compared directly.
However I would be delighted to get the 'Pig Man' finally.

255~~~
Oops. Completely forgot we have Rojo.

256~~~

257~~~
If he doesn't sign then it makes this so-called selection "headache" less of a problem.

258~~~
Nipped out to Homebase, come back to find the thread name change and tweets from United. I should go to homebase more often!

259~~~
Its going to be like having Keane back in the middle, as in, having someone who plays like they give a feck.

260~~~
Are you serious mate? Last season we only had around 40-45 games and we badly struggled in midfield. We had to play Rooney there (and consequently suffered upfront), even Valencia played there once or twice. I know we had injury issues beyond every imagination, but this season we'll have the league, Cups (we can't do worse than last year surely), Europe to contend with, so 50 games minimum. Furthermore, LVG definitely moves to a 4-3-3 system and we need three real midfielders in there. I think one more signing in CM is definitely required to have us compete on all fronts.

261~~~
I hope you at least remembered to use your nectar card.

262~~~
Audacious, in a good way.

263~~~
Yes

Zieler and Niemeyer never played
Heinze had a german passport

264~~~
He's a central midfielder in the most creative and offensively potent side in the Bundesliga and one of the best worldwide. It's sort of a given that he'd have better stats in those areas.

265~~~
Get the feck in!

266~~~
I have absolutely no problem with his age. If he surround him with energetic players like Herrera, Di Maria, Depay and Rooney he will flourish. I just hope he will stay fit.

Massive signing.

267~~~
Only just saw this. Wow. Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

For years this guy was my theoretical dream replacement for Roy Keane. Holy shit.

273~~~
Same... I just hope it isn't a couple years too late!

274~~~
That depends on how long it will take these new players to settle into the team, style of play and English football. Blind and Fellaini will still play a major role.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

hope he brings his world cup medal to carrington. 'Have you got one of these? Have you? How about you?'

279~~~
Most important thing I see is that Schweinsteiger is great when he plays but he has played even fewer minutes than Carrick last season which is worrying. 

Also looking at those stats it is weird Carrick is considered our best midfielder, he is worse than the other 3 compared on those stats.

280~~~
Exactly how I feel, I see the positives of Schweinsteiger in conjunction with Schneiderlin, once that is confirmed and we know it wasn't one or the other I'll enjoy this more, we'll have the best midfield in the PL.

281~~~
This feels like a match day.

282~~~
As of right now, the dutch captain too.

283~~~
What I like about signings like this is that they can have a knock-on effect in a tough market these days. You buy one very highly regarded player and then other top players whose minds are 50/50 about where to go can suddenly be swayed. There is no downside at all to this signing, only if we didn't sign Schneiderlin, but by all accounts we're still going ahead with that too.

284~~~
He missed from the start of the season until November with an injury, a total of 18 games.

285~~~
Please take note: This is the United forum.

No more GIFS, kermits etc...

287~~~
Went food shopping came back signed Schweini!!! Wilkommen! Well happy! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

288~~~
What a signing this is, I always try and picture players in their new club shirts, some feel right some don't, Torres for example looked all wrong in chelski blue.

 The pig farmer seems to fit the royal robes a treat, one of the best signings in a long time, made up.

289~~~
Stats are often misleading. They're all different players with differing roles.

290~~~
How long before Phil Jones injures him in training?

291~~~
Mata will just smile and bring his out. Which will include 2 European championship medals, that Bastian doesn't own.

292~~~
Super signing. As I said <a class="username" data-user="23979, @Lawman" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23979/">@Lawman</a>, this is LVG's 'Jim Leigton Moment' ;-).

Other thread closed, thought someone might get a lol out of that.

293~~~
That was only because we were shoehorning falcao and Van persie upfront. When van goal realized that mata and Herrera added more balance, our performance become better.

294~~~
Oooooh! Someone's a bit jealous.

295~~~
i think Mata can just counter with his, and the Euro one as well.

296~~~
Fantastic signing this. Just think, a couple of years ago we had probably the worst midfield out of all the top clubs. Now look at it...

297~~~
Jesus christ! RAWK on!

298~~~
He only has one Euro medal. He wasn't in the 2008 winning squad. He was still in the U21 squad at that time.

302~~~
Bit like losing Luis Suarez and buying Rickie Lambert.

303~~~
Yep, not only with transfers, but buying a world class player with Schweinsteigers history can only have a positive impact throughout the squad. He's somebody who will always give 100% and definitely raise everyone's game, will demand the highest standards from everyone, and is a true leader in there, something we have lacked. Ignoring his obvious individual quality on the pitch, I can't see how all our other players don't improve playing alongside him and seeing him out there next to them. Even if only for a couple of seasons, it will be huge for us.

304~~~
The three players we've signed so far in Memphis, Schweini and Darmian will be more effective than all the average shite they've signed.

305~~~
Just further evidence that stats do not tell the full story. When Carrick played we won. When he didn't we didn't.

306~~~

307~~~
You've got to wonder what losing Kroos and Schweinsteiger in consecutive seasons is doing to Bayern's image. Also first time in 5 years the Germany captain won't be playing at Bayern.

308~~~
Here's hoping that with Bastian here he will help us get Leno to replace De Gea.

309~~~
I can't believe its happening.

310~~~
OT is going to love him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

And what a player for Herrera and Schneiderlin to learn from.

311~~~
Very happy for Schweinsteiger. He has always said he wants the abroad experience. Also the way Pep brought in the even older Alonso and instantly gave him Schweinsteiger's role at Bayern is a ridiculous treatment to a man who should be treated like a legend for club and country.

312~~~
Our first German!

313~~~
1. We didn't lost De Gea jet and i am more confident that he will stay day after day.
2. I know it is a joke but how can he, as a pundit, joke about WC winner and such a great player like Bastian. Surely someone who is as well known as he is in the media can't just post like that.

314~~~
I agree but I do not see why they would be content with warming the bench after showing they are more than capable starters for United last season. As I stated, if they are ok with being subsidiary players then it will work out great. However, I m not sure what type of a player would want to be bit part players.

All the top teams does not have an abundance of midfielder. Barcelona has only Iniesta, Busquit, and Rakitic, while the rest are academy. Real Madrid has khedira, Modric, kroos and few others who are barely recognizable. Chelsea has Matic, Ramieres, Fabregas and Mikel. Not that much quality. Munich has Thiago, Javier Martinez, Xavi Alonso, and few others, but that does not come close our midfield number. Only Arsenal I can say has as much an overflow in quality midfielder then us. 

If we play a midfield three, Fellaini and mata will count as central midfielder. More so Fellaini then Mata, who might occupy a wide right role.

We had to play Rooney there to shoehorn our strikers, not for the reason you mentioned.

315~~~
I was looking at some of the earlier posts in the other Schwein thread and apparently last season he missed the start due to being put on rest by the club doctor after the World Cup. he was fine until march where he got kicked in his ankle and was then rested for 2 matches and the rest of the missed time was for flu

It doesn't sound that bad tbh

316~~~
Heh. I can taste the bitterness.

317~~~
Unbelievable signing. Well done, Woody <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

318~~~
Schweini was injured during the start of the season.

I don't get the blame Bayern gets, to be honest. Schweinsteiger wanted to leave and I don't see anything wrong with Bayern granting him that wish. Rummenigge and Sammer both said that they wanted to keep him, but I guess some people only see what they want to see.

319~~~
He can do much better than this semi-try (ist that even a word) of a banter. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Couldn't be happier with Schweinsteiger, finally we have great player in the middle of the park again (although fair play to Carrick, he's been outstanding player). Our strikers will love him and he knows LVG tactics inside out, have a feeling him and Herrera could develop really good partnership.

Now for defence to strenghten (CB), De Gea situation to resolve, and new striker brough in the mix to provide some competition for Rooney and this United team will have all qualities to be great again.

320~~~
Lol we'll wait and see buddy

321~~~
If I was Schneiderlin and I saw that Schweinsteiger was joining us, I would want to join United even more.

322~~~
Schweinsteiger has no impact on the third most attacking of the central three. He only affects the other two and I can't see mata or fellaini being even considered in those positions barring injuries. Herrera, Blind, Carrick and Schweinsteiger. You need at least 4 for 2 positions IMO given Carrick is 34. And you never know, if the manager moves someone else on, or decides blind is a left back, then schneiderlin has a place too.

323~~~
I know! He imploded <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> pure bitterness and denial.

324~~~
He's the most German man in the history of Germans.

325~~~
We should get Robben while we're at it. Well actually we probably shouldn't considering his age, inuries and Di Maria. But then again we really should at least make a bid, and try really hard for Mùller too. We should attempt do to Bayern what they did to Dortmund.

326~~~
I really think people are underestimating exactly how massive a signing this is for us.

Skills aside, this is a guy who can bring leadership, belief, direction and mentorship to our team. He can bring a sense of calm to a shakey back four, and slowly instill a sense of confidence within them.

He will bring balance to the force.

327~~~
"Schweinsteiger has/had problems with his ankle. That is the story since 2 or 3 years. He had surgery in the summer break in 2013 after the Treble Season and because of that came late into the season 2013/14. But he still had problems during the whole season and they got him through the World Cup with pain killers.

After the World Cup Müller-Wohlfahrt ordered a bigger rest for him because of that - so it could really heal. That is why he did not start into the training again until mid or end of October.

Everything fine until somewhen in March when he got kicked badly in the Dortmund match - and had to be rested for a match or 2. But in addition to that he had a real bad flu that took two weeks."

Post by <a class="username" data-user="62494, @Blackwidow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/62494/">@Blackwidow</a>

Honestly it doesn't sound like he's too prone to getting injured so I think people should worry less

328~~~
Age doesn't necessarily reduce class. You are proof of that, henrik <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

329~~~
That would be Oliver Kahn.

That my friend is Stefan Effenberg.

332~~~
Bastian is an intelligent player with tons of experience and skill. If players like Herrera who hasn't played in CL much less win it and has not been capped for his nt can effortlessly blend into the English game, you know that all it requires is skill and commitment.

333~~~
To celebrate this signing I am going to find a pig and mount it. I am that happy. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

338~~~
Over the hill, injury prone, on too much money and will take up a place in the side that a younger, better player could have.

A signing based on him being a big name and a once great player. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">This is the Falcao thread isn't it?</span>

Just saw wiki and his full name says Bastian Schweinsteiger, always though Bastian is short for Sebastian <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

342~~~
The poll about how we feel about him coming doesn't really cover how I feel. I wouldn't say it's 'brilliant' but it's slightly better than 'decent'. I'd describe it as a solid signing that'll bring experience and stability into the area on the field we need it the most (or arguably second most after the defense).

Also, it's Basti<b>a</b>n <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

im so happy. Honestly get a cb in, Schneiderlin and a striker and we are in such a fecking good place. Benzema and otamendi/ramos and we get that league title.

This is not the Falcao thread.

Edit: damn I only drank two Warsteiner and already fell for it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

346~~~
Will the younger player have the same experience as him? He is leaving Bayern to rise up to another challenge in his career. If he thought he just wants to ride in to the sunset, he would rather have preferred to go to the States. He is going to be good singing for United. Especially if United manage to qualify for the group stages of the champions league.

His training methods, his skill will all be put to good use and younger players at United will get to learn from him. It's a great deal for United.

Edit: Damn it!!!

347~~~
I hope your team is ready for next season...Schweinsteiger against Bentaleb and Mason

And the greatest winners interview ever.

Mueller: I don´t give a shit about the golden boot, I´m a world champion.

Schweini: He said you look very nice.

349~~~
Wonder what number he'll be getting... 31 is taken by Fellaini, Evans has 6 (might be sold though so it would make sense to give that to Schweiny or Schneiderlin), Mata has 8. Not sure what other "midfielder" numbers there are and Van Gaal actually cares about that.

350~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px">+++Breaking News+++</span>

We sign Ivanovic as well (Ana) <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

351~~~
medical tomorrow, according to Sky.

352~~~
Reminds me of the Pirlo to Juve transfer. Although Pirlo was 32 at the time. Didn't turn out too bad for them mind.

353~~~
Where is he now? Is he on the plane to Manchester for a medical? Anyone knows?

354~~~
WC player no doubt and a good signing as long as he's rotating with Carrick. If both start then its not a good signing as Herrera will most likely be dropped and it would make a even worse signing because Pereira will hardly get any minutes at all.
I can see Carrick being moved on next season (don't want it to happen as I think he's the deep lying midfield in the PL and a WC player) and Bastian taking his position in the team. Rooney and Bastian as the 2 senior players in the squad doesn't sound to bad as long as we keep bringing in/develop players that will be here for the long term Like Herrera, Darmian, Blind, Rojo, Shaw, Depay, Januzaj, Pereira, Wilson.

355~~~
lets go into muppet mode, next Gundogan and Hummels.

356~~~
I think that is what some are forgetting, that he will have other people doing the running for him.

357~~~
Bastian. Fecking. Schweinsteiger.

Enough said.

358~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2013/08/14/jennifer-lawrence-10.gif" src="http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2013/08/14/jennifer-lawrence-10.gif"/>

359~~~
Think he is going to be important part in our transition period.

360~~~
What, the two players that are definitely staying put?

361~~~
Fan song? Something to the tune of 'let it shine'? 'He's our schwein, He's our schwein'

362~~~
I never go all muppet about signings, but this takes the biscuit. Most exciting since van Persie and I think you have to go all the way back to Cristiano for the next one that really had me smiling like a little kid.

Shame he broke up with that model girlfriend though <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

363~~~
Fellaini can destroy that Spurs midfield never mind Bastian.

364~~~
If we sign Schneiderlin in addition to this, we would have gone in the space of 2 years to from having a dogshit midfield and being overloaded with top strikers, to having an extremely strong midfield but a very limited forward line. Benteke would be perfect as a 2nd option to Rooney in my opinion, with Wilson being 3rd choice.

365~~~
You really need to get over to a Barcelona match this pre-season and have a word with Messi <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

I reckon that's purely a product of Carrick playing so much deeper than the other midfielders. Fellaini for example was effectively a forward for much of last season whereas Carrick was positioned just in front of our centre backs.

366~~~
Where did I or anyone else blame Bayern. I think Bayern is treating Schweinsteiger with the respect he deserves and sees him as the legend he is. But Pep's treatment of Schweinsteiger hasn't been the way it should be in my opinion. So if anything I was blaming solely Pep in that post.

367~~~
The best thing for me about us signing him is that he is a winner, just having him in the club in some capacity is a fecking bonus.

368~~~
This hasn't been confirmed yet? Premature closure of transfer thread?

369~~~

What a great transfer, big Ed is spoiling us.

I'm so fecking happy right now! If we sign Schneiderlin too then we will have an unreal midfield.

373~~~
Subject to medical. Agreement with bm not confirmed signing yet

374~~~
This

375~~~
Hence why i said muppet mode.

376~~~
He's with Ana Ivanovic now. She's a nice replacement.

377~~~
A lot happened since 2013 though.

378~~~
This

379~~~
he speaks English? Nice......

380~~~
That is awkward. Stop being awkward, pep.

381~~~
At this point I literally couldn't care less about where he'll fit in. I'm just so happy we've signed him.

382~~~
Don't forget passion and aggression. He's the type of Dymanic midfielder we have missed since Keano left.

383~~~
Pig Farmer Bomaye! Pig Farmer Bomaye!

384~~~
Wow, just saw this and I am really excited, can't remember when is the last time some of our signing made me more happy. Great stuff.  

fecking Bastian, who would have thought?

385~~~
Nah, no comprison. Best WAG ever, you can't find any imprefection, and then you see how she carries the beers like they are trophies, and that she hasn't waited to have a few sips along the way... 

Not sure how you can break up with that.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/FEdKw7F.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/FEdKw7F.jpg"/>

386~~~
Yeah I want Schneiderlin as well. He's there for the club to buy, as no one else appears to be interested.
I also want to keep Van Persie, and buy a powerhouse center half. Then I can say we've had a superb transfer window.

387~~~
Good, now I can cheer for him without feeling too bad <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

Probably my favourite Bayern player of this generation. He had to endure a lot of shit in his career (not only injuries but also the media treatment he got at a time was pathetic), but rose above it and led his team/nation to a lot of success. At this point, still the most complete midfielder in my eyes.

Massive signing for United. Exactly what they need now.

388~~~
Aye, same here. I think it was RvP, but that was more out of complete shock, while this is the one player that would have been top of my transfer targets for the last five years or so. Can't wait to see him playing for us.

389~~~
That's a lovely looking beer <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

390~~~
Same again when you look at the defensive stats...

391~~~
I know! That's why I love that pic, it's really hard to keep focused: "Babe, gooood, beer, gooood.... erm what babe again?" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

392~~~
Nope, never seen it before. Thanks for sharing.

393~~~
I reckon Schweini won't be signing the Gaucho song much with Adm, Rojo, and Otamendi around. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

394~~~
Great signing, though hard to believe it's real. He'll have to be managed correctly but should be key in a lot of games. Exactly what we need right now.

395~~~
We've signed a winner who is also a leader. Can't ask for much more than that.

396~~~
Does this mean we will see another Ana Ivanovic at OT ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

397~~~
I think Schweini and Carrick will take turns partnering Schneiderlin. Seeing as both are in their 30s, LvG will want to go sparingly on both of them over a potential 60 fixture season.

398~~~
I can't find a tweet but just want to know who first said that United representatives are in Munich working on a Bastian deal. It was i think yesterday in the morning hours well before Bild broke the story and the tweet was posted in transfer tweets thread.

399~~~
Going to be tough to think of a chant for this one.

400~~~
He's obviously a brilliant player with great technical ability and what not but I think the best part for me is his intelligence.

If Van Gaal wants a team that plays tactical and intelligent football then Schweinsteiger and Carrick is a brilliant base to work from.

401~~~
Had no idea he scored against us...great finish.

402~~~
I hope Bastian Schweinsteiger doesn't ask to have his whole name printed on the back of the shirt. Imagine his name there... it could go a full circle. I'll be ripped before you know it...

Second, would Van Gaal consider giving him the vice captain role straight off, given his knowledge of the player and the amount of experience Mr. BS has over the years?

403~~~
Nah, I think Van Gaal is pretty happy with Carrick as his second in command... he loves Carrick (who doesn't?)

404~~~
Surely something to the tune of "Spider Pig" from the Simpsons Movie no?

405~~~
That thread title gives me wood.

406~~~
Think some are saving that for Schneiderlin

407~~~
LvG loves and trusts Carrick, isn't it obvious enough?

408~~~
Ah yes. Between the two of them there are only so many possibilities. It's a good job we never got Sneijder in the end!

409~~~
Still cant believe this <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

410~~~
The second name of Demichelis son is Bastian... - actually Martin Bastian Demichelis (first name after father, second after Bastian) 

(when we talk about Argentinian's in Manchester... )

411~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

412~~~
Brilliant how we are wrapping up deals so early, both in and out.  Love it!!  LVG and Woody make a decent duo.

413~~~
Were man united. We will find a way to make sure he ends up on the treatment table for long periods of next season :P

414~~~
Mr Bayern Munich leaving Bayern - I must admit that I didnt see this coming.
Though, he is still subject to a medical - this guy has ongoing injury problems for the last 2 years (similar to Carrick), so I wont believe it until I see him actually play.

Maybe the CM slot will be shared between Carrick and Schweinsteiger?
And the other CM slot will be taken by Schneiderlin?

415~~~
I remember agreeing a fee with Bayern for him in FIFA 11 and being hype as hell until, when I offered him contractual terms, he said he wasn't interested in relocating. Balls to that summer.

416~~~
I love the sour grapes coming from the likes of Carragher. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

427~~~
We finally have a German to take our penalties. And what a line up to take our other set pieces as well - Mata, Schweinsteiger, Depay, Di Maria and Rooney. No more Jones to take corners.

428~~~
So is he already in Manchester or is he not?

429~~~
I read that he's in Manchester for a medical. Will probably be a presentation tomorrow or monday for both him and Darmian.

430~~~
I really like the player so it's great to have him in our team but unfortunately I think his best lies behind him. Hope he can still have a quality time in our team for the next couple of years.

431~~~
They are leaving on Monday for the tour. Doubt they will have the presentation then.

432~~~
The eye of the schweinsteiger!

Goes well with the United walk on intro.

433~~~
Van Gaal:

What I rather see:
*or mata one will be out right
Schweinsteiger will have an affect because he will most likely start and push Herrera to the furthurest number 10 spot, which will affect Di Maria or Mata role in our starting eleven as that number ten spot can only be occupied by one player.

434~~~
You're right, I need to add 'Can't play the drums' to my list.

435~~~
to celebrate i will stock up german beers when i do the next purchase

436~~~
Ah, thought they left on tuesday. Tomorrow it is then!

437~~~
No - you do not have a German to take penalties.

He missed in the CL final 2012 - and actually I cannot remember that one after that went in. The last try was in the last match for the German team against Gibraltar. Müller was not available and he was the captain in that match, that is probably why he took it...
I remember that he always made jokes about Müller when he started to exercise for them in 2012 after everybody else was missing. There were about 5 penalties in a row from different players Bayern missed after that final. He told then that Müller's penalties would look absolutely funny. Müller answered the media that Bastian might think that because his penalties always go in... - I will miss that banter

Do not let him take the penalties... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

His set-pieces are ok.

Corners - no. He is an additional man in the box to score headers.

438~~~
I appreciate the concern that you have towards the signing from an "he's older and potentially past his peak and a bit battered" but the "we've too many midfielders" argument leaves me completely bemused!

You've gone on to mention two players who proved, if anything, that they clearly aren't good enough midfielders for what we need. Yes, Blind started off well in the middle but it was soon evident that he isn't quick or sharp enough to run that area of the pitch. A quality LB, agreed, but he's not a central midfielder of the standard we need to be targeting. Fellaini was pretty much useless in that role and only became valuable as a forward and, in truth, he only really had a few decent games in that role towards the end of the season.

I also like to see youth developed but the best way for that to happen is for them to learn from the best. If they're good enough then they'll show themselves to be worthy of a position in the squad in due course. To not sign a player who can instantly improve the squad because there's a couple young players who might eventually make it is backwards logic. Fine if the squad is already achieving its objectives but not when it's clearly lacking.

439~~~
I'm speechless. Roy Keane is back. He could get this team rolling on a new level. Only worried they are selling us Hargreaves again.

440~~~
I for one can't wait to start swearing in German everytime we concede a goal. Sounds so much more powerfull and relieving.

441~~~
Wanted us to sign him for a while now and finally glad we have. I think he'll adapt quickly to the English game, hopefully Schneiderlin joins him.

442~~~
Yeah or we could even decide to keep Rooney at CF, Mata out wide, then we have 3 positions available:

Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Blind, Herrera, Fellaini & Pereira.

For 2 wide forward positions:
AdM, Depay, Mata, Young.

Seems well balanced. & if you consider age/injuries/rotation, we can still add Schneiderlin. A bit overkill if we're not selling anyone, but at least littered with quality options.

443~~~
So we finally have a German, a top class one, playing for us in England, and we still can't let him take penalties. I don't like this.

444~~~
Welcome Basti. Honour to have you in Manchester United. I hope local 'ze bier from glas' will be as good as the Bavarian one.

Get in !

445~~~
He's not in Manchester yet is he?!! I don't like this, surefire jinx <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

446~~~
Seems like a good signing.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's always seemed like the type of character you'd want in the dressing room. Had no idea he had that side to him too.

466~~~
Terrific player & leader as everyone knows, just a matter of how much he still has in the tank and how he adjusts to the pace of the game in the Premiership

Long has been the German whose name I cannot say without an exaggerated German accent

467~~~
Ill never forget his expression after he bottled the peno vs us in the final! Come get some revenge Sweini! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

468~~~
The Germans on here can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Schweinsteiger is definitely a "lad," so to speak. In fact, I think that was a perceived problem of his when he was younger; that he partied too much or was involved in the tabloids with other young German stars like Podolski.

469~~~
Ana Ivanovic > Everyone else

470~~~
not Klum (if you are serious)

471~~~
Made a slight edit (added Phil Jones) to yesterday's gif:

Agree she could do with a bit more meat. I have plenty. Match made in heaven.

473~~~
Fixed

474~~~

475~~~
Well yeah I would but she's a bit too skinny for my tastes.

476~~~
Has someone ordered that statue for Woodward

477~~~
can't disagree at all

478~~~
5 hours too late

479~~~
Just bloody incredible. I think its an indulgent signing by the manager just as RvP was with Fergie. 

Might not be the most logical but so may have wanted him un the team for so long.

480~~~
I'd love to know what the bayern fans think about this? Anyone know one?

This is like bayern signing a 27 year old giggs from us. Or who knows. I'm in shock

481~~~
Not signed yet. Should really move this thread back!

482~~~
Actually no, that tweet included quotes from Low and his appearances in the last 5 seasons or so... it beats spamming the thread with raunchy pictures of women.

483~~~
Apparently they boo the announcement at today's presser KR had to reassure them that Muller would not go the same way.

484~~~
Will reopen this when/if it's confirmed

Can't wait for his first interview.

515~~~
United are <i>delighted</i> to announce Schweinsteiger...


While they can only muster a <i>pleased</i> to announce for Darmian...


Poor Matteo!

516~~~
That peculiar feeling when our midfield is suddenly 1250% better.

517~~~
They won't care, they know the terms of contract. Nobody will be buying a Schweinsteiger Nike shirt.

518~~~
No more sideways passing <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Bliss

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger. I cannot wait for this season to start!

Surreal.

Fußballgott has arrived.

I don't feel these are empty words either. We were able to sign him completely unopposed.

Did anyone in their right mind ever imagine seeing the image of Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger playing at OT in a United shirt? Surely this is a dream?

558~~~
Wow, it's actually happened.  After all the players and agents who regularly namedrop us to earn themselves a new contract, it's easy to become very sceptical when big name players are linked to us.

We have actually signed Bastian Schweinsteiger!

559~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

560~~~
I'm drinking Spumante of Asti, now we have signed fecking Basti !!!

561~~~
We really should continue that Bavarian tradition to call him <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fußballgott </span>in Old Trafford also.

562~~~
I wasn't serious!

563~~~
fecking bastard!

564~~~
Delighted to have him at the club! True legend.  Maybe he can help us get Muller next summer.  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

565~~~
Our Asst coach being slightly biased here.

566~~~
I wonder if signing such a big name would make it easier to persuade a player like Ramos to push a move harder now? These 4 signings have shown true intent from Woody and LvG; they want to push forward on getting United back to the top as quickly as possible, and every player signed so far have been in positions we desperately needed to improve on.

567~~~
Hmmm

568~~~
Do you know Stan Chow?

569~~~
I'm not sure whether to blow my proverbial muppet load in this thread or the Schneiderlin one.

575~~~
No love for Morgon and Darmian, only Basti.

576~~~
I love all our players except for Rooney.

577~~~
He was coach at Bayern with, LVG, no? So would make sense since he's the only player he actually knows personally.

578~~~

Welcome to Manchester United Basti.

582~~~
I honestly still can't believe it. It has to be a dream.

583~~~
We've finally have someone who can be Keano-esque in the midfield. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

584~~~
You've got to hand it to Woody. What a signing. What a day.

585~~~

586~~~
The way this one came to be is just the stuff of dreams.

587~~~
Since LVG's arrival we're really doing well keeping things secret and getting them done fast.

588~~~
It's amazing, hiding Schneiderlin behind the Schweinsteiger saga is pure genius <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Can't wait for the games (and FIFA 16 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>)

623~~~

Just read somewhere that it's "The equivalent of Scholes leaving United when he's 30/31 and going to Bayern" 

That was 05/06 so A) Think about how good Scholes was after that, and b) Imagine how fecked we'd have been if that happened!

635~~~
Can you imagine how stoked they're going to be to have Schweinsteiger on the same team as them? Must be such a boost.

636~~~
That midfield though.

637~~~
Definitely. To look beside you in a game and see a World Cup winner? Not going to fear anyone this season.

638~~~
Mutv now. Come on.

641~~~
Please someone share an MUTV live stream!

642~~~
Sadly, I doubt they'll let Juan sit on Anders lap the whole way.

650~~~
So Ander and Basti sitting together, while Mata will be sitting next to DDG. Rojo and Blind are already a couple anyway, this leaves Di Maria who should have nothing to worry as he can sit with someone he knows well in Otamendi/Ramos.

Oh and it took us forever to sign a first team German, but boy did we do it in style.
It had to be a midfielder, a recent world cup winner and captain of the reigning world champions!

651~~~
Poor Felli.  He already looks like he knows he's 2nd choice now.

652~~~
Hah, weird but I am fine with that. He is honest.

At 2:50, did he just say that Rooney called him a kraut? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

659~~~
He's even nailed the interview, is there anything he can't do?

660~~~
I feel like a little girl at a one direction concert. I'm literally pissing myself in excitement.

661~~~
Nah, i think he said that the Englishmen call the germans in general krauts, so he joked about that with Wayne and being the first German player etc..Dont think our captain would call him that.

662~~~
The tennis circus and a girlfriend with who he probably has to talk English (if they talk) has improved his English.

663~~~
This <i>is </i>Wayne Rooney we're talking about.

664~~~
- same philosophy;
- dreamed of playing for Man Utd;
- know Van Gaal but not the main factor for signing;
- want to play for the supporters;
- told rooney that he is the first kraut to play for man utd;

665~~~
Still, it is too early....especially after that dive last year to get sent him off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

666~~~
This has come to my mind as well. They spend all that money and this happens. 

Oh well they'll just get the club to buy more class players next season <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

667~~~
I think he says to Rooney that he's the first kraut, rather than Rooney calling him a kraut. Either way wtf <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

668~~~
Yep and then asked is that what you call us. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

669~~~
What a legend. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

670~~~
Impressed with how good his english is, knew he could speak it but didn't know he was so fluent in it.

671~~~
yeah my bad. just heard it again.

672~~~
Seems like a great guy. Fecking Rooney, calling him a kraut first thing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

673~~~

Herbert Hainer (Adidas boss) was asked Saturday night at a Bavarian Sports Award show about that topic - that Bayern sells now less Schweinsteiger kits (it was more a question in humorous voice). He answered that they might have done a good deal then with making a contract with United some months ago...

For Bayern it just means that the fans will buy the jersey with name of the others.

If you look at the other names in the teams that have Adidas - they have now the front person for the Adidas advertisings with United.

680~~~

681~~~
Still can't believe we've signed him. It's surreal. A genuinely top class midfield general, which we've been lacking for years now. 

The start of the season can't come soon enough (after we get Otamendi though...).

682~~~
He truly has the best name in football.

683~~~
Over/under until he's vice captain?  I give it a year (unless Ramos actually signs...).

684~~~
What a great interview. I didn't realise how well spoken he is, or how good his English is. He's genuinely clearer and easier to understand then the likes of Rooney and Smalling.

685~~~
Definitely Van Gaal's love child. He even says "philosophy" barely 20 secs into the interview.

686~~~
Oi. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Started off second choice last season and we all know how that ended. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Look at him, he's actually happy and proud to be at the club. Feels a bit like when RVP came, more so than with ADM. Hopefully his impact will be similar.

693~~~
But I like that when he was asked how much influence of LvG getting him here and he said yes, but it's not about him (LvG), it's about the club. Very good answer there and it shows he genuinely loves joining us. It's great to hear him say, I am here to win titles, and Manchester United is used to winning titles.

694~~~
Same here. Its an odd feeling.

695~~~
I actually think I love him already.

696~~~
At least he was here when it was 30+ degrees <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> poor Darmian will have come from sun soaked Turin to rain soaked Manchester.

697~~~
Great interview from him.  Really warming to him, seems chuffed to be here.

698~~~
If he still ends up first choice with the choice of midfielders we have available, something has gone seriously wrong.

699~~~
Not really. It'll be because he's deserved it.

700~~~
Having seen his level the last three seasons, if he ends up 'deserving it' then someone needs to get kicked out of OT considering the talent we have in that position now.

701~~~
Fantastic interview, intelligent and articulate with a clam presence, I also liked that he was keen to stress it was the club more so than the manager that was foremost in his decision.

702~~~
Right, this has been fun. Now it's time for us all to wake up.

703~~~
He doesn't look anything like a clam. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

704~~~
Three seasons?

If he ends up deserving it, it's because he's played well like last season. I mean, there was times last season when he kept Herrera out the team. Yes, it's Fellaini and he didn't have a great first season, but name and reputation of players should mean feck all.

Also, nothing has changed in regards to Fellaini's place in the team. Last season he finished off playing as the most advanced midfielder (10). Neither of the two signings (Bastian and Schneiderlin) play as a 10, which means they shouldn't jeopardize Fellaini's position in the team. It'll just most likely mean that Herrera will be pushed into the position Fellaini was in at the end of last season.

705~~~
How can somebody who has spent his whole life living in Germany speak better English than me?

706~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eF5d1OfoaLo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

707~~~
And that is the point. If we go 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, we have at least 3 midfielders better than him in the position for the two at the base. As a #10, Mata and Herrera are both way ahead of him. So as things stand, he would be third choice considering the talent on display.

If he still ends up being first choice, two players must have had a mare in their positions and that is what I meant when I said something must have gone horribly wrong.

I said three seasons as I started paying attention to him in his last season at Everton when he started getting player higher up the field and was a nuisance in general for opposing defenders.

708~~~
Precisely. I try to come to terms with it. Try to believe it's actually come true. Fail <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

709~~~
You say nothing has changed for Fellaini, but then mention Herrera will likely replace him (which I consider to be highly likely)?  So which is it?

I think Herrera is near undroppable at this point...

710~~~
Where are you from?

711~~~
England <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

712~~~
Sun soaked Turin?

713~~~
Good English!

714~~~
Impressed with each of Schweini, Schneiderlin, and Darmian's interviews. They seem like down to earth lads and good professionals.

715~~~
Smalling has seemed pretty clear and articulate whenever I've heard him speak. Better than most.

716~~~
He does speak well, but he's just so slow. Always seems very nervous.

Bastian was as cool as they come. What a man.

717~~~
I said this yesterday but we had the best possession stats in the league last season with a an avergae of 61%, what the hell kind of possession stats will we have this season now we actually have a midfield?

718~~~
Krauts part. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

719~~~
Wow his English is spot on and he comes across as such a nice guy. I've never seen a new signing say so many good things about United and genuinely mean it. Tbf RVP did as well. I really think Schweini is a United fan. I usually slate people who say a top footballer would come to United just because he supports us but in this case it's genuinely true. 
I think he is now my favourite United player. I used to strongly dislike him as he came across as a cnut for some reason. I will probably be happy to see Germany do well from now on if he's still leading them.

720~~~
Nothing has changed in terms of Herrera was here last year, and started over Fellaini in the advanced position (him or Mata) until Fellaini got played ahead of the both.

Anyway, this is not me coming on here to try and say Fellaini should be starting. I mean, he most likely won't, but it's kind of annoying that some people have written him off, despite giving us something different no one else can offer us in midfield. He was a massive danger man for us last season and I recall him Van Gaal saying he was 'undroppable' at the time.

Fellaini won't be played at the base. In a 433, yes, I can imagine Herrera will start over him, but to say he and Mata are 'way ahead of him' is silly because Fellaini offers something completely different to those two. He was a big part of our great run last season.

721~~~
Clam presence <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

722~~~
You know Turin is in the northern most part of Italy, right? Not Sardinia? There are ski resorts about an hour away.

723~~~
Yeah, Turin is like Bahamas and all.

724~~~
At least you can speak better English than Rooney. Right?

725~~~
I hope so. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

726~~~
Yes, sun soaked Turin.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/LvpTHBQ.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/LvpTHBQ.jpg"/>

<a class="username" data-user="41295, @Mockney" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41295/">@Mockney</a> the ski resorts are up in the Italian Alps aren't they? Not down at sea level near Turin. I know it's not exactly Scicily but it'll still be very nice weather. It's Italy.

Yous all don't have to scrutinise everything you know <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> it was a throw away comment used to compare with the shitty Manc weather we're having today.

727~~~
You mean the great run of a grand total of three matches after which our strategy was psyched out and we became toothless. 

Just because Fellaini offers something different does not mean he is the better option there. Andy Carroll would offer something different than Rooney but who would prefer him to our captain?

728~~~
Look at you fishing for jokes. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

729~~~
Be sure he exactly knows what to say... - he is a media professional today (he has done enough mistakes in the past)

Some maybe should not underestimate that he knows United better than a lot think. Him and Hargreaves are really close friends and Hargreaves is meeting with him whenever he is in Munich (what is quite often). Both are homegrown (even if Owen is Canadian but he was in Germany from age 17 on) and were the only ones in the team with a lot of "veterans" when they started at Bayern (Lahm spent the first two years in Stuttgart).

730~~~
I still can't believe that we signed this bloke......Di Maria and Falcao were massive disappointments but I have a really good feeling about Schweini....The man is just a class act...everything about him smacks of class and brilliance so that is why I think he can be great here

731~~~
Four actually, but I guess it was more in the manner we actually won those games and who we beat along the way (Liverpool, City, Spurs). I also think our form would have continued if Carrick didn't get injured, as he was, and still will be an integral part of our team next season.

I didn't say he's a better option there. I said he's someone who provides something different. I mean, Herrera would never have been able to offer us what Fellaini give us at the end of last season and vice versa. 

I wouldn't have Andy Carroll, because I don't rate him as a player, but if we were to get another striker, i'd like him to be someone who offers something different to Rooney. So I guess the answer to your question is yes.

732~~~
Yep it's clear that Van Gaal the biggest pull(Nothing wrong with that)but nice of him to say it was the club first.

The kraut comment was so odd/great(The idea that this was how Rooney introduced himself to Bastian) . Strange he seemed like he had no idea what it meant.

733~~~

His girl was playing a warm up tennis tournament in Birmingham prior to Wimbledon.

Just in from work and going through a few pages here. Loved Basti's interview. So articulate. Not surprised he speaks very good English - the Germans usually do. But mostly impressed that he seems so happy to be here. Actually believe him when he says it was a dream of his to come here. Am so happy<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

738~~~
Exactly, Fellaini offers something different, when you need something different. If you use him all the time, then it stops being different.

739~~~
thing is he is not there to enjoy the fruit of his genius

740~~~
Well sometime you really can tell if one is genuine or not. What he said about our club, history and one which is used to winking titles. None of them are made up or just saying it to please the fans.  To be honest, what players do not make it their dreams to play for us one day? But that's not the point, did you see the picture tweeted by his brother showing them wearing united shirts? It must have been taken at least 10-12 years ago if not longer. His admiration of the club should not be doubted given this background

741~~~
He had an old picture showing he wore a united shirt! Enough said. 

Also here's his tweet:

And I agree. Jus pointing out to someone that if he ends up becoming first choice then our supposedly complete midfield has failed miserably.

he got himself sacked so that LVG was appointed, because he knew the chances are bigger to sign Bastian with LVG in charge. It was all part of the master plan.

746~~~

747~~~

Shame he couldn't reunite with his flying dog Falco, one year too late Bastian!

749~~~
Badstuber visited him yesterday prior to his departure.

750~~~
This signing got me so excited, that while getting drunk on Saturday night, me and the missus planned a trip to Old Trafford for the match against Southampton, in January. I've already purchased the tickets.
All that's left is buying plane tickets from Iceland.

Can't wait! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

I really liked the pics of Schweinsteiger talking with Podolski's son after the world cup final. He really seems to be a likeable guy.

For example that one: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/wm-sieg-vor-einem-jahr-ein-abend-in-rio-1.2563282-17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/wm-sieg-vor-einem-jahr-ein-abend-in-rio-1.2563282-17</a>

Basti <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

He is without doubt the most German looking person I've ever seen, well him and Muller. 
Stick him in a WWII epic and they'll be an Oscar for casting.
Can't wait to see him make his debut, OT will be roaring when he takes the field. 
Hope he can stay injury free, I have my doubts though

756~~~
It is said to please the fans. What is really felt might be a different thing - or not? He for sure knows what he has to say...

And the kits say nothing - yes, his brother was a fan and we know. Else his father was selling the kits and I would not be surprised to see kits from him in various colours...

There is a lot you can believe... but some is more drama than anything. The beats advertising from Saturday/Sunday should tell you a lot. He is grown up in a time in which the EPL was still the biggest somehow. The younger players tend more to Real or Barcelona... We all know that he always thought about making this experience abroad and that he prefers England - and yes, United was for him the logical choice especially as it is the club with the biggest reputation. Schweinsteiger does not go small...

If you wanted to visit Schweinsteiger in the recent 5 years you had to press the ring for the top floor... - "Cantona"... - Schweinsteiger was a Cantona fan and had it as an alias. And that is something you can really believe in.

What an absolute monster signing.. Buzzing is a very simple word to describe how I am feeling right now..<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

We finally sign a German player and that too the captain of the reigning world champions..

Over all these years, I have only had one number on the back of all my United shirts.. 20, because of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.. 

For the first time, I am going to get the name and number of whatever Bastian Effing Schweinsteiger is going to get.. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

That is how much I Love this signing.. 

If he ends up getting 20.. I think I'll just burst into instant tears of joy over the whole week!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But considering what Ole did back in 99' vs Bayern, I very much doubt he will get 20!!

758~~~
My question to you is: What's wrong with you?! Why not just take what he said at face value and accept him with open arms, and believe he does have his dream became true and he will be happy here. 

Well thanks for this bit of information of his Cantona buzzer.... as if we don't love him enough already. 

My own confession is, his signing is my own dream coming true. I grew up in a household (well my mum basically) watching Germany as our second international team. I have liked Basti alot for years and admire him. This signing is very important as I have been a big fan. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

759~~~
Do not know what that guy is on about, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin are clearly and upgraded over blind and fellaini, there is not even a debate. Last season was a indication we need better upgrades over what we had last year, when we relying on carrick to stay fit, or the machine completly falls apart

760~~~
Well I found him look more like Scandinavian though. Can pass off as a Swedish or Danish (but he's not as tall)

761~~~
He's a Bayern fan and knows him a lot better then we would... And what he says is likely true and makes sense anyway. He's obviously a lifelong Bayern fan, but always had the goal to play abroad one day and united is a logical choice.

762~~~
I liked the part where he remembered the fans applauding them when we went out and he thought that one day he would like to play for those fans. 

I've paraphrased but the intent is there.

763~~~
Well thanks for explanation. I did not know he's a Bayern fan. I feel sorry for him losing such a loyal figure who's also a leader, which is very very difficult to replace.

My point is, there is no need to knock off how he was only saying all those things to please United fans. All footballers want their fans to love him and it is very natural he did what he did, plus the extra information that he's wearing a United shirt in an old photo (not a Chelsea or Pool shirt etc) which adds to his credibility.

764~~~
Still hasn't sunk in. Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!

765~~~
I know, right?! Cheers Bayern <span style="color: white">and feck Juventus</span>

766~~~
I liked that part too. He remembered it and truly was speaking from his heart. United is a special club and OT is an unique place.

767~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, I believe he's being sincere 100%, in that united was only ever the other club he'd go to. Just everyone knows and I'm sure he'd have no problem saying Bayern will always be his #1 team. But United is a club that suits him perfectly as we are very similar to Bayern in a lot of ways, and it just makes sense for him to play for united.

768~~~
It is exactly that - but I am a "she".
<b>
And do not mix German and Bavarian, please... </b>

I like Schweinsteiger - but I am not disillusioned about him. He is a drama queen... - and he is so great in it that you can admire him because of that. And he is finally a professional who takes care what he does - maybe a lot more than in the past when he made a lot of mistakes. Lahm is the flawless - Schweinsteiger is not. Some of this is the reason why the later somehow is loved a lot more. Schweinsteiger is the one with the black fingernails, the different haircuts, the one that needed time to grow up, the one who showed his "cousin" the jacuzzi in the trainings ground at night and got caught - and had some times when the life in Munich kept him away from being a real good professional. The one whose performances sometimes were great before 2009 - but a very long time weren't and you asked yourself why he is playing. If you watch them for ages or since they are young you see their strength and their flaws. Sometimes you know more when you know about the background, too.

You get a great player. And I sure wish him well. I will watch him whenever I can (if Bayern let's me). It might have been the right time for him to change place. It could be that he might have stayed if they would have sweet talked him in Munich - but they did not. As it is he did what he always had as an option.

769~~~
didn't Lahm have that notorious autobiography?

770~~~
I know it's photoshopped but  I think the jersey is pretty close to the leaked one for next season and it's fecking ace

771~~~
Looks great in that picture, new kits always look so much better on the players.

772~~~
Thanks for the information. Of course everyone (fan) has their respective preference of players and views of them. I am just hoping that with your knowledge about him and with your familiarity of Bayern, you will be here to fill us in with more positive (than negative) but I can understand you might feel more inclined to be less supportive of him now than when he's a Bayern player. 

I personally would have no idea how I can cope if say Giggsy had left us for Bayern when he's 30. We are very lucky it hadn't happened. And like you said, Basti might not have been sweet talked by Bayern (not very German if they did sweet talk him, may I add! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> otherwise he would still be a Bayern player. 

The way I see it, Lahm is a less flamboyant figure and he must have been a rock in the team! Very solid eh!

773~~~
Well, looks like I'm going to be watching Manchester United games, too, now. Happy for Basti and I hope you enjoy him as much as we did. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

774~~~
Words can't express how much I love Bastian already.

I cannot fecking believe he plays for us.

775~~~
I'm still in disbelief. Sat here shaking my head.

Bastian..

776~~~
Yes, but in hindsight this autobiography is even seen very positively.

Lahm is just the model professional since he is a teenager. Schweinsteiger was the one who tested all the limits and lived his "puberty" in the club. 

Maybe you can say that Lahm was boring - whereas Schweinsteiger was not. Lahm is liked - Schweinsteiger is loved. 

I have told it before - I think that he is a steal for your club. He is interested to get a good climate in the dressing room with a very flat hierarchy and is very social. He is somebody with mountains of experience on the pitch, can read the match, can play multiple roles when necessary and I think he would not transfer if he still would be troubled with old injuries.
It is a win-win situation.

777~~~
Someone has probably pointed this out already, but the 13th July has got to be just about his favourite day of the year at this stage.
Wins the world cup 12 months to the day before he signs for United <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

778~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


Me too. Surreal.

779~~~
I'm definitely at that stage. Its basically taken him 24 hours, and 1 interview, to take me from skeptical to absolutely loving the man.

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

780~~~
I think signing Schweinsteiger brings many more positives than his effect on the pitch. It might pave the way for German players to come to old Trafford and I think it has given us a good relationship with Bayern which hopefully lasts.

781~~~
Rooney shouldn't have dived and gotten him sent off. Its not the United way, it just didn't look right.

782~~~
You are just over the moon because we signed Schneiderlin too. Otherwise you would be moaning all the time here.

783~~~
I don't like when our rivals dive to win penalties but seeing one of our own do it makes me feel really disappointed.

784~~~
second

785~~~
We needed another midfielder because relying on Carrick/Bastian to stay fit all season would have been a huge risk. The Schneiderlin signing now gives us that security.

I was never against us signing Bastian (and said so many times) nor have I ever doubted his quality (again, something I said many times). I'm just delighted we've got both.

786~~~
To be fair to <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a>, future proofing ourselves was a more than sensible thing to do and has made this signing all the sweeter. In saying that, it's Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger... probably the best box to box midfielder in the world and if he's not no.1 anymore then he's certainly top 3.

787~~~
Bastian was the last player I thought we would get ever much less this window.

788~~~
i Would honestly love to see cam footage of the current squad recieving news of these transfers, Imagine Wayne, angel, juan and David getting told "Yeah we've just signed Bastian and Morgan" I reckon they'd be dancing about.

789~~~
Huh? You never doubted his quality, but you were worried about his injury record and his age. You wanted Schneiderlin more than Schweini. Now that we got them both, obviously your worries have disappeared. When the Schneiderlin situation looked bad, you were crying over there and said that Schweini alone isnt enough.

<a class="username" data-user="2525, @Kevin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/2525/">@Kevin</a>  is right, out with the non believers. Reaping our rewards now, in a time where we suffered and never complained. Now we cant even enjoy that they joined us, because some posters cried all the time about the lack of Schneiderlin and Schweinsteigers issues (using us for a new contract, injuries, age etc...)

And I still stand by all of that. And judging from the fact he signed both, so does LVG. 

Bastian is now basically a massively low risk, high reward signing. Which is perfect.

796~~~
Rooney and Rojo! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Perfect.

This is very interesting, Raphael Honigstein very clearly saying that the fee is close to €15 million and no where near the reported figure of €20 million.

801~~~
Bild said that too on Sunday, 15m Euros.

802~~~
Good point there. The current German batch, and future ones for that matter, are excellent and it's time we started tapping into that market more. Hopefully, Schweinsteiger having a successful career here, would make the club a more appealing prospect for other Germans. Not to say that it isn't as it is, but Schweinsteiger's high profile move would probably help in that regard.

It's also great to have an authoritative and imposing presence in the dressing room after the likes of Evra, Rio, Giggs and Vidic left 2 seasons ago. Rooney leads more by example with his work rate on the pitch, but isn't exactly your conventional leader, so to say. Great to have Schweinsteiger's influence in the dressing room now, esp with the rather young-ish team that we possess currently.

Needless to say, he is a terrific player on the pitch as well. It's hard to find a proper dominating midfield general nowdays, who also has the expansive passing range, tactical nous and the technique to go along with it. Just giddy with excitement here and fingers crossed, he keeps his fitness levels up and maintains his performance levels for another good 3-4 years.

803~~~
We should sign into his contract that he has to wear a bandage around his head in every game

804~~~
I really really love him, still can't believe it.

805~~~
this man cost us less than what the dippers paid for Mario Balotelli

806~~~
Or Joe Allen and Adam Lallana <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

807~~~
He comes across so well and passionate about United in his interviews. Can't wait to see him pull on the jersey. Exceptional player who can hopefully show his best with us.

808~~~
Just watched his interview with MUTV. What a guy. I wouldn't mind if he was made captain to be honest.

809~~~
Really impressed by the way he came across in that interview. Could easily turn out to be the best signing of the summer.

810~~~
Agreed, he says the right things.

I'm sure some nutter was ready to explode to the world that "Schweini only joined for LvG" but here he mentions the club as a whole.

811~~~

...and just for the fun of it.

812~~~
Yep, It sounds like he understands what the club is about and buys into it.

813~~~
"Krauts" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

814~~~
Lets just hope he does better injury wise. Somehow i doubt it but hopefully atleast 25-30 league games.

815~~~
Again, doesn't overly matter. Just imagine he plays the games that Carrick was injured for last season. Even if they both get injured at the same time, we have Schneiderlin.

816~~~
Still can't believe it. This one will take a while to sink in.

817~~~
Exactly. If he starts ~33 games, he can feature in most of our CL matches and more than half of our PL ones. Similar for Carrick. They won't both be needed all the time, vs every opponent and that's a good thing for any club that expects to rotate a bigger squad.

818~~~
Don't just read the statistics, <a class="username" data-user="62494, @Blackwidow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/62494/">@Blackwidow</a> has explained Schweinsteiger had an old injury problem with painkillers to guarantee playing at the WC. After that he got it fixed and a long rest combined a nasty tackle and an illness. He also doesn't believe Schweinsteiger would risk a transfer if he wasn't fully fit. He should have the same chance of getting injured like everyone else.

819~~~
We're fecked then <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

820~~~
No evidence to support this, but it would be illogical to leave a trophy-winning CL contending machine to go anywhere else but Madrid or Barcelona if you knew you were only likely to be able to play 25-30 games a year. Presumably you'd want to maximize the importance of those games.

821~~~
I figured it was more for LVG than he suggests it was, but after that interview my guess is that he's just kind of old-school in thinking and we're not really a circus of a team like Madrid and to a guy who's been around CL football for over a decade, we're just a bigger, more serious club than Arsenal, Citeh or Chelsea.

Sort of like the reverse of the Shaw interview where he said the 2010 WC was the first one he watched or when some young players says Neymar was his childhood hero.

In Keane's first bio he talks about going to Juventus or Bayern and you get the sense he thought those were the only other serious clubs where the culture, players and tradition were comparable or superior to what he had.

And we've been interested for a while and Barcelona (who have everything else I said) weren't, and Serie A has dropped a level.

822~~~
So we got him for close to £10M? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

823~~~
Still can't believe he signed, and for such a cheap fee. I am slightly worried (for once). Mainly his age and recent trouble with injury. However, I'm sure he'll still be good for us.

824~~~
The Germans (Bild and Honigstein) say so.

825~~~
Don't worry, the English press will change it to 30 million quid sooner or later.

826~~~
I kind of feel bad for my Mrs. When my mate was over watching the WC last summer, every time the comentator said Bazza's name we had to shout SCHWEINSTEIGER!! in a 'German' accent. The Mrs actually said she was glad the WC was over because of that. 

I said to her before, guess who we just signed today? ... SCHWEINSTEIGER!

Not happy

827~~~
Here it is. Absolute steal

828~~~
In that interview he sounds pretty confident that he's fit and will remain so. I don't know the specifics of the last year, but it sounds like he said he had a bad injury that put him out of action until October and has been fine since then

829~~~
What makes Honigstein reliable?

830~~~
Nothing. Bild is reliable in this case.

831~~~
He looks very calm, articulate, charming, nice, friendly, genuine and classy... What more could you ask of <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

832~~~
Forgot about that, I am sure by the time the mail have finished they'll have added his air fair and the price of what he had to eat on the way over to jack up the total.

833~~~
Oh that is beautiful. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

834~~~
I have a strong feeling he will fit in perfectly. He said, "one last dream in my career comes true" - heart warming and genuine. He and Giggsy have a lot in common too. He will help the team lift trophy next season. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

835~~~
Can't see this anywhere on this page so....

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger

836~~~
The best thing I like about that interview is he doesn't say "Manchester United are the biggest club in the world". He keeps it real by saying they're a really good club and they have history. 

Seems like a no nonsense guy which I love. Also, does anyone think his injury record will improve if don't play him week in and week out? We have Schneiderlin, Carrick, Herrera, Blind, Fellaini and Mata so really he wont have to be playing EVERY game. Used a bit lightly it could be the best signing of the season.

837~~~
Watch the basketball video above... - that is the other side of him... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> He is just one of the lads... 

If you are a lad that has grown up at Bayern - the history of a club is important for you. And he is not the guy that comes from a small club to a big club - but from a club that has its own big self confidence...

838~~~
nice interview. his english is very good too. and now i realize germans do speak excellent english (i.e michael schumacher)

839~~~
He did say he had a hard World Cup (of course he led his team reach the holy grail). It's not surprising where those injuries came from that required so long to recover. Really can't wait to see him on the pitch.

840~~~
I don't think I have ever seen the caf this happy and I have only been here 3-4 years.It's way too much positivity for a united fan to handle. Sign Ramos and we might have to shut down the site just for a cooling off period.

841~~~
This is very true. His move from a club with rich history and success is almost seamless as he will adapt easily. He will treasure his time here for sure and hopefully for a very long time.

842~~~
available for about 60% which is not that bad.

as for last season he had a tough and tiring world cup but still managed to make more league appearances than most of our midfielders.

plus with the options that we've got now..if we sign bastian alone then i would be a bit worried (about his recent injuries), but now with morgan as well, to add to carrick, herrera, blind, fellaini, pereira<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

843~~~
Daily Star printed something that he's on 13mill a year, that can't be right can it? reports from Germany were for about 1/2 that type of figure?
It's the Daily Star so I'm assuming it's BS..

844~~~
That figure from the star must be before tax or something. I think it might £7-10 a year.

845~~~
If he plays 60% of the matches this year it will be a success in my mind, considering that the before this summer the majority would say that he would play 0 matches for Manchester United. 

Beside that, he's playing under a manager who knows him and his abilities best, and knows how to manage him. LvG wasn't the main pull (and we should be happy about that), but LvG is the right manager for him.

846~~~
Taken from ESPN, not sure if reliable

Q: The fee for Schweinsteiger has been reported as €20 million. Was it really that high?

A: No, it wasn't. It's a nice, round sum that looks good on paper. Bayern didn't want to be seen as selling too cheaply, for fear of appearing as if they're dumping one of their talismans; and Manchester United are quite happy for it to be bandied about, for the opposite reason. The actual fee is much closer to €15 million.

847~~~
Glad to hear it.

I suspect the fact we have also landed Schneiderlin has soothed your concerns...?

848~~~
WoW! Having respectful, decent, players like this ginger chap must go a long way to fixing our clubs profile in other teams' players minds.

849~~~
Schtatistics <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> That makes Carrick the least valuable of the bunch!

850~~~
15 mil. euros? Red alert in BBC HQs,they need to react quickly and say how its more like 20 mil pounds or some shit like that.

851~~~
I'm sure if you look at the defensive stats you'll find Carrick's numbers are better.

852~~~
Even though BBC is very reliable, it's quite shite with numbers.

853~~~
18 of those games he was out because of a big injury. He is not that injury prone.

854~~~
Schweinstiger's idol is Cantona.  Cantona's name is reported to be on Bastian's door bell.  Look at 1.50 mins onwards.  Familiar?

I live in fecking Germany!

856~~~
same here, shit is blocked.

857~~~
OK, not being funny here but are we saying "key passes" isn't that Carrick's thing?????? 
You can discount Schweinstiger as it was a different league but do not tell me that ball-shy Fellaini had a better "key pass" success rate last season – or stats aside, a bigger influence on any game they played together.

858~~~
And I can see it, lol. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Knobends at GEMA strike again cnuts!

860~~~
Honestly, who cares? We signed Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger. €15 or €20 million, even he isn't in his prime, he's still Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger, not James <i>saywho?</i> Milner

861~~~
I love Schweinsteiger already the delicious bastard <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

862~~~
OK, so then you can tell me what exactly happens at 1.50? Does he ring the bell and start singing <i>"Ooh-Aah-Cantona"</i> while munching on Funny-Frisch Crisps (a brand I thought was called <i>Fanny Fresh</i> for the first few months I was here btw)

863~~~
If it had been a choice we'd have been better off with Schneiderlin (age, injury concerns, doubts over best position, motivation etc), but it's great business bringing in both.

864~~~
Great post, HD thanks!
1:07 he even purrs like a tiger! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

865~~~
dont know what bbest meant, maybe he has a similar style like Cantona. From 1:50 its his goals and assists.

866~~~
Cheers, so frustrating (but so German) this GEMA thing!

867~~~
Schsweinsteiger did something like that.

869~~~
Thanks, very frustrating this GEMA thing (so fecking German)
As for the pass: Eric <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> … but you gotta say there was a lot of Irwin in the finish too!

870~~~
concerned about the cantona thing. hope he doesn't start singing 12 cantonas during the games around xmas

871~~~
If the 13M was euros that is £9.25m a year at todays exchange rate which equates to about £175k a week which sounds high but perhaps when you factor in the £250k a week RVP was on and the £280k a week Falcao was on then its not that much in the grand scheme of things
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tsmplug.com/richlist/manchester-united-players-salaries-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tsmplug.com/richlist/manchester-united-players-salaries-list/</a>
Still a lot less than rooney and not that much more than Di Maria and Mata - even Ashley Young is on around £120k per week so its possible schweinstiger is on that
He was on 150k euros a week at Bayern so I would expect he has secured some sort of payrise to join united
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.totalsportek.com/money/bayern-munich-player-salaries/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.totalsportek.com/money/bayern-munich-player-salaries/</a>

though as you say its the daily star so take of 25% for sensationalism and perhaps £130k a week (180k euros) sounds a bit more realistic

872~~~
Some like to say that "statistics is the best way to lie". I believe that, while not telling the whole story, statistics can be a useful "tool", if one knows how to interpret them objectively. There are also some things in football which can't be calculated by numbers, such as off the ball movement, good positioning and the passing/ball carrying ability to connect the lines.

If you take a closer look to those stats, you'll see that key passes+assists=chances created. Which probably means that, according to squawka, a forward pass from a deeper position that gets the ball out of the defense and initiates an attacking play isn't considered a key pass statistically. key pass is a pass that creates a clear cut chance for a teammate. The ones that lead to goals are counted as assists. They both have one thing in common, they usually "happen" in the final third.

It's only logical that the holding midfielder won't get as many chances as the other midfielders to get in more advanced positions. His main job is to provide cover for his teammates. Carrick's vision and excellent passing range helped us control the tempo and improve our build up play but that can only be "proved" statistically only when you take a look at our win ratio last season with and without him on the pitch. It can be seen as a paradox but i believe it's no coincidence that all these sites mention key passes as one of Carrick's best attributes, despite their numbers telling a different story.

On the other hand, the stats show that Fellaini, although not the best player on the ball, did play his part in the final third. Not by providing assists (he has zero) but by being the only player who could hold onto the ball in the final third and generate movement from his teammates in the attacking half.

873~~~
Strange how Schtatistics can skew things eh? Even our pathetic Caf system has Fellaini at 2 assists for 2014/15

874~~~
Still can't believe he's ours!! I'm still worried Bayern have pulled a Hargreaves on us, I guess we can never really celebrate until we're hoisting a trophy! 

However, as far as marquee signings go, this is about as big as it gets. This is the biggest players at Bayern for 10 years at least, a living legend.

875~~~
Has anyone come up with Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger chant yet?

876~~~
I'm not sure this is true. I believe he took a pay cut in the summer.

877~~~
I believe he offered to in order to extend his contract 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3037670/Ashley-Young-offers-pay-cut-extend-stay-Manchester-United.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...rs-pay-cut-extend-stay-Manchester-United.html</a>
but as far as I was aware he had not actually signed a new contract yet?
certainly <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/ashley-young/profil/spieler/14086" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/ashley-young/profil/spieler/14086</a> nd other places I looked still said it expired in 2016

878~~~
No, I think it will depend on his performances in the season for a 1-year extension now. He will have to wait into the season. Remember he's also 30 now

879~~~
I can't believe in the last few seasons we've had RVP, Di Maria and Schweinsteiger in a United shirt, surreal.

880~~~
I'm really upset about his signing..........it's going to cost me a fortune this season: home and away tops with his name on the back. How much per letter? :-S

Seriously though,fantastic signing at a bargain basement price. Options in midfield, I said we have options in midfield, FINALLY.

881~~~
Absolutely.

I can now enjoy watching Bastian without that nagging feeling in the back of my head 'what if he gets injured'. Its the perfect scenario.

882~~~
I can't believe that 218 people on the site aren't excited about seeing him play for United. Bastian Feckin' Schweinsteiger baby.  I've had a permanent smile on my face since we signed him and Morgan.  

When we were linked I just thought nah another superstar using us to get a better contract at his current club. So when it was reported that we had agreed a fee and he was on his way over I was like a kid at Christmas. I still haven't come down and can't wait until Saturday morning to watch the first match of the preseason tour. 

One of the true world great players is coming to play at Old Trafford. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

883~~~
How many of those 218 are United supporters though? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

884~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!

885~~~
I doubt he will be playing much at the beginning. He just came from holidays and starts training. Maybe some minutes for the fans... 

Can even make an old quote from van Gaal about this topic. 

From this article of July 2010: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/louis-van-gaal-im-interview-deutsche-spieler-sind-wunderbar-1.976605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/louis-van-gaal-im-interview-deutsche-spieler-sind-wunderbar-1.976605 </a>
titled "German players are wonderful..." <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

<i>Ich weiß, dass ein Lahm oder ein Müller nach einer langen Pause sofort wieder gut spielen können. Aber Robben kann das nicht nach einer Woche, auch nicht Ribéry oder Kroos, auch Schweinsteiger und van Bommel werden Mühe haben. Der Anfang der Saison wird wieder schwierig, aber vielleicht überraschen mich die Spieler.</i>

<i>I know that a Lahm or a Müller are able to play immediately very good even after a long break. But Robben cannot do that after a week - Ribery and Kroos cannot do that either - even Schweinsteiger and van Bommel will have their problems. 
</i>
The interview was after the World Cup 2010 and the topic was the start of the season. It has to do with different player types, statures, abilities to regenerate and get in form. Van Gaal is smart enough to know that a proper build-up is the most important.

886~~~
I'm still hoping he get's an outing even if it's only 20 minutes at the end of the match. 

Either way I still can't wait until Saturday it's been too long since United played last. Preseason is not the same as a competitive match but it's better than nothing.

887~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I am already missing him. I´ll go mental if the caf doesn't appreciate him.

888~~~
If you pay attention, the caf has been in perpetual jizzfest the last couple of days. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

889~~~
I am just watching old vids on youtube... Here is one of a tinshootout between Basti+Holger and Lewy+Alaba - with English Subtitles (Alaba cannot loose - and Basti makes a meal out of it)

You got to get to know your players - not just when they talk smart to the media and on the usual footballing pitch... 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5DVmLc9K_EA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

890~~~
90 something page thread in the transfer forum and 23 page thread in the main forum and he hasn't even kicked a ball!

Safe to say he is getting a lot of love.

891~~~
I'm very happy with him and think we needed a signing like this as we lost so much experience in the last few seasons. Him and Schneiderlin adding to Carrick and Herrera makes us so strong in the middle and I think he, providing he doesn't break completely, will be a hit at O.T.

892~~~
Watching that video, next summer Woody should work his magic and achieve the impossible of getting Alaba. Such a brilliant player is multiple positions.

893~~~
We should sign Holger as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

894~~~
He's brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I have to say, I didn't realise how likable he was. I wish we'd signed him earlier in his career now!

895~~~
nah without Moyes we wouldn't have got close to him

896~~~
Fantastic clip! Thanks for posting. These two world best midfielders' respect for each other is heart warming.

897~~~
Was watching this video last night.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EP41pvpq4AQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

899~~~
Fantastic! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

900~~~
I'd join in.

901~~~
He will become the new scapegoat like all our signings when things start going wrong.

902~~~
Grey hair, only bought because he's van Gaal's lovechild, too old, too expensive, injury prone, too slow and his name takes bloody ages to write.. 

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

903~~~
Good point.

904~~~
LVG said something about everybody getting 45 minutes in the first game so he should play the 1st or 2nd half of the match.

905~~~
You can bet your ass that there will be people moaning about him as soon as he plays more than two side or back passes in one game. 

It's the caf after all. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

906~~~

907~~~
Probably has the biggest calfs in football. Absolutely huge

908~~~
He probably needs specially made shinpads.

909~~~
ATTENTION ladies and gentlemen, I have something very important to say;

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

That is all.

910~~~
That Chelsea final was a disaster for a lot of people. Spurs lost out on a CL place, Hazard signed for Chelsea that summer, and Bayern were denied a CL win at their own stadium.

Also, its remarkable how two of Bayern's CL wins came after they lost out in terrible fashions in the final in the previous season.

911~~~
This is how the buildup to disappointment starts.

912~~~
5 years too late but better than never I guess.

He's just a little old, he's still good! He's still good!

913~~~
Shaqiri and Basti must have been sleeping on the leg press machine.

914~~~
I'm an expert at that, ask all of my exes.

Just release the new kit along with his number already. I want to order his jersey!

921~~~
Probably not. 

Cultural lecture... In Bavaria to have strong calves or "stramme Wadln" is a beauty ideal for men. Lederhosen just really look good then...

922~~~
Count me in too.

923~~~
You get big calves from running up stairs (like a vertical marathon) or climbing mountains as in the German Alps?

924~~~
You probably do. But the reason why it is a "beauty" ideal is probably that Bavaria always was very rural and the farmhand with the more muscular body usually was better equipped for the hard work. That is the explanation I know.

925~~~
Eh? Why would you get upset? It is not like you lot have never had a bad word to say about Pirlo.

926~~~
Sign of hardwork and strength. Hopefully the same indicators do not apply to the Bavarian women!

Hmmm <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> where did you get your figures from I've lived in both places and I know where I'd rather be (or am I missing something here?
<b>
Manchester</b> (pretty damn rainy, less thunderstorms, no real snowboarding opportunities):

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/xDbfA2x.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/xDbfA2x.png"/>
<b>
Munich</b> (Wet, slightly more light rain, a lot less moderate and heavy rain… but always less wet than Manchester, a lot more stormy, and perhaps a snow-mobile required in winter):

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/JxW8Xhf.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/JxW8Xhf.png"/>

Love him already. He seems like a very 'aware' guy. Wouldn't surprise me if he went into football coaching/management/administration at some point in his life

942~~~
Rooney on Schweini.

"Bastian is a very experienced player who has won everything in the game and it’s great that he has chosen to join us and left a team like Bayern Munich to come here," Rooney told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sky.com/shop/tv/extra-channels/mutv/?DCMP=ELC-skycom_MUTV1516-AL-TourBTel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a></b> in an exclusive interview to be broadcast on Wednesday at 18:30 BST. "And Morgan as well – it’s great to see Bastian, him, Matteo and Memphis all come in and give the squad a boost. It’s exciting times and I’m sure over the next week or two it’ll be great for us to get some training sessions in and get to know each other's games.

"Bastian speaks very good English so that’s a boost for the squad, too. He’s a fantastic player, he’s shown that over the years and it’s great that we’ve got him and I'm sure he’ll be a good player for us. We had the day we first flew out when we first met Bastian and Morgan and they’ve settled in as well as they can do in a couple of days. It’s great to have them with us."

943~~~
I think Rummenigge already mentioned that if Schweinsteiger wants then perhaps there can be a future function for him at Bayern after his playing career is over.

944~~~
Schweini is the type of signing that has an RVP effect on us. I don't think the impact will be quite as big, just because he isn't plugging a huge hole anymore given we've signed Herrera, Blind, Schneiderlin and Mata in recent times, but a player of his quality and experience and "prestige" persay will be a huge benefit to the squad as a whole. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience and is exactly the type of player which can elevate a squad. They look around and they don't see Fellaini or Fletcher, they see a CL winning, WC winning, top quality midfielder.

945~~~
Ah then it's a certainty that he'll go back there at some point.

946~~~
He just seems genuinely happy to be here. Not something you can say for many players moving clubs. Almost like he's been itching to move here for years and now he's living the dream (even though he's won everything there is to win). It's fantastic. Glad we have an efficient German in the team now. Something that will surely be a good thing in the coming season.

947~~~
Not surprising if he's on the reported £275k per week being reported in the press !

948~~~
Bullshit

949~~~
Think its more like 375k per week and for that i blame your club,he saw you giving 200k per week to that turd,so he requested 175k more.

950~~~
That was the Daily Star getting £ and Euros mixed up. It's more like £170k per week

951~~~
He gets 13m Euros a year, reported by Bild and Sport1, which broke the story and reported everything correctly. 

Initially they said it was 10m, but it seems to be 13m. So that makes 190k pounds per week, but at least his fee is only 10m pounds, after saying at the beginning it was 15m.

Stop quoting the Daily star

952~~~
If Rooney is on 400k, Schweini is on 450k at least!

953~~~
Rooney will definitely be paid more.

954~~~
After we splashed 100m for Depay, Bastian is probably on around 650k a week.

955~~~
It's only fair.

956~~~
Schweini also said that this was his first trip to America which is kinda surprising.  Apparently Bayern would always do their preseason tours in Asia.

957~~~
Actually Bayern had a short tour last pre-season (a week). If I remember correctly the players who played in the world cup joined later and played a match against an All Stars team of the MLS - where Schweini got injured. He probably forgot on purpose. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

958~~~
You cannot call this a tour what the German players and Robben made. They departed early morning to the US, arrived early in the afternoon, made some interviews and a visit to the ADIDAS US HQ, played some minutes in the Allstar match and flew home in the night after the match. They were in Portland maybe 8 hours.

The other players were in the US more than a week - some days in New York and some in Portland.

Bayern goes on tour to China tomorrow - only a week to Bejing, Shanghai and Guanghou. With three matches against Valencia, Inter and Guanghou and a golf tournament in Shanghai in which Guardiola and some players will participate in.

959~~~
Someone posted them two pictures together on here, making the same point. 

Makes me wonder if Bastian is secretly a caftard <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

960~~~
A daily trip to the US with an injury on top it is then. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Doesn't change the fact that Bayern had been on tour and the way Schweini said it in his interview (that he hasn't been there and that the pre-season tours took place in Asia) is kinda misleading, imo. I agree with you that Schweini hasn't been on tour, though. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

961~~~
I guess his first footballing trip...

962~~~
Only just remembered that he scored at OT in that game too. Was a nice finish if I recall too. Ohh I'm excited to see this guy play for us!

Still feels a bit weird that he is our player now. Weird but good. Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger a Manchester United player, can't quite fecking believe it until I really see him out on the field for us. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger is a Manchester United player.

I just love how Beats by Dre has jumped on the Bastian bandwagon.

978~~~
Just to be clear I don't believe that BS is on £275k pw but nor do I believe that RS is on £200k pw. The media make stuff up - that is a fact !

979~~~
Im just putting this out there but he does have a massive nose.

980~~~
Wum

981~~~
so why did you say it in the first place? You are wumming, nothing else. You can believe whatever you want, you seem to be hurt that your club gave Sterling higher wages.

982~~~
Apologies - guilty !

Wanted to make the point about Raheem Sterlings reported £200k pw which is also bolllocks. But then I returned to the real world and my post was left hanging which wasn't my original intention.

983~~~
Please see my reply to kid777

I really don't care what my club or any clubs pays their players or what they pay for them in transfer fees. The obsession of football fans over this side of the game is baffling and the fact that the 'ammunition' used comes from the press who at best just guess is laughable.

Maybe I should have used a smiley to show I wasn't being serious.

As for BS - looks like a great signing. I wouldn't be too concerned about his age, if he stays fit his quality will shine through.

984~~~

985~~~
awwww.... finally he isnt at Bayern anymore, poor guy couldnt wait to get out of there. He is finally happy. And he really is.

986~~~
Just heard him speaking on the clip from the press conference - he just exudes class and confidence. I haven't been this excited about a signing for a long time.

987~~~
So what's his wage then? 
Telegraphs says 220k. 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11739238/Manchester-United-clear-30m-off-wage-bill-to-fund-spending-spree.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...30m-off-wage-bill-to-fund-spending-spree.html</a>

988~~~
When BILD first reported a confirmed move to Man Utd, they said something around £140k.

989~~~
Between 10M - 13M Euro's per year according to the various German media outlets who first  reported it, so about £140k - £175k. Of course, the British media converted the Euro's signs into £ and came up with £220k - £275k per week, because lol United overpaying again amirite

990~~~
The interesting thing about this tv-spot is, that it was shooted a few weeks ago. Of course it is pretty simple to adjust the spot to the transfer by the voice-over (which tells us, that Schweinsteiger will leave Munich and is heading to United, that he is looking for the big challenge, stuff like that.) Still, also the pics of the video can be seen as a story about a person leaving and starting a new phase in his life. You wonder, if his sponsors knew about his decision longer than the FC Bayern. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

991~~~
Such pettiness over a player's wages. Who cares? There are more important things to discuss...

...such as his height. Has it been settled?

992~~~
Or big nose.

993~~~
5'5

5'9 when he's angry

994~~~
Haven't seen anything from a press conference but just his initial interview and I definitely agree with the bolded part. He oozes confidence, it's quite obvious. He's going to be a huge signing for us, I have no doubt about it.

EDIT: yes, as huge as his nose.

995~~~
Me too Bastian, me too. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

996~~~
He genuinely feels so happy and honored to be here.

997~~~
By finished if you mean the finished article, then yes!

998~~~
You know what's amazing about Schweinsteiger signing for us? That we also signed Morgan Schneiderlin! These two seem so made for each other, its terrifying.

Sorry for stating the obvious, but I felt compelled to write that.

999~~~
Do we need to be worried about injuries? Everything I've read as made him out to be Hargreaves v2 almost. I thought he had quite a serious injury and was out for several months but has since come back from that but didn't play as much because of Pep?

1000~~~
I am not so sure about this either - that the club did not know that he will transfer... They atleast knew that the chances were very high. In the posters for the China trip that starts tonight Schweinsteiger was not included - and he usually was one of the front runners.

Schweinsteiger is not a "grumpy" German. He is mostly in a good mood, easy going and has zero problems to connect to new people.

1001~~~
Where did you get that from? I mean, shooting one of these in a hotelroom should take about an hour max, and some time to plan it.

1002~~~
As is Robben, but he's not on the tour either.

1003~~~
Unfortunately, I am not better than one of those "Twitter-Journalists", which means: I have no reliable source for the story, that the clip was shooted three weeks ago. I got the "info" from Bayern fans in Munich while having a beer together. So it's just Munich gossip. 

(But still it is not unrealistic, that Schweinsteiger made his decision a few weeks ago. And maybe he also told the club already back then. Furthermore: Sometimes big companies shoot different videos: One for the possibility, that the player is leaving. One for the possibility, that he is signing a new contract in Munich. Could have also happened, I guess.)

1004~~~
Robben misses because of muscle problems.

The video of the hotel room was not taken in Munich but in Cologne (actually you see a little of Cologne in that film, too) during the time he was with the national team at the begin of June. The speaker (who usually a sky speaker but does FIFA and other things, too) told that there were different takes with different scenarios in the voice recording one even being a career end.

1005~~~
Right, cheers. that makes sense actually.

1006~~~
loving him already, he just seems so genuinely happy and looking forward to a new challenge. Comes across really classy.

1007~~~

1008~~~

Is it just me or did Tevez just photo bomb that interview right before basti fell

1036~~~
That's the one thing the Caf never forgets and never needs to be reminded of. I don't think any other fanbase is as obsessed with being a big club or the biggest club or whatever as the United fans on the Caf are. It's hilarious.

1037~~~
What a great interview. Exactly the right sort of presence the dressing room needs now. Love Big Basti<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1038~~~
Do you post on Rawk or Real Madrid forums?

1039~~~
I feel very proud to have such a player in our team.

1040~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

1041~~~
I would say the opposite, a lot more fans are negative and need reminding that we're not so bad actually.

1042~~~
No need to be angry. Schweini is just overwhelmed by the greatness of our clubs. It happens.

Bayern is a big little club too, just not grandiose and majestic and not as worldwidely powerful and famous as us.

1043~~~
I'm not angry? Got nothing to do with Schweini, I've mentioned a few times in the past that I find the obsession on the Caf about how big a club United is ridiculous.

Schweini can't do no wrong for me, I'm happy for him and hope he does well, no matter what he says in a United press conference. And I have no problem admitting that United have a much much bigger following in the US than Bayern, it's just how it is.

1044~~~
No. I've read on Rawk and Bluemoon for a while but stopped because of the vile nature of so many posts on both boards. I wasn't interested at all to engage in discussions there, I loved the Caf from the moment I found it though and prefer it to all German football forums. I don't speak Spanish, so can't really read Real Madrid forums (and I'm not really interested in reading German or English Real Madrid forums), but then, why would Real Madrid fans obsess over how big a club they are? They're the biggest, it's really easy for them.

Bayern boards are almost as annoying in that regard as the Caf by the way (and much worse with a lot of other stuff).

1045~~~
Then it seems it's no different and your post was a bit of an overreaction. Madrid fans boo and whistle at their players and I'm sure they go on about being the biggest, legitimately or not. Liverpool fans have a greater feeling of self importance from what I can make out than any. Their own opinion of their support and uniqueness is in itself unique. So it's a bit odd that you find United fans going on about that so strange, as it's not really anything but the norm. Fans out big clubs tend to be proud of their club being big.

1046~~~
I cringe when new signings or staff refer to us as the biggest club in the world. We're the biggest commercial entity, but that's a slightly different thing to being the actual, <i>biggest</i> club in football (which is Real) and it seems slightly disingenuous to over-egg the point, knowing full well that's the caveat.

1047~~~
So you agree that United fans certainly don't need to be reminded of how big a club they are?

1048~~~
There's only been two people talking about how big a club United is on the last two pages of this thread, you and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

EDIT: oh and mockney too. Although he's playing down United's status.

1049~~~
The outrage is quite funny when you post that United isn't exactly the biggest the club.

1050~~~
Not the part I'm arguing.

This is:
Other fans of big clubs have the same elements. You just said the bayern forum can be just as bad if not worse. And Rawk is horrible. I don't think this place is some new level of bad in this regard.

This amuses me. It's so obviously a line you just have to say. That, and a dream come true. But it's how is these days. Marketing yo.

1051~~~
If he's shocked by the United support in America, imagine how shocked those Madrid cnuts were when they played us last season.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I know they're a bigger club than us so feck off</span>

1052~~~
I don't think they'e being briefed at all. Quotes like that usually come out of an overseas tour, where players are genuinely taken aback by the size of the following United is getting overseas. If they've previously played for the likes of Barca or Madrid then it might be nothing new (hence we never heard similar quotes from Di Maria) but for the vast majority of new signings I'm sure those sort of comments are sincere. It must be kind of mind-blowing to rock up in somewhere like Japan or the USA and see thousands of people all wearing replica shirts from the club you play for in a different continent.

1053~~~
There's no outrage. As was the case last time, there will be a few seriously and oddly downplaying us as some second rate club, and others admitting were not the most successful among all but clearly huge, and possibly the most famous/most supported.

1054~~~
The reaction to our support abroad is I'm sure genuine. The reach of this club is immense. But I was referring more to the quotes every time a player joins (not necessarily during a tour). They pretty much always say that we're the biggest club in the world. Maybe it's not briefed, maybe it's just to get the fans on your side, but it does feel really forced. Although I'm pretty sure the same must be happening at Madrid, Barca etc. and I'm sure every player who joins Chelsea calls Mourinho the best manager in the world. It's a thing.

1055~~~
Yeah I remember Marca photoshopping stadium in LA so that it seems like they were more Madrid fans. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1056~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this amused me

1057~~~
It's the same with every Liverpool signing snubbing United and every City signing saying Manchester is blue

1058~~~
If we're the only ones that do it (and we're not), the other clubs are just jealous they didn't think of it first <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Bastian is probably having a dig after suggestions he's past it. Being a big club is not just about Europe and Europe to be frank used to get some funny teams in the final. Strange days. Now Europe is just a mess purely thanks to money.

1059~~~
even when things are good, you lot would find something to argue about in an empty room

1062~~~
That last quote is from van Bommel?

1063~~~
I think the bigger takeaway from schweini's quotes is the fact that he sees himself as a dominator and defender. Probably highlighting that he is indeed here to play the #6 role rather than a more forward role. So I guess the lineups generally will be

      Carrick/schweini
Herrera        schneiderlin/fellaini

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!

Can't wait to see him tonight!

1065~~~
Where's Scholes by the way, he hasnt commented on us in a while?

1066~~~
I've been waiting for his views on our signings. Seems a shame he only seems to comment the negatives.

1067~~~
That was fecking terrible. And that was just the press. Imagine what the assholes at Real Madrid tell players when they're tapping them up.

1068~~~
So true! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1069~~~
I doubt most players sincerely mean it when they say they're happy to sign for "the biggest club in the world". Pretty much every player who signs for a top 5-10 club says it out of obligation, if not to appease the fans or the club's higher ups.

Schweinsteiger might be coming from a position of sincerity because of his sentimental view of the club (not least via his brother), but I sincerely doubt someone like Schneiderlin would say anything different at the likes of Bayern, Madrid, Barca or Juve.

1070~~~
Lets hope he can stay fit and relevant. I'm not really sad to see him go, but it still just doesn't feel right...

<a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a> 
Who will be the new "Fußballgott"? I vote for Müller.

1071~~~
Remember when they photoshopped the stadium, so it had more white shirts? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1072~~~
Love schweinsteigers attitude , I can`t see him looking dejected and giving up when things aren`t going well like Di Maria appeared to do last year . With the players we`ve signed and possibly a few more to come we are looking well set to have a good go at home and in europe with a squad big enough in quality to cope with injuries and suspensions .

1073~~~
I think Barca are the biggest right now and have the biggest pull for potential new recruits.

1074~~~
Why? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
If you mean that standard "oh my new club is soo big" comment I couldnt care less. <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Bayern grew so much in the last 5 years and United had so many troubles. Im fine. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Btw; we all hate to admit it but Barca and Real have their own special league. So I always get a laugh out of the English hype comments about United.
How they tried to make Schweinis transfer a sign for their stupid "United is above Bayern" storyline.
Yeah. Go on about it. We buy Vidal, Costa and di Maria and go much deeper in the CL. If you qualify of course. <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1075~~~
I like this transfer already. Bayern's legend signs for us and immediately says we're bigger than they are then United fans get bollocking from bayern fans for daring to listen to it. No sour grapes at all and he hasn't even kicked a football yet. Now isn't that delusional.

1076~~~
Things getting prickly in here with our German comrades, both clubs are pretty! 

That's never more evident than in the transfer forum.

1077~~~
He also pointed out how he and Louis van Gaal lost to United at Old Trafford <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

(Yes I know Bayern went through on away goals)

And then he spoke of 1999.

The fans at Old Trafford will love him. Can't wait to see the cheers he gets.

1078~~~
Wasn't Schweini talking about Manchester United being bigger than Bayern in regard to global standing, especially in Asia and USA? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> I'm not offended by a fact.

1084~~~
There are things you shouldn't joke about. I should know, I'm half german.

1085~~~
I wasn't joking. I think if Pep is still there and playing him on the wing he will want to leave next year.

1086~~~
He never complained about playing on the wing, especially since he rarely did so under Pep. He played way more games as RW under Heynckes and Löw. Doesn't matter where, he just wants to play. And I think (and hope) that the club would rather let go of Pep than Müller. A coach that doesn't field Müller whenever he's available just doesn't get it.

1087~~~
I still want him next year.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Don't want... I'm sulking.

1091~~~
You're not hurt at all...

1092~~~
Bayern fans seem incensed, absolutely enraged. The infuriation on show is shocking. Throw your death arrows Schweini's way guys, not our fault that he felt like telling the truth after experiencing the grandiosity of the biggest club in the world. Bayern is big too, calm down.

1093~~~
Released a statement on facebook regarding being misquoted/words out of context.

Probably seen this thread and he's trying to stop WW3. Damage control at it's finest.

1094~~~

1095~~~
Learned his lesson. Never talk to the British press.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1096~~~
Ups I thought it was LA somehow. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> But so so small time by Marca. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1097~~~
Yeah, I said the same. Which makes claims like the following even more silly:

Sour grapes, ffs. I don't think I've said one bad word about Schweinsteiger or United and several times wished both him and the club success together. In fact, all the German fans on here, all the Bayern fans are incredibly respectful towards Schweinsteiger and United. I was pointing out that United fans needed to be reminded of 'how big a club United really is' is a bit ridiculous, if you consider the countless 'we're the biggest club in the world' comments on the Caf. I actually agree with Schweinsteiger's statement. That's how delusional I am.

1098~~~
So true and so irritating.

1099~~~
calm down folks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1100~~~
Actually in the case of Schweinsteiger I do believe that it is a dream come true. Not that he didn't like it at Bayern and dreamed of leaving all these years...obviously that's not the case at all, he's a legend there and he loves the club...but what I mean is: Schweinsteiger has while being respectful to Bayern and their fanbase often mentioned that he'd love to get the "abroad experience" at some point during his career. He's emphasized how it's not a decision against Bayern but it'd be a life decision for him to at one point move abroad and try that out for a bit as well. Kinda so he can see more of the world. In regards to that I always had the feeling that when and if he moves, he eyed a move to United. He's always respected United and I can't see him going to a club like City for example. I don't think Barca really appealed to him in his prime and I think Madrid might've seemed a bit too chaotic and crazy for him as well. So it did always seem to me that while he had the dream of taking Bayern to the very top and becoming a club legend there, he also for a long while now had the secret dream of going on something like an adventure in a different country (going to United).

1101~~~
I love how we get told we're the only ones that say we're the biggest and then everyones saying their clubs bigger. Two great clubs but Munich should really sell us more players.

1102~~~
I'm pretty certain that's close to what he's trying to say. The way it's reported makes it seem like he's throwing 'shade' at Bayern. He's way too respectful as a person to do that. The truth is Man Utd are pretty big commercially worldwide, and he's probably more commenting in that general direction.

1103~~~
You can have Kirchhoff... Probably even without any fee... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1104~~~
It'll be nice when there's some performances to discuss in this thread.

1105~~~
Knowing van Gaal he'd ask for Badstuber. Or is he still permanently injured?

Kirchhoff always was a beast for me on FIFA, on that basis I'd sign him <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1106~~~
Deal. In return, you can have Blackett.

1108~~~
Is it the first time a famous footballer's words have been twisted out of context??

1109~~~
But right now a lot of fans look at every word he says as a lot might feel betrayed...

Some blame Pep or Rummenigge - some do not like that video and that he did not say Good Bye personally as he still was in Munich Saturday and did the easy way out without showing emotions.

------------------

Else we do everything right now to overtake you in China - you can have the USA... We have unfair weapons as we sent Müller and Neuer into China's biggest sports TV show...



They had fun...

living in Asia, I'm quite angry since this place seems to have been neglected by United for some time
Ironically, the most recent famous guy to come here is Pep Guardiola on a secret holiday in June...

1112~~~
Every single day I wake up with a smile on my face.  Bastian Schweinsteiger is a United player.  Writing that gave me goosebumps.

1113~~~
bit of a shitter had to justify his comments, he's more than qualified to say it

1114~~~
More popular in China according to this too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26049330" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26049330</a>

1115~~~
in the 2000s, there was a time when I opened CCTV-5 (national Chinese sports channel) and every time I saw a match featuring Inter Milan. They were really the most supported foreign team in China back then. how times change

1116~~~
Lahm vs Basti will be special if there's a match in CL. For Bayern fans in this forum, you may like this..

1117~~~
He was confrontated with this in the press conference today. He said "did he say that?" - and said, that Bayern was better when it means the sports side.

In my eyes both are right...

1118~~~
There is no way that Depay and Schneiderlin are on £150k a week. Darmian at 100k seems really dodgy too...seems like its all bullshit

1119~~~
that put Memphis' and Morgan's equal to Di Maria's<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1120~~~
The wage they made up for Depay is really dumb. I mean he was probably on €20-30k (I guess) in Holland and Woodward decided to give a largely unproven 21 year old a wage of €216k. 

<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> Have the dutch media reported the wage for Depay? The great English journalists have went for €216,000 a week

1121~~~
De Telegraaf (who I don't rate particularly high since they never mention sources so it's always a gamble wether it's true or bollocks) said he's on 120k Euro per week. VI who are trusted haven't mentioned it.

1122~~~
For now Schweinsteiger is #23! Oh feck yeah! My favorite number.

1123~~~
I will say this again: 

Seeing Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger in a United shirt. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> My life is now complete!

1124~~~
It has begun!

1125~~~
It looks weird. He has fitted in seamlessly

1126~~~
He's king.

1127~~~
He's got a bubble butt.

1128~~~
He's so fecking good, to think some people were disappointed saying he's too old <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 30 is nothing

1129~~~
He was bought for cheap to provide depth and experience to our midfield. It's not like he's expected to play 40-50 games a season. There is literally no downside to this transfer- I don't get why so many journos are pessimistic about it. Probably because it's United.

1130~~~
What a pass that was to blackett! No time but still manages it! Bastian fecking Schweinstiger

1131~~~
He looks like he's carrying some holiday weight.

1132~~~
pure class

1133~~~
He really has presence when he's on the pitch. A real leader.

1134~~~
His drive, tackling and movement is class. This is closest we're going to get to a complete midfielder for a while.

1135~~~
Classy player. Just finding his feet but clearly going to be a huge asset to us assuming he can stay fit. There are going to be alot of selection headaches for LVG in midfield.

1136~~~
Class, class, class. 

So good under pressure. Dream signing

1137~~~
He has just has that extra class on the ball. With him and Herrera on the ball I can see teams really struggling  to be the ball off us.

1138~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/481163570-bastian-schweinsteiger-of-manchester-united-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXnyJIHjMQJvrMEx8SEdGU9VwdmsVqAaTcI%2fXLs2vHVMQ6T6CD3n4idE4WnQXSIW73A%3d%3d" src="http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/481163570-bastian-schweinsteiger-of-manchester-united-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXnyJIHjMQJvrMEx8SEdGU9VwdmsVqAaTcI%2fXLs2vHVMQ6T6CD3n4idE4WnQXSIW73A%3d%3d"/>

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1139~~~
You can tell his class just from the minutes he played today, yes it was error strewn but the way he can see passes and go past players in midfield was very impressive. His game was rather restrained under Pep.

1140~~~
He looked a bit fat tbh.

Too much sauerkraut or whatever bravanians eat

1141~~~
Looking forward to seeing a trio of Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Herrera. Has incredible potential.

1142~~~
There were bound to be more errors in the seconds from him and Herrera than the first half duo, given the amount of youngsters on the pitch and hence the less restraint more all over the place second half.

1143~~~
Yep agreed, still impressed by him.. he clearly has 'legs' and that is a sigh of relief.

1144~~~
He totally owned the midfield like a boss.. and that he did it only after a few preseason training with us.

Really excited what he is going to do after the season started and what LVG plan for our midfield but I reckon Schneiderlin will be automatic starter with either Carrick or Scheweini to partner him up.

1145~~~
I'm really excited to watch him in the premier league. I do love a midfielder who can operate in tight spaces and doesn't <i>have</i> to pass when someone gets close.

1146~~~
Just looked class everywhere on the pitch. Cannot wait to see him with Schneiderlin and Herrera in a midfield 3, that is if LvG doesn't start experimenting with the formations again.

1147~~~

1148~~~
He was in England during his holidays...

Sauerkraut is good at diets... 23kcal on 100g

1149~~~
While I've always thought Schweinsteiger was one of the top 3-5 CMs in the world, today he showed a level of class I haven't seen at United since Scholes. Sure he faded as the half went on but his close control and pass creativity were refreshing to watch. Herrera seemed to also show a similar level of poise (which we saw last season too) and I hope to see those two combine more as the tour goes on (maybe with Schneiderlin also?).

1150~~~
Contract extension please

1151~~~
Really.

Thats even worse, does anyone in europe eat good food.

1152~~~
If he can stay fit, he's going to be such a calming reliable influence in our midfield. He's good....very good. Very comfortable on the ball when pressured...which to be honest, we have lacked recently

1153~~~
He should have played in shades he looked so relaxed out there, his ease on the ball no matter who is around him is great to watch.

1154~~~
Was constantly guiding the players around him. A true leader of men.

What a player for the sorts of Herrera and Morgan to learn from

1155~~~
I liked that too. And he's got the credentials to do it.

1156~~~

looks a bit like Van Gaal in that pic. It's sort of underrated how well he keeps the ball. Class player!

1158~~~
You just know by the time pre season finishes and the prem starts he is going to nail a starting spot..

1159~~~
He'll score on his premier league debut

1160~~~
What a day that would be!! Imagine him scoring on debut and everyone in OT shouting "Fußballgott" <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Now that would be something.. Hope we haven't jinxed him..<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1164~~~
Just wanted to say

Bastian FECKING Schweinsteiger!!!

1165~~~
The amount of control passes he provided whilst under pressure were just a joy to behold. Always available for passes and great vision. Almost feels like Scholes playing there. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1167~~~
He's so calm and composed in that midfield he doesn't panic! He's amazing!!!

1168~~~
Thats the post I remembered.

1169~~~
He really is a class act, didn't even look as if he was sharp and yet his passing and technique were clear to see. There was times that he was holding the ball like he was playing against kids and then just played it simple. Can't wait to see him in some bigger and harder matches.

1170~~~
I already miss him so much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. I guess I have to watch more United games this season.

1171~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> excellent.

1180~~~
Sad to see him go instead of Alonso, I would say. Both past their primes, but Schweinsteiger being a local hero. Schweinsteiger was at his best between 2009 and 2013, with a last hoorah at the 2014 WC. Since then, from a non-sentimental point of view, it made sense to let him go Because we need a rebuild and he isn't good or reliable enough to play the part of the mentor. Lahm is better suited to this and we are able to get a real top player for midfield.

1193~~~
Yeah, no good food exists in Europe...

1194~~~
Still can't get over the fact he's in our midfield.  I think pre sunmer I would have been happy enough with just Schneiderlin but having watched them today.. An injury free Schweini is the best midfielder we could have got this summer, my doubts about his fitness have been dispelled and he looks imperious.  Technically a level above any midfielder we have, key signing. . I think if we got Ramos he'd have a similar impact for the defence.

1195~~~
And I called the reasons as a lot of ballot there too

1196~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wanted to add your post too, to balance things out.

1197~~~
Bollox not ballot 

Damn auto correct

1198~~~
Pre-season numbers aren't official, right?

1199~~~
No.

1200~~~
No but I think he'll stay with the same number.

1201~~~
I think he was decent really, just look a bit slow but great handling of the ball and good vision. I think we won't see Carrick and him in many games playing together. Imagine Schneiderlin and Herrera sweeping around him, that's my starting midfield three, awesome energy and creativity in it..

1202~~~
Yeah, that sounds about right. What were Darmian and Schneiderlin? Missed the game. I know Memphis was #9 but I doubt he'll keep that.

1203~~~
I missed it too but from what I've read Darmian was something like 36 and Schneiderlin was 27. Darmian'll most likely change to 2 when Rafael goes and no idea about Schneiderlin.

1204~~~
15 is vacant and 6 will be if Evans leaves, those can be distributed to Bastian and Morgan. Morgan was 28 today, that won't be the case permanently for sure.

1205~~~
super calm on the ball, its beautiful to see.

1206~~~
Hope he keeps the 23 shirt. Constant reminder of progression from previous incumbent

1207~~~
He is so cool receiving the ball under pressure.  Will bring an enormous amount of stability to our back 4 to have an outlet like that.  When in doubt, give it to the Kraut!  Love this guy!!!  Now, he just needs some fitness cause he was wilting in the last 10 minute...

1208~~~
He oozes class. It's incredible to watch him create space for himself and always seems like he has bags of time on the ball. Positionally impressive defensively too. Not that any of this is a surprise of course.

1209~~~
#Philosophy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1210~~~
He was absolutely divine, first name on the team sheet.

1211~~~
One day we will play a diamond of him, Carrick, Morgan and Herrera.

His calmness on the ball and vision is great. Obviously needs a few games to get back into it (and for his team to understand his actual ability imo).

1212~~~
He seemed to have all the time in the world when on the ball. I loved his performance, different class. 

You could see his leadership skills yesterday too. I can't wait for the next pre-season game.

1213~~~
Hmmm, I see he's getting rave reviews. I'm not so convinced though (and no I don't have an agenda before anyone starts). He showed plenty of quality, but still left me with some doubts.

First of all, he was fantastic on the ball, obviously. Great touch, fantastic range of passing, calm under pressure, showed leadership etc etc But physically, I still he have serious doubts. He looked very slow and cumbersome, and looked to be struggling to get up and down the pitch (especially compared to Morgan in the first half). He also looked absolutely knackered after half an hour. Now hopefully thats just a lack of fitness/match rhythm~(Carrick and Rooney also looked well off the pace), but if its not, and he's lost his legs (for want of a better phrase) then I think the only way to use him in the PL will be as a #6. Because he will get found out very quickly playing box to box in the PL if his legs have gone. As a #6 though (especially with Morgan and Herrera providing the 'legs') he should have the freedom to control the matches. 

But yeah, seeing him in a United shirt was fecking weird <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. I thought it would feel less surreal once we saw him play, but if anything it felt more surreal.

1214~~~
It was like watching Scholes in the latter part of his career, just the whole touch, calmness, the awareness of space, the range of passing.

1215~~~
Was clearly a level above. Just oozes class. Will take a bit to get up to speed as he only just started training but I wouldn't be too worried about that. If he stays fit, he's the best midfielder in the league without a doubt.

1216~~~
Not sure about this, but hasn't Morgan had two more weeks training than Bastian? I was under the impression Saints went back to training a week before our lads gathered at Carrington, so he had a good two weeks under his belt when he joined up with the team in the US. Bastian has just trained a few times in the US, fitness will come back. I doubt his legs have gone, but we'll see.

1217~~~
As Heynckes said, "Schweinsteiger should be mentioned in the same breath as Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller." Nobody has been more influential in German football than him and Lottar Matthäus ever since.

1218~~~
I think it's better to wait for a few more matches before making projections on how he'll be physically in the PL.

1219~~~
He was good but Schneiderlin in the first half was better. Still, I'm just grateful we have both of them.

1220~~~
He can shift entire defense lines or attack lines with one turn of his hips

1221~~~
He's just come off his injury. He said he is fine now, and I believe him. When he hasn't been in form he has never stated the opposite. He knows his body more than anyone else. Give him 2 months of full match time and he will be tremendous.

1222~~~
This. Just caught up with the game and the awareness level he has is on another planet, reminds me of Scholes so much in the sense that players get close to the ball, but never close enough to win it. He always turns or moves the ball to the perfect position to shield it, then moved it on quickly and accurately. 

There was 1 part where a player closed him down from behind quickly, and with a quick look over his should saw him coming and dodged the tackle. Things like that are so under appreciated, it's amazing to watch. It's going to be great watching him.

1223~~~
first game of pre season and he hasn't trained, ffs  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1224~~~
Not to mention we didn't sign him to run around like a headless chicken.

1225~~~
He also was literally still on holiday when we signed him compared to Morgan who was already training. Club America are well into fitness. He will be fine.

1226~~~
Nice upgrade. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Many noticed that on here. I'm glad he's honest about it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> It's expected considering he played a limited amount of games last season, he's a big guy and this was only his first week back in training. Bastian will be such a beast this season. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1228~~~
<b>Another of our new signings, Morgan Schneiderlin, scored the winning goal with a first-half header. Were you impressed with his performance, and how good a player is he?
</b>
I think he was very good and he is a very good player. If you see the goal, he did it well with no foul and a nice header. I think he is a really good player and, also, for me, what is more important, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">is that he is a good boy.</span></b>

FFS Schweinsteiger, he is 25 years old <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1229~~~
It's good that he knows all the players names and can see what the younger players are like already

1230~~~
Saw this on another forum, he's followed all the other United players in strict order by playing position.

#justgermanthings

1233~~~
Ballack was easily more influential than him.

1234~~~
He looks genuinely chuffed to be here. Good to see

1235~~~
Carrick is class and all but Schweinsteiger is a level above him. If he settles we'll have a genuinely brilliant midfield.

1236~~~
If you consider longevity, yes. But I don't think Ballack ever played a tournament as great as Schweinsteiger in 2010, never had a standout game like Schweini's World Cup final in 2014 nor did Ballack ever play a season as great as Schweinsteiger in 12/13. Both were a bit different anyway, could have been fantastic to watch them together in 2010, if not for that injury which basically ended Ballack's career.

If Sammer counts as a midfielder (and he kinda should), he tops both Ballack and Schweinsteiger as the most influential German midfielder since Matthäus anyway.

1237~~~
Ballack's 02 and 08 was of a higher standard that bastians 2010, especially the former. His last season at leverkusen was better than anything Bastian ever did at club level. Ballack had many stand out games better than bastians final vs argentina. His own game vs argentina in 06 comes to mind. Slightly different, but ballack was easily superior, both in terms of peak performance and longevity. He was a player who could run the show and still be the difference maker. The team success of German and Bayern In recent years seems to be clouding your judgement.

1238~~~
No, not at all. It seems more like your 'everything was better in the late 90's/early 00's' theme is clouding your judgement and you simply can't appreciate standout performances from the past 5-10 years, let alone judge them fairly.

1239~~~
He's forgot Antonio. Gonna have to start unfollowing some!

1240~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZTjum4fca0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>


From last year. He asked for Scholesey's jersey <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1241~~~
Not for my money, but then Ballack was more of an attacking mid, second striker than a CM, at least at Chelsea.

1242~~~
Get your money on this guy to win the POTY awards from the fans and players.

1243~~~
Ballack went from being a great footballer to a butcher and a hatchet man at Chelsea.

1244~~~
That's an ongoing debate in Germany for many years.

My point of view:

(a) Schweinsteiger is the more influential player.

(b) The public opinion totally changed: In former years, Schweinsteiger was seen as talent who will never deliver and Ballack as boss. Now, it's totally different. Schweinsteiger is the man who has done it. He has won the CL and the world cup.

(c) Honestly? The public opinion in Germany is also influenced by the simple fact, that everybody LOVES Schweinsteiger. While Ballack was... well... tolerated as world class player.

And now other German speaking users will tell you that I am wrong in 3, 2,...

1245~~~
I do appreciate them, and I've always been a big Bosstian fan. At his best, he ran the midfield like clockwork but honestly, some go overboard with some of these recent players and their performances.
At chelsea he was deeper in midfield due to them having Lampard too. At bayern he was an attacking mid, but he was simply a more influential player. He held the german team together alone for many years while the others were stinking the place up.

1246~~~
Ballack didn't win the MoTM at the WC Final and IIRC, din't win the CL with any German club.

1247~~~
He held them together, but ultimately he couldn't lead them to victory, which is what Schweinsteiger did. That's the difference really, IMO at least. Both hugely influential players, but Basti had a man of the match performance against Messi and Argentina to win it for Germany. You could argue it was a better team then previous German teams with Ballack, but getting past that final hurdle means he was more influential for me.

1248~~~
That's only true for 2002 against some truely shit opponents and we actually played by far our best football in the tournament in the final when Ballack was suspended. No one held us together in 2004, we just sucked, and the whole team performed well in 2006, especially Frings in midfield who had a fantastic tournament. In 2008 we basically had one great game against Portugal and Ballack wasn't the reason why we played well. His goal in that game (which was a foul by him and we were lucky to get away with it) was crucial of course, but the clear man of the match was Schweinsteiger who was absolutely fantastic, scored the first goal and assisted the 2nd. The rest of the Euro 2008 were dire performances against minnows and a loss against the first great team we met.

At no point did Ballack ever inspire a team to play well overall the way Schweinsteiger did at his best (and hopefully will continue to do for a few more years). And that's no slight on Ballack at all. It's just Schweinsteiger has been truely fantastic since 2009 (when he wasn't injured, which he was a bit too much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> ).

1249~~~
A) obviously I disagree

B) Teams win titles, winning such trophies doesn't make him the better player or am I going to have to tolerate some Cole vs Shearer argument? Or Gerrard vs Carrick? Let's be honest, Ballack never played in a team as good as the recent Bayern and germany team. 

C) Can't add anything there.

1250~~~
Better player doesn't necessarily mean more influential... So if you're going for influential then I'd say Schweiny wins. Though I'm not sure if there is much between them as players at their best either.

1251~~~
To tell the full story about Schweinsteiger, he had to earn it. Very very very hard. He was the main scapegoat after the Euro 2012 and an utterly ridiculous media campaign made him out as the ultimate failure. The way he stepped up after it was truely special and he deserves every bit of recognition he finally gets. He was treated way worse than Ballack ever was, who despite never being loved, was always respected and admired as our only world class player in his generation.

1252~~~
How come Ballack was unloved?

1253~~~
He's not really a likeable guy. He also pissed off all non-Bayern fans in Germany when he moved to Bayern and then all Bayern fans when he moved to Chelsea. His return to Leverkusen at the end of his career turned into a disaster quickly. Not much to love about him really.

1254~~~
It does. Name me one player better than the other but isn't more influential?

1255~~~
I checked back regarding Ballack's game against Argentina in 2006 because I wasn't entirely sure how well I remember the actual game (I kinda was drunk and celebrating like crazy in one of the public viewing spots and never rewatched the game, so I could have been totally off). Anyway, kicker magazine grades players from 1 to 6 with 1 being the best grade. Ballack got a 3, Frings a 1. That's how I remember it as well, Frings was truely fantastic and the uproar in Germany after Italy used tv footage from the brawl after the game to get Frings suspended for the semifinal was huge, because many football fans believed that Frings was our best player so far in the tournament. Unless my slightly drunken memory and the most reliable German football magazine are totally useless, it's really hard to understand how you can use that game as an example for Ballack standing out, let alone believe it was better than Schweinsteiger in the final 2014, that's just silly.

1256~~~
This is a crazy way to compare players. So Ballack couldn't inspire his team to winning a match against Figo, Zidane, Makelele, Carlos, Raul while his teammates were Neuville, schneider and co and that makes him less influential? Really? 
Sadly after taking that sad germany team to the final he didn't play due to suspension. He never played in a team of similar talent levels to the other big teams in europe when he was in germany. Football is a team sport and winning titles can't make a footballer more influential than another one.

1257~~~
Frings WAS the best player in that game, by far. Ballack didn't have that much of an impact.

Disclaimer: I was sober when watching it.

1258~~~
Frings better than Ballack in 06? This convo can't go on :LOL:

1259~~~
No way.  Ballack was a #2.  Basti was a key component of the team that won the CL and the national team that won the World Cup.  Michael Ballack was overrated in comparison.

1260~~~
You make it sound as if Ballack constantly inspired a team full of shit German players to overcome quality teams. The reality is that he saved us with moments of individual brilliance twice against clearly inferior teams in 2002. And he wasn't even the best German player in 2002 either, that was clearly Kahn who saved us even more than Ballack did, won the Golden Ball at the World Cup and finished 3rd at the Ballon d'Or.

I kinda hate this discussion, because it feels like I'm downplaying Ballack, which is the last thing I want to do. I rate him highly. The story you're trying to tell about Ballack is full of holes though.

I don't think smileys can fill those holes. Nice try though.

1261~~~
The Schweinsteiger thread gets used for all kind of discussions most of the time, except for actual Schweinsteiger performances.

The comaprision Schweini vs. Ballack could be discussed in a seperate thread i think.

1262~~~
You are sounding like one of my closest Bayern supporting friends. He's always mentioned the ridiculous media campaign blaming Bastian and Lahm for the failures at club and national team level - and how hard they had to work to disprove that failure label.  Redemption is sweet.

Schweinsteiger is and was the better player than Ballack, there's no doubt in my mind.

1263~~~
It's not like there are many actual Schweinsteiger performances for United to discuss? Establishing that he's the best German midfielder since Matthäus/Sammer seems a fairly good way to fill this thread until he plays some more minutes.

1264~~~
2012 was a bad year for him, I still can't believe you couldn't beat that crap Chelsea team with the final being at home.

1265~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Neither can I.

1266~~~
Carrick was more influential for united last season then Rooney, he's not a better player though. Ronaldo isn't always the most influential player for real Madrid, Di Maria was arguably that in the run in for their 13/14 season but he's obviously not as good as ronaldo. There are plenty of examples of it. 

Anyway, how can one player not be more influential for a team then another if they won the champions league and world cup with him as the main man, while Ballack lost in all his finals basically? Meant he couldn't quite get past the last hurdle.

1267~~~
I do find it a bit funny that you're making it out as if he doesn't know what he's talking about when talking about germany and their past players, considering he's German? Correct me if you're also German, but I feel like you aren't.

1268~~~
I don't think he's German. He doesn't have to be to know about the World Cup in 2006 anyway. Here's an article in English about Frings and the incident that lead to his suspension for the semifinal:

The Guardian:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/04/worldcup2006.sport8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/04/worldcup2006.sport8</a>

It seems like he neither watched the games nor read up on them. But I'm out now, it really is a bit too far offtopic from Schweinsteiger's performances this season <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1269~~~
Those 3 EC/CL finals against Porto, United and Chelsea must have been real bummers - the way you guys lost them, I mean. Which one do Bayern fans in general class as their shittiest loss?

You guys have an excellent EC/CL record so it can't hurt so much, when taking everything into consideration that is. What is it 5 wins and 9 finals right? Phenomenal record.

1270~~~
Chelsea because it was at home. Nothing compares to that loss <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

1271~~~
It's amazing that we never crossed paths in the final between 07/08 and 12/13 when one of us was in every final.

1272~~~
Aye, was supporting Bayern for that match too and it wasn't nice seeing feckin Chelsea conjure up a win somehow. Daylight robbery it was and who knows, we might have even gotten Hazard since Chelsea wouldn't have qualified for the CL the next season. Ah well, he probably would have still gone there or City anyway, as Fergie would have never paid the agent's demands.

1273~~~
I happily decided to watch that game with my friends who are Chelsea fans coz never in a million years did I think I'd have to listen to their gloating at the end, seemed like the game was a mere formality before the kick off. One of the most bizarre CL winning campaign it has to be said.

1274~~~
Only Germans can judge german footballers correctly? Ohk.

1275~~~
What holes? He was running a german team filled to the brim with players of less than stellar talent, and did it for nigh on near a decade. Plus ballack wasn't all individual moment of brilliance, saying that just boggles the mind.  Let's put it this way, Ballack was in every international tournaments team of the tournament from world cup 02 till euro 08. That should tell you of the standard he played at.

1276~~~
Apparently we've signed Michael Ballack.

1277~~~
Obviously we look at it in total rather than breaking it into little bite size pieces. Obviously carrick at times has been a better player for united than rooney, but overall I think we all know who wins the battle. Similarly the Ronaldo/DiMaria scenario. 

He wasn't the main man in the '14 world cup. He wasn't the main man in the CL run. Have no idea what you're on about there. Besides that because football is a team sport and you have to beat opponents. That's why a footballer can be more influential than another one and not win. Certain things are out of the control of individuals as this isn't golf. Sometime a long time ago SAF said that Gerrard was the most influential footballer in english football, Gerrard didn't win much. Does this mean Totti wasn't a more influential footballer than Yorke? Or that Thiago silva is trumped by Mascherano in defence? I'll let you decide.

1278~~~
No but I'd trust their opinion on who had the bigger influence on their national team as they have followed all of their games over the years and probably analyzed them a lot closer then neutrals

1279~~~
The problem with Germans is that we have 80 million national team coaches and each has another opinion... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Actually it is the same with Schweinsteiger - there is no player who splits the opinions so much in the German Bayern forums.

1281~~~
ok RooneyLegend is a massive Ballack fan, we get it. Let's move on.

1282~~~
I don't care about Ballack, I come into this thread to have updates on Schweinsteiger.

Just create a new thread, it will keep everyone happy and is a genuine good discussion point.

1283~~~
Just read the second part of his interview on the United website, what a fecking classy guy. Just so.. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

1284~~~
Was a bit sloppy and ordinary today. Also looked slow.

Guess lack of fitness showing as he hasn't had any training yet.

1285~~~
Not much to say really. Got a bit sloppy near the end.

We've yet to see the 'fecking' in Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger, I really want to see him with actual first team players ahead of him.

1286~~~
Sloppy? Did he have more than one incomplete pass?
he was solid... He was nearly the only one who looked up and tried to move forward. Today's passing in the second half reminded me of the zombie days under Moyes.

1287~~~
He was gash today. Way off the pace.

1288~~~
Him and schneiderlin today were a bit average really, though schweinsteiger got better as the half wore on. 

Herrera and Carrick a class above the other midfielders today. Funny as on Friday it was the opposite if anything.

1289~~~
He had one sloppy cross field pass at the end. Lack of movement in front was a problem for him and the CB's.

1290~~~
Obviously feeling the strain of pre-season. Played this one out at walking pace.

1291~~~
Time to get him in the first (half) team. Seeing LVG called him bad. Couple of misplaced passes but looks so comfortable. Be good to see him with the better/more experienced team.

1292~~~
He was quite poor today. He had good ideas and intentions turbulent follow up on them. It doses not really bother me though.

1293~~~
LvG called him bad, but I felt he was more protective rather than criticism saying it is hard to adjust to a new team plus he had a lot of traininghours in his legs.

1294~~~
Just not seeing anything with him at the moment. Looked slow and a little heavy. Early days but remain cautious.

1295~~~
He looks really unfit. Tidy passing as you'd expect but he could definitely do with losing a few pounds.

1296~~~
This is what preseason is for fellas.

1297~~~
He started training later then the others and has so far played 90 minutes for us. First thing he needs to do is get fit.

1298~~~
Refreshing to see the honesty in here. Looked really casual today. Had to have a chuckle at LvGs: “He was also bad" comment! I didn't see him say it so I'm probably imagining it being more brutal than it really was.

1299~~~
You cannot possibly expect a player who wasn't even with us two weeks ago and has hardly been training this pre-season to jump into a new team and settle immediately. His class cannot be in any doubt.

1300~~~
He's got a fatter arse than Luke Shaw.

1301~~~
Always find it odd, people watching games & focusing on the physical attributes of blokes. If that's all you come away with, what a simplistic view of the world you have <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1302~~~
It just means there's more of him to love.

1303~~~
First off, a world class World Cup winner plus many titles under his belt does not turn mediocre overnight! (Caveat: Admittedly I have always been Basti's big admirer)

This morning I've watched his so called "bad" performance. You can't really say he's bad when most of second half was played like a reserved team as a whole. 

I suspect it has something to do with coaching. Players looked like they're not really confident enough to press ahead. Why not? 

How can he be blamed?!

Secondly, let see how he fares when he actually plays with our A team. It's quite odd why he was not tried in this second match in first half with different combination ahead of the barca match this weekend. I would not doubt his ability and positive influence if he's put to good use and is match fit

1304~~~
My thought exactly. If these's anything wrong with him, I would sort out how the coaching staff can help him integrate and be fit for matches.

1305~~~
He does look heavy, to be fair. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets put on a fitness program for a few weeks/months before LvG starts playing him from the start of matches.

1306~~~
Are you, like, looking for something to take offence at or something? Sweet Jesus, he commented yer man had a fat arse. So what? He does. It's just an observation. Move on. 

Ugh, why am I even replying to this tripe

1307~~~
SELL HIM! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> 

<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #ffffff">They're already creeping out of the woodwork. </span></span>

1308~~~
I'd rather have this sort of preseason, with a few shit performances, players huffing and puffing....then bang! Hit the ground running at the start of the EPL.

Last year it felt different. We cruised through preseason, players looked good, but we really struggled in the EPL. I know, a ton of the feel good factor had to do with Moyes being gone as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But yeah, rather pick up on the form/fitness/tactical issues now, then later. As amol said, Tis exactly what preseason is for.

1309~~~
Correct me if I am wrong, in the past, preseason was just preseason. It's a warm up and has not a lot to do with the proper season because players mostly came back from holiday with tans and the oppositions were almost always not strong competitors but we almost always won (even the oppositions were all match fit as they were in middle of their season. It was how strong United were. Preseason US tour was a chance to gain some fitness and getting to use the American top facilities, socialising, meeting American fans, doing some advertising dirties and charities. Then when they are back home, it's business as usual to win games week in and week out. 

I have been to those games before. Players were playing so freely and enjoying themselves. (We won against Celtic btw) 

Nowadays, these preseason is like interviewing sessions, or auditioning, whereby players can look nervous at times.

1310~~~
You're wrong.

The only meaningful difference between this and previous pre-season tours is the fact that it's shorter. 

For the record, we've frequently been beaten on pre-season tours in the past.

1311~~~
And that's okay! Winning in preseason was not important. We've won when it mattered.

1312~~~
People keep reading too much into results in pre-season. Fitness is what matters. A good start to the season is what matters the most.

1313~~~
Sort of like Chelsea last year they were pretty shite in pre season

1314~~~
Was good last night. The only player not giving the ball away. No idea what you lot are on about.

Not sure how anyone can criticise him? Just did the right thing every time he had the ball. All about fitness in pre season. People need to stop reading so much into every touch each player has in meaningless games.

1315~~~
He doesn't just look fat to me, he also looks old. Disturbing.

1316~~~
Yeah! Let's try and experiment, get fit etc during pre season! But when the EPL starts....hit the ground running

1317~~~
There is nothing to worry about. He started training last Tuesday.

1318~~~
Of course not but the Caf really likes to moan and act like a bunch of teenage drama queens

1319~~~
he gave it away plenty

1320~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/too-early-to-be-getting-worried.405538/page-20#post-17759713">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/too-early-to-be-getting-worried.405538/page-20#post-17759713</a>

Kept saying this in the "Too early to be getting worried?" thread.  I'm not convinced of the wisdom of buying a player who has achieved everything possible at a club where he is a legend, then coming here at 30 years of age for a "new challenge".  Can't question his ability, but will the motivation to succeed in a tough league like the EPL be there knowing he has a loving home he can go back to at anytime.

1321~~~
I know! Some people in this place are mad.

I just got back from a one week, all-inclusive holiday. I went for an 8k run today and did an average of 6.20 per kilometre, a whole minute and 10 seconds slower than my usual. For those of you that don't know, that's slow as shit compared to my normal time. But feck it, I had one week off and now I'm finished, might as well never run again. Caf logic.

1322~~~
He's played ninety minutes of pre-season football and people are already worried? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1323~~~
Yep...people need to give him some time.

1324~~~
What a show off! :"Woo look at me, I afford myself all-inclusive holidays and can run 8k". That's disgraceful sir, disgraceful. <span style="color: #ffffff">sorry</span>

1325~~~
Interesting to see whether he will be preferred to Carrick, whether Carrick will be used in defence at all (assuming we don't sign another CB) and whether it will be one match per week for them both.

1326~~~
Unfortunately, non of those things are anywhere near as exciting as they sound! And all-inclusive's are very bad for your waistline.

1327~~~
It was obviously tongue in cheek.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1328~~~
I know <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>, no one would be impressed by a 50 minute 8k run!

1329~~~
I'd expect Schweinsteiger to generally get the nod if LVG's only going with one of them and both are fit, but I'd still imagine that the two of them will both get plenty of playing time anyway.

1330~~~
I don't get why people are so harsh! LvG was harsh by saying he's "bad" (sometimes I think it's LvG's language skill and his struggle for better expression that had made him sound so critical but I can't say for sure). It's preseason and he had so few training to get match fit. World class players don't turn mediocre overnight. I have full confidence he will do well to get to his best once season starts.

1331~~~
Have a bad feeling that he's doing a toure. The class is still there but because of his downturn in physicality he just won't be the same player. I get that he hasn't been here long enough to be at peak fitness but even last season he wasn't impressive. Add that to the fact that he's been injury prone he could turn into a pretty expensive mistake.

1332~~~
No sign of him training today. Injured?

1333~~~
LVG can be a bit thick! there was absolutly no need to be so bleeding honest after the match, it is why some players don't get alone with him as a manager.

1334~~~
Schweinsteiger does not have any problems with that... 

He survived Gerland and Magath... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1335~~~
Well worrying won't make his body any younger, people.

1336~~~
He's just a young Alex Ferguson from 1983.

1337~~~
Unlike Toure and the incompetent city management, we wont be sticking him in a midfield 2 and expecting him to do all the donkey work along with creation. He's going to be managed correctly.

1338~~~
Hardly that expensive. Plus the fact that we also signed Schneiderlin means we're well covered in any case. Even if Schweinsteiger contributes nothing our Carrick/Schneiderlin/Herrera/Blind selection in midfield is better than what we've had for the last few years.

1339~~~
What did he say?

1340~~~
That Bastian played bad.

1341~~~
Are you always so God damn negative? Every single thread I see your post in its negative!

1342~~~
And why 90% of them enjoy his style of management.

1343~~~
Most players who have played for him love his management style. Honesty is usually best, if you are a man you can take it, if not you're a little bitch and not the type of player he wants in his sqaud anyway.

Interestingly Mou also has the same sort of style

1344~~~
He still shouldn't have said it, didn't LvG say he doesn't like to single out players? because it's a team game etc?
When saying: He thought we were poor in the second half, and a journo asked him if that also included Bastian, he should have stuck to his principals and downplayed the individuality of it.
He does like to contradict himself at times.

1345~~~
Talk about story emerging from absolutely nothing. 
Look at the exact quote before starting to criticise.

1346~~~
You mean like watching his whole press conference on Mutv or?
He's always going on about team performances, how he refuses to talk about individuals either in a positive or negative light, then takes the time to talk about Bastian (due to the press) and then speficially excludes Pereira's perfromance from the 2nd half criticsim of the team.
huh? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> stick with the program LvG?

1347~~~
He's spoken about individual players plenty of times in the past season. It's not some law he's written on his bedroom wall.

1348~~~
Usually when he speaks about players after the game, it's in a positive light after Stewart Gardner starts with "I know you don't like to talk about individuals but.. player x.." by which point he'll say a few good words about the performance.
He doesn't like to talk about individual performances usually, ala when a tabloid reporter in press conference would single out a player for praise he's been known to say akin; "Yes because X, Y & Z....  -but I thought there were 2 with better performances today" giving his opinion, then withholding who those 2 actually were.

He picks and chooses when he follows his principles aka <i>his philosophy</i> that he attests to adhere to so stictly.

1349~~~
But actually I thought that he even did it to save him as he already gave the explanation for it.
That he was bad - but that this was to be expected due to his lack of training.

When I see some comments here the second part of my last sentence just did not reach all recipients. Bastian always was a slow starter - now he even has some days less training than the rest and maybe has eaten the ice cream too much during his holidays - and he had long holidays this time. In my eyes that is nothing to worry about. He probably will do a lot of individual work now, too.

That he is not up to the physicality of the EPL... - that worries I cannot understand. The Bundesliga in the recent years has developed into the league of a lot pressing and fast counter attacks. But - even if he will cover probably the highest distance in the team (he did at Bayern when Müller is not in a free role) he never was the guy for the sprints and speed.

1350~~~
He didn't single him out really, he said he was also bad like everyone else, and that the only good thing was Pereira's goal. That's not really singling out IMO.

1351~~~
Is he still missing training?

1352~~~
Why has he been missing training?

1353~~~
Nobody could pick him out either in the training photos or the video or MUTV's inside the tour.

1354~~~
Nothing official. Should have probably asked if he's still not being seen in training pics and videos as he was not seen yesterday.

1355~~~
My thought exactly!

1356~~~
It's one thing to be honest inside the dressing room, it's quite another when there is absolutely no need to feed the media with headlines that create stirs. Yeah, you can be man enough to take criticism but they are not robots. A little respect goes a long way from the manager it is called courtesy. Unless it was a huge mistake made on the pitch and you can't escape addressing it when confronted by journos, a bit of discretion and diplomatic talk won't harm things. In fact, if your theory is right there won't be many players around for use.

1357~~~

1358~~~
In 1983 SAF was 42. How old is LvG in 2015? 63. What's your point?

1359~~~
Schweinsteiger isn't a teenager to get upset by the manager critiscizing him. Whereas praising pereira will probably improve his confidence as he is just coming through to the football world a small praise can do wonders.

1360~~~
Injured already. Took less then two weeks. feck me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1361~~~
A little knock, hopefully not to bad.

LVG > ''Its a minor issue, i dont want to take risks

1362~~~
Slight knock. No need to risk in a friendly game.

1363~~~
We won't be laughing if Michael gets injured tomorrow.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1364~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zs5plBqZC_k?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Anyone ever seen this one before? I never saw it before today. Bastian is such a nice guy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1365~~~
Jones at it again <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1366~~~
Hopefully people will now see why I was so desperate for us to sign Morgan. We basically have insurance against the (inevitable) injuries to Carrick and Basti.

1367~~~
Is that him on the right with his left knee in a small wrap? Could be he jarred his knee or something. At least it's not the ankle anyway which was the main thing bothering him the last few years.

1368~~~

1369~~~
No need to risk anyone. We want to be ready and fit for the game in 2 weeks time not tomorrow.

1370~~~
ahh so hes ok then. perfect

1371~~~
This.

1372~~~
But but what about the curse??

1373~~~
I don't want Smalling to get hurt.

1374~~~
Hoping this will not be like last season where all these "little injuries" would keep players out for a month or two

1375~~~
...and so it begins.....

1376~~~
... the group of moaning fecktardious redcafe scientists have pulled a roll of toiletpaper from under their beds and started crossing off the number of days he is injured so they might be able to prepare a 'called it' post 2 months into the new season.

Yes it has begun.

1377~~~
You might just be able to see it if you are in Germany. Little interview with Schweinsteiger in Germany. 

The injury is not even an injury. He just remarked a muscle in the match against San Jose and decided not to risk anything and go on with training.

1378~~~
Sensible to not risk it then.

1379~~~
Ballack in '02 was magic, the bastard.

1380~~~
But, but ............ WE NEED UNNECESSARY OUTRAGE!

1381~~~
Yes, then outrage yourself about the fact that they do not seem to have to sing a song or do something else after their first match for United... (he was asked for that in the interview, too)

1382~~~
We're cursed!!!

1383~~~
Oh, of all the videos I posted... I forgot this one (after Argentina in WC 2010) 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0N9ktcIft0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1384~~~
The initiation songs will come for the newbies. Remember Kagawa doing Gangnam style?!

1385~~~
Pure class.

1386~~~
He was really good in the first half.

1387~~~
Some of the one touch passes and long balls have been excellent but we're missing athleticism in midfield.. Don't think Carrick and Schweinstiger will work against teams that have quick players and play on the break.

1388~~~
poor in first 10 minutes but after that very good, Carrick Schweini combo looking nice <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1389~~~
He's so great. Not even doing anything out of this world either. Just a joy to watch.

1390~~~
Home games.

Away games Schneiderlin, Herrera and one of them needs to play.

1391~~~
Some slick and accurate passing from Basti but I don't like this combo with him and Carrick, it's too square. He looks fired up though which is great to see.

1392~~~
Just keep in mind that he is still behind with training sessions.

1393~~~
Thought he did really well. We just have to keep him fit, will be a great signing if so. People comparing him to Falcao are having a laugh, because Falcao lost a lot of his ability after his injury, while Schweinsteiger just lost a bit of his athleticism.

1394~~~
Can see his quality but needs something different next to him. Someone who can be a little more dynamic and run between the lines and attack the space rather than just passing it.....to easy to defend against

1395~~~
I want him to go forward more.

Both Carrick and him sit too deep. Probably instruction from LVG.

1396~~~
Him and Morgan will be better combo imo with Basti given more freedom to move forward.

1397~~~
I thought it was ideal at Bayern when he had Martinez as partner or behind him - Müller running the spaces - Ribery as a playmaker from the left and Robben doing his runs on the right. 

That was Heynckes - or more even van Gaal like.

1398~~~
So who to play him with?

1399~~~
playing 2 6s together is just LVGs way of being over cautious. he has to play with an 8. we have only one who is kind of an 8 and thats herrera.

1400~~~
Someone like Herrera you mean?

1401~~~
Same thought here. It is difficult to contribute to attack, when both central mids sit deep and are not really mobile. The Bastian+Cartick duo neither prevent PSG from slicing our defense, nor contribute much attack wise. We were outnumbered in central midfield and their final third, whereas our own defense was not protected much as both Carra and Basti did not press enough. Let's see how we line up against Spurs, but my prediction is that we wil not be able to play fast attacking game, if Anders does not start.

1402~~~
Schweini needs more training it seems to regain full fitness. I tend to agree that it should be either Carrick or Schweinseiter that starts, not both together

1403~~~
the lineup and tactics also need to change from game to game since the pressing tactics also change from team to team. PSG gave quite a bit of room in the middle of the park . enough for both mata and herrera to operate centrally with only one defensive 6 was required (schweinsteiger). its easy to say this in retrospect though.

1404~~~

1405~~~
Spot on. I get the feeling that LVG doesn't like him though....

1406~~~
Starting Bastian together with Carrick is like starting him with Alonso. Just not a good idea.

1407~~~
Played a few good long balls. Still needs to work on his fitness.

1408~~~
Didn't watch the game, but I was a bit confused by that selection when I saw the team sheets this morning. I think most people assume it will be an either/or scenario. Whoever's fit plays with Schneiderlin.

1409~~~
He played cause he was injured vs Barca and needed minutes.

1410~~~
I think it's potentially okay if you've got another more attack-minded player in front of them, or if you're aiming to keep possession, but yeah, I'd generally probably go for Schneiderlin alongside Schweinsteiger/Carrick, with Herrera possibly in front of them.

1411~~~
He's been shite so far.

No point dressing it up.

1412~~~
Well except he wasn't shite at all yesterday, was one of our better players in that first half along with Memphis and the fullbacks and generally did well while being short of fitness.

1413~~~
No he wasn't. He kept getting caught on the ball, dribbled past, and was generally well off the pace.

Played some nice long passes, which he's done all tour, which seems to have blinded people to the rest of his game.

1414~~~
Hasn't been great but it's only pre season. Can't be looking into things too much.

1415~~~
Same conundrum with Rooney and scoring goals over the last 3 seasons

1416~~~
Sloppy start but settled down and played well for the rest of the half.

1417~~~
Two players, both well past their peak.

1418~~~
Ah come on, he's barely played and is obviously still building his fitness.

Still, agree with those who say him and Carrick shouldn't play together. Carrick/Schweiny + Schneiderlin is a pretty nifty midfield though.

1419~~~
Except he hasn't atall. Class yesterday.

1420~~~
He was decent last game. So far he has only had one shite game.. yesterday he looked at the races.

1421~~~
Aye, it's very early to pass a full judgement on him. Obviously people are entitled to give their opinions on each performance and he hasn't set the world alight thus far, but I'm not too worried either since I'm expecting he'll take a wee while to settle fully.

1422~~~
Yep fully agree. Fletcher looked world class last pre season but then we know what happened as soon as the season started. While as you say it might take a while(Fergie always said the first few months were tricky for new players)I can't see Bastian being anything other than a success.

1423~~~
Not as convinced he'll be a superstar like everyone else is, but hope I'm wrong.

1424~~~
I don't think he'll be a superstar as such; he's getting on a bit in years, and is probably past his very best days. But I do think he'll be an incredibly useful player, and will hopefully still have some class that can add to our midfield. I'd be fairly happy with that.

1425~~~
I mean...its preseason. New club and new formation etc. I'm not too worried about Schweiny. The class will show through in my opinion. 

My concern is LVG right now in how he's completely ditched the 4-3-3 and Herrera which looked like it was going to be the foundation to build upon. And Blind as CB....jesus

1426~~~
He's better than Carrick. There, I said it.

Should play when fit, imho.

1427~~~
It's clear we can't over use him but I reckon he will be a great option for us. He has a calming presence and a touch of class, the only thing lacking is fitness but that will come. Having Schneiderlin, Carrick, Herrera, Fellaini and Blind as midfield options aswell really sets us up strong in that position.

1428~~~
His new profile picture on Facebook is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1429~~~
Wouldn't start him against Spurs. I'd bring him on later in the game, though.

1430~~~
I'm the same. Not sure his fitness levels would be good enough yet.

1431~~~
He's been given the number #31 apparently. A picture inside the United dressing room.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLV86CEW8AAji_F.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLV86CEW8AAji_F.jpg"/>

1432~~~
what about Fellaini? He had the 25 at Everton, and Valencia has it.

Edit: It is probably fake the pic, isnt it?

1433~~~
9? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Or maybe even on his way out?

1434~~~
not even played a competitive game yet and people are slating him.

welcome to redcafe!

1435~~~
Slating?

1436~~~
Would it be insane to suggest the 31 shirt would have anything to do with his 31st birthday being today?

1437~~~
Looks true. Bloke on twitter has posted a picture of himself next to it from a tour today. Said the guide mentioned the other numbers haven't been finalised yet.

1438~~~
His shirt for Bayern.

1439~~~
Was in Munich yesterday - and probably the day before. His brother who was on the microphone during the broadcast of the amateur derby told that he visited him yesterday to see his first nephew who was born Wednesday or Thursday.

1440~~~
Good to see our Schweinsteiger is a family man. I have no doubt he will be very useful for us, i expect him to nail down a spot soon if he stays injury free.

1441~~~
I think that's fairer to say, Bastian a world-class B2B, which means he has the complete package, while Carrick could only play the best as a 6

1442~~~
Nothing to worry about with his fitness though, right? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1443~~~
Did someone actually say that?

I was under the impression everyone thought he would need to be managed carefully and used fairly sparingly. Manager seems to be of the same opinion, otherwise why sign Schneiderlin?

1444~~~
I got a fair amount of abuse when I dared suggest that Schweinstiger was a high risk signing and that we needed to sign Schneiderlin as well. Too many people on here are blinded by big names, it seems.

Yeah, thankfully it seems that LVG isn't taking any risks with the midfield this season. Which makes a nice change for us United fans!

1445~~~
That's my impression too. Seems Sam's got a view on Basti though and he's desperate to make sure people know it.

His last 6 posts in this thread:

1446~~~
Am I not allowed to post if my view is not the same as others? I spent the first 6 months of last season saying Falcao was shite, and kept getting laughed at. 'How dare you, he's Radamel fecking Falcao?!'. Turns out I was right. 

Obviously, I'm not saying Basti will go the same way, but the risk is there. And so far, his performances haven't convinced me that my worries are unsubstantiated. Hopefully, in time, he'll put my worries at ease and show his quality. And if he does, I'll be the first to say so.

1447~~~
people, we have signed an insurance policy over any potential injuries to our midfield veterans. sit back and enjoy, it's all safe and sound

1448~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> There is only 1 use for this  - Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!  Wagering is not allowed in India, but if I could - I would bet my 1 months salary of BFS scoring more goals this season than Falcao last season.

1449~~~
I'm not entirely sure it is your opinion though, well, I think it is but this is a more hyperbolic version of it given you've also made these posts about him:



I think you've fallen into a trap we've all been guilty of where by arguing your point (in this case still needing to sign Morgan, which I agree with btw) you've had to do so by exaggerating your bashing of the player your argument is against.

Injury issues or not, Basti is still a world class midfield player and the sort of character we absolutely needed in our squad.

Just be happy <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1450~~~
If he gets fit and used to the PL soon; he will be world class for us I am sure. He can take our team to another level and in our squad currently the only one with di Maria and DDG (to a certain degree) leaving.

1451~~~
All those posts are in relation to his interviews/press conferences, where he has come across absolutely brilliantly. Very likable bloke, who says all the right things, and will certainly bring a lot of leadership and experience to a very young squad. Which is great.

But it doesn't take away my concerns about his fitness and ability to adapt to the PL at this stage of his career. I'm certainly happy with the singing though, he's a low risk luxury (who cost relatively little) and whose potential upside far outways any downside.

1452~~~
Sams just doing what he done with Falcao. Ripping into him from day 1.

1453~~~
First of all I'm not ripping into him at all. Second of all, seeing as I was bang on the money with Falcao, that's hardly something that can be used against me is it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1454~~~
Tbf you were by no means alone in that opinion. If anything, it was shared by the majority. Or close to it anyway.

1455~~~
Saying he was shite in all the friendlies then going on about injuries before he's even kicked a competitive ball for us yet is a bit much. I'd be happy with 20 games from him in the league this season. He's obviously class. Falcao was done after his ligaments went and never recovered from it. May aswell write every player off.

1456~~~
It is just pre season. I don't think there is anything to see here other than he needs to get in better shape. I definitely would not start him against the spurs though. I think it is best we bring him him gradually and not all at once.

1457~~~
Nothing new or that was not told before. He is off injury problems since October/November if you do not take a knock that gets him out for one match as big injury. What stole him the form for the recent weeks of last season was a bad flu that put him into bed 2 weeks and afterwards he had problems to get in form in time. 

If he stays off injuries - and there is a big chance for that as he seems to be out of that cycle he was in for two years - and gets in form he is just a 31-year-old-world-class-player - who does not need much rests. In my eyes he would not have moved if he would have still any problems with his old injuries. The problem with new injuries you have with every player of every age - despite that Bastian knows his body and knows when to take care and get a day out of training and work individually. 

Let him get fit and into form. 

But I actually do not want to read any complaint if he is the first player on the pitch with long sleeves, gloves, caps, scarves - I am sure he will be.

1458~~~
If you moan about everyone and everything you are bound to be right once in a while I suppose.

1459~~~
It's boring now.

1460~~~
I'm actually positive about a lot of things. Just this Summer I've been very vocal in my praise for our new signings Darmian, Memphis and Schneiderlin (and the prices we've paid), plus the potential Pedro signing (even when most are moaning about that one). I'm not even against the Basi signing, I just have some concerns, which I have said are now not that big as we have Morgan. I've actually said our midfield is the best in the league. I've been very open about how highly I rate Shaw and Smalling, and I've praised Young and Fellaini for the way they've turned their United careers around. I've also praised Woodward for the work he's done in the market, and how he's transformed his image since 2013.

But hey, people don't want to remember any of that.

1461~~~
You can see where Sam's coming from with his concern about Schweini's fitness but the fact of the matter is he'll be managed carefully and used sparingly, meaning he'll hopefully be extremely effective.

1462~~~
Schweinsteiger should not be used sparingly. We need to get him fit and then the team should be built around him. It's years since we had a midfielder of his ability in the squad. We should use it.

1463~~~
Worst case scenario is he is a very good back up for Carrick which we didn't have last season and a big reason we struggled last season. He's a better player then Carrick though once he gets fit though so I think he'll be a very good player for us.

1464~~~
He's one of the few play making midfielders who can run with the ball at his feet. I think he will be deployed in a more advanced role than Carrick to be honest. He needs to get fitter to run more.

1465~~~
Not surprised at the Guardialo comments on Schweinsteiger. It was obvious if you looked at his injury record of the last few seasons. Clubs like Bayern usually don't sell their top players in prime shape.

Still hopeful that he can play a part in this period of transition (Ya, another one). Schweini can still offer us a lot if he was managed in a way that Fergie utilized Rio during the later years.

1466~~~
He doesnt like the cold? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1467~~~
Schweingreaves !

1468~~~
No you didn't get abuse.

Go look on the Schneiderlin vs Schweinsteiger thread. More people here wanted Schneiderlin. So I don't know where you got too many people on here are blinded by big names from.

1469~~~
Not encouraging words from Pep .And with the clubs record on injuries .Doesn't bold well.

1470~~~
It's not like RvP had a great injury record, yet he played a full season injury free for us when he signed.

1471~~~
not at all

And I dont see the point in signing a player no matter how good they are if they can only be fit to play in 50% of the games

I said it long before we signed him and got a lot of grief. There is a reason why Bayern let him go so easily and replaced him with Vidal

1472~~~
They offered him a new contract and wanted him to stay to be fair. They wouldn't have done that if they had serious doubts over his fitness. Might just be a manager trying to justify why they lost a homegrown fan favourite.

1473~~~
But he had just come off an injury free season so was worth the risk. Schweiny has played less than 50% of Bayerns league games for the past two season (3 out of the last 4)

1474~~~
Same way as we offered great servants like Nicky Butt and P Neville contracts but left the door open for them too

1475~~~
Pep hasn't said anything we didn't already know.

Our ever reliable medical team passed him his medical so we must trust he'll stay fit.

1476~~~
In terms of gambling on injury riddled players, I think RvP was the more risky transfer. Morgan make us less reliant on Bastian, who I only see as rotation material with Carrick. Besides, it's not like we weren't aware of the situation with Bastian before we signed him, the staff obviously have some sort of plan for him.

1477~~~
My sentiment exactly. If he happens to get injured, it's not because we bought damaged goods, it's because we've either been unlucky (out of control) or stupid (in control) with his training.

1478~~~
I remember arguing with a couple of posters in his transfer thread who were adamant that Schweinsteiger didn't have fitness problems. I thought it was one of those internet arguments that would be quickly ended just by posting the facts about his appearance record but they were not to be swayed.

1479~~~
Schweinsteiger is a gamble 100% worth taking, we've lost plenty of experience and we need him on and off the pitch.

As far as i'm concerned he's fit now and if we could get 30 games out of him then great.

1480~~~
He was fit to play in more than 50% of games last season and that was the season immediately after running himself into the ground for Germany in the WC. He's had a decent break this summer, which should make a big difference.

1481~~~
20 out of 34 league games

Im not sure how many of these were starts

1482~~~
He wasn't injured in all those games he didn't feature.

1483~~~
I looked it up he started 15

I suppose if we do use him sparingly it will be OK? 

But its a concern

1484~~~
That's what I'm hoping.

Would have been a major concern if we hadn't signed Schneiderlin but adding the latter player to our squad means we've the luxury of using BFS a bit like Fergie used Giggs in his latter years.

Of course it remains to be seen what Van Gaal's plans are. Will be interesting to find out.

1485~~~

1486~~~
*sigh*

In those 30 years of coaching, Neururer had close to 20 jobs as a coach, most of them in the 2nd Bundesliga or sometimes at clubs fighting relegation in the Bundesliga. Only once did he stay at a club for more than 2 years. He loves to talk big and loud, but really has no fecking clue what he's talking about. That's why his biggest achievement as a coach in those 30 years is to qualify for the UEFA Cup playoffs once, which he followed up by failing to reach the group stages and getting relegated in the next season. Which ended his longest spell at a club, 3 and a half seasons.

That was 10 years ago and he kinda vanished back then. I'm still not sure what happened that he all of a sudden gets time on tv shows again now. It's mind-boggling that his opinion seems to be interesting to football fans in Germany. But I guess hating on Guardiola is pretty cool at the moment, so why not join in.

1487~~~
Oh. It seems that this guy is just trying to be melodramatic by speaking against sale of Bastian to here. Regardless of his saying, could it be possible Guardiola and Beckenbaur are suggesting he has not been able to over come his injury problems past three years to persuade the fans into believing the decision to sell was right? 

I know no player is above a club, but he was an icon there and played quite few times at Bayern last season where he was really good even though he missed first few months due to injuries. Its also not as if Bayern has a complete injury free seasons as well, RIbery hasn't been fit for last two years on a consistent basis, Robben was injured a lot this season, Badstuber is rarely fit, even Lahm have had setbacks for past two seasons, Alcantara has a stop-start injury history, Martinez the same. Alaba had a long lay-off as well. Bastian, for me, seemed to be almost as fit as these other players last few years.

1488~~~
They protest too much. The player wanted to come to England. I think they're out of order questioning his fitness.

1489~~~
People overthink the whole thing and look for a deeper meaning to accuse someone of something. There's nothing right about selling a club legend just because he had a few injuries. No one wanted Schweinsteiger to leave, that's the simple truth. He had a fair contract offer and could have retired at the club if he wanted to. He started almost all games under Guardiola when he was fit enough to start. But he simply wanted to leave and fullfil his dream of playing in England towards the end of his career. We respected that, that's it.

What's so difficult about accepting that he simply wanted a different challenge for a few years? I really don't get that. I went abroad for 3 years in my job and it was a fecking awesome experience, even though it was a difficult decision regarding my life in Germany back then. If I was a pro footballer, I sure as hell would take the opportunity to go abroad, no matter how much I love my boyhood club. It was a respectful decision between club and player, yet all summer long we have to read some nonsensical psychological crap from outsiders who've either done the same (Beckenbauer was only 31 when he left Bayern for New York and then came back and played for fecking Hamburg in the Bundesliga) or have changed clubs all their lives all the time and burned bridges with their clubs by being disrectful cnuts (Matthäus, Effenberg). It's ridiculous.

Oh yeah, and now Peter Neururer shares his insights into the topic. Of course he knows all about how to deal with superstar players at a European top club, just like he knows all about loyality and staying all his career at one club.

1490~~~
My point was something along the line of 
It's the questioning of fitness which is just making it sound like he's crock who the club was happy to get rid of. Your post says that is not true which I think is fair.

1491~~~
You are out of order. They are out of order. This whole THREAD is out of order.

1492~~~
"...how much did you say they're paying you?!"

1493~~~
Any word if he's expected to be fit to start?

1494~~~
I've got nothing to input other than that cnut is so annoying on Twitter that I was forced to either block him or kill myself.

On topic - I love BFS <3

1495~~~
Will probably come off the bench today, which i think is great, considering that he isnt fully fit (van Gaal's definition). Cant wait to see him in the PL <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1496~~~
@sbates_people: Unconfirmed but chatter in #MUFC  camp this morning is Bastian Schweinsteiger could be a surprise starter

1497~~~
would be a real surprise...but cant see it. Schneidelrin and Carrick are fitter, unless someone is injured

1498~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1499~~~
Bastian feckING Schweinsteiger

1500~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1501~~~
He's going to get an almighty reception, isn't he

1502~~~
Oh yes, should be awesome. Does he have a song yet?

1503~~~
I'd love it to see him start, but think it'll be Carrick and Morgan.

1504~~~
Steve Bates is often bang on with team news but I too would be very surprised to see it.

1505~~~
officially confirmed talking crap. Bates has lost  the accuracy since the winter transfer

1506~~~
Love him already. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1507~~~
Scholes-esque passing. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1508~~~
Stay fit please....

1509~~~
So surreal. Quick passing we haven't seen since Scholes.

1510~~~
Good cameo I thought. Shame everyone else went to shit and couldn't run anymore.

1511~~~
A decent debut, always in the right place & good passing. Will only get better.

1512~~~
That one Long ball to Rooney was absolute worldclass. Hope he stays fit.

1513~~~
Our best phase of play came right after he came on. Looking forward to seeing him when we play better and he's fully fit and settled.

1514~~~
He seems like he needs fitness, he wasn't as sharp as I'd have expected.

1515~~~
Needs to get fitter but was an above average performance. Continued our control on the midfield and looks to pass it quick and pass it forward which is great.

1516~~~
Tremendous.

The thing that impressed me most was that he was happy to come and get the ball even with a couple of players around him, knock it aside and then have it back again. As the BT Sport commentators said, it was like watching the conductor of the orchestra. He makes a massive difference to how we bring the ball out from the back, and hopefully he will get himself fit enough to start alongside one of Schneiderlin and Carrick, who looked solid defensively but perhaps lacked the composure to go and get the ball under pressure.

1517~~~
The general.

1518~~~
I thought he looked good, his passing was sublime, he doesn't need anytime on the ball, reminded me of scholes.

I hope he starts the next game.

1519~~~
He was solid. Looks a little slow but still covers a lot of ground. Always knows where to be, and very vocal for a debutant. But it's no ordinary debutant. It's Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

1520~~~
Showed he was in a different league when he came on, weird decision for the yellow card but other than that he didn't put a step wrong. I get the feeling he could boss our midfield for the next 4 years.

1521~~~
It was quite funny seeing this old slightly unfit bloke come on and boss everyone around. But we seemed to spend the rest of the game getting battered by Spurs so I'm not sure if it was coincidence or I should be worried. 

Carrick always looks at his best when he's not on the field for some reason.

1522~~~
I loved that. We need those leadership qualities. Will be better once he gets his fitness up. Sure we didn't buy him to play 90 mins every week, but we do need a personality like him in the dressing room.

1523~~~
No doubt he'll get sharper and fitter but he'd still be an improvement on things even if he was to stay the way he was there today. 

We stepped it up a gear once he came on, his presence in midfield and his vision or desire to play the forward pass only was clear for all to see.

1524~~~
Surreal seeing him play for us. Going to be a great player for us. His passing ability probably only rivalled by Carrick/Scholes in the last 15-20 years of midfielders that have played for us.

1525~~~
And yet we spent the last 15 minutes under the cosh. Edit: To be fair this was more to do with Valencia coming on...

1526~~~
Just needs to stay fit. He looked far more willing to go forward than I imagined he would.

1527~~~
Love this guy, proper leader that we have been missing in the middle of the park.

1528~~~
Good run out for him, used the ball well and added extra presence in the center, it'll take time but I expect him and Carrick to be splitting games like this most of the season, obviously reversing today's roles at times.

1529~~~
Did well today. The yellow was a bit of revenge. That dirty bastard Chalki had a little dig at him off the ball a minute or two before and behind the ref's back.

1530~~~
Bavarian internet fans never fully recognised his talent. Good to see that he will be appreciated.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1531~~~
I absolutely love his platinum blonde hair.

1532~~~
Looked great until we collapsed into a cramped shell. 

When you park the bus you don't need Schweiny or Herrera, 10 Milners would be best.

1533~~~
Will be amazing if we can get him properly up and running in a month or so.

1534~~~
Glad he got 30 minutes today. still a bit off but his fitness will should only get better.

Agreed that van gaal needs to manage him just like fergei used to with rio in his later years.

1535~~~
He brought great leadership to the midfield by guiding everyone around him as to what to do. Clearly lacks sharpness and match fitness for the PL at the moment. I dont expect him to play a full 90 minutes for the next few weeks.

1536~~~
Loved how he immediately started dictating play and pointing to players. He's still not fit. Needs at least 3-4 games under his belt to get in optimal physical condition.

1537~~~
Thought it was hilarious how he'd have the ball at his feet whilst actually pointing at people and telling them wear to run, so that he could pass into that space... and no one would argue with him... because you know, he's Bastian Schweinsteiger.

1538~~~
He's a born leader and can still offer a lot to the team in the same way players like Scholes and Robson did in the twilight of their careers

1539~~~
I still can't believe he plays for us! 
I can't wait until he's fit , immense player.

1540~~~
He should be captain. You can't have someone conducting the orchestra like he does yet give the captaincy to someone playing the triangle in the back row.

1541~~~
On the contrary; before there was solid speculation he was leaving, they hailed him as one of their best players and most certainly did not want to see him leave. Once the rumours started to become concrete, it's quite funny how much of them changed their tune. Two of my friends who are avid bayern fans, went from hailing him as in the top 5 midfielders of this generation and insisting he still has a lot to offer, to now brushing him off as injury prone, past it and not worth such a big salary.

1542~~~
Nice cameo. Played like he gas been with us for ages.

1543~~~
Looked a lot sharper then pre-season, and liked the way he started controlling the team straight away, but he did still got caught behind the pace of the game a few times.

Aldo kept getting him confused with Shaw. One of them is going to have to have a haircut.

1544~~~
Bale aside he was my ultimate muppet signing at the start of the transfer window, way more than Ramos, Alves, Gundogan etc, to see him in a United shirt and look as happy as he does to be here is a fantastic thing, really hope he can stay fit and give us a great three years.

1545~~~
Loved all the pointing and controlling midfield as soon as he came on.
Class player hope he gets loads of playing time.

1546~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1547~~~
Dont want to spoil the party but did feck all when he came on. Early days though.

1548~~~
I thought he was anonymous but it's early days I guess.

1549~~~

1550~~~
The reception he got when he came on was insane. He must have been buzzing. He instantly started to boss the players as well, telling people where to position themselves and things off the ball, a real leader.

1551~~~
He begun to train mid july, so obviously he isn't ready.

1552~~~
He is a smart buy. Keeps the ball well and if he stays fit could start to boss it.

1553~~~
I like how he was always pointing out he was free for a pass and always looking for the ball.Reminded me of Scholes in that regard.

1554~~~
I must admit I got excited watching him play today. I know it was only 30 minutes but he looks a different class to what we have in the team at the minute. His control of the ball and the way he brings other players into the game was brilliant to watch. Must admit needs a bit more fitness but I think Bayern were wrong to let him go.

1555~~~
I really wanted him to have a shot. Don't even care if it went in. I'd have celebrated it like it did.

1556~~~

1557~~~
I think anyone expecting 'a best midfielder in the world ' type with him will be disappointed for the majority of the season. However what I am expecting from him is Henrik Larsson like effect here..to provide leadership to the young players, show the class we know he has even if the legs may not be as efficient as they used to be..and also a winning spirit again back in this team.. So I think expectations will be determine how people will measure his success here.

1558~~~
Felt bad for Carrick, rarely taken off at 60 minutes and the appreciation goes to the new signing,felt kind of fickle to me.

I thought Schweinsteiger was well off the pace, he pointed a lot, but also made a few sloppy passes.

1559~~~
Thats going to happen a lot this season I think, and vice versa.

1560~~~
What a man

1561~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anmZ2x20ExI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1562~~~
I would feel good for him, he should be managed to be fresh all the time at this age. and surely someone like him has been there and done that a feck load of times to not care about it

1563~~~
Once he's fit he'll have to start every game. Thought he had the game undercontrol when he came on.

1564~~~
Commentators pointed out how vocal he was when he came on. That can only be a good thing

1565~~~
I really don't understand all the praise for him here. What did he offer when he came on that Carrick didn't do? I hear people saying we became more solid, but I honestly thought we started to cave in and play as if only 30 seconds remained.

Could of course have more to do with general fitness, and Valencia coming on, but still.

1566~~~
We were worse after he came on. If he wants to be a team player he needs to cut out the pointing shit.

1567~~~
why? he actually needs to do that, showing teammates where the ball should be played? it's a duty the coach also delegates to Carrick, clearly possible to see when he plays, actions these players are capable of

1568~~~
Yeah nothing wrong with pointing to where he thinks the pass should be made. Especially when players receive the ball under pressure it can help.

1569~~~
He's 34 now... People seem to forget that.

1570~~~
What? 

Roy Keane one of our best ever players used to do that.

1571~~~
Schweinsteigers performances has lead to some of the most polarising opinions on RedCafe.

1572~~~
I'd like to see him start the next game. Hope he's first choice. Drop one of Schneiderlin or Carrick.

1573~~~
It would have to be Carrick.

Because playing a midfield two of Basti and Carrick would be a disaster waiting to happen.

1574~~~
Thought he was alright when he came on. People shouldn't expect miracles when he too is a new player who needs to gel with his new teammates and adapt to a new league.

1575~~~
Cut out telling people what to do? I hope not, because he knows better then anyone how and where to play and pass it. He's a leader type on the pitch and he showed it. He just needs to get his fitness up. And we looked better for the first 15 minutes he was on, controlling the game a lot more, and then we fell off as Darmian and Memphis came off and we sat back to hold the lead. Schweinsteiger himself didn't do badly at all.

1576~~~
Also, one thing that he'll be an immense improvement compared to our other midfielders, is his first time and forward passing. Nobody else in our midfield is really great at passing it forward quickly into the forwards, or trusts them enough to play the ball to them under pressure. Schweinsteiger will just help control games a lot more and is a lot more creative in his passing then the others.

1577~~~
I think he's joking. He has to be joking. Yeah, he's joking. 



Right?

1578~~~
I think he'll be a lot better going forward, then he will be defensively (where he might struggle with the pace and intensity of the PL)

He'll also be a massive boost in Europe.

1579~~~
I don't think he'll have too many issues defensively or with the pace of the league, but Carrick's obviously better defensively speaking so we won't see Schweinsteiger play as the main defensive mid probably. Partnering Schweinsteiger with Schneiderlin to take care of the defensive side, and alongside Herrera I think is just our best option though. Once Schweinsteiger gets back to fitness I think he'll be right up there as the best midfielder in the league, if he stays fit of course. A great problem to have in terms of player selection though, no matter the combination we pick in midfield, I don't think I'll be that annoyed at our midfield 2 or 3. They're all top players and all 4 are better then any midfielder in the league bar Matic/Fabregas. Quite a change from the Fletcher/Cleverley duo we saw a year ago.

1580~~~
I thought he was pretty average to be honest. He didn't stand out to me or anything. Not saying he was bad, just don't understand all the praise he is getting.

1581~~~
Probably right.

My point was that he's in his 10th year, being subbed off at 60mins, a rare situation for him and people are chanting for another clubs legend. It seemed fickle to me.

1582~~~
Nothing special from Schwrinsteiger in his cameo, as some of the passes were sloppy and it was quite obvious he is not really match fit yet.

1583~~~
He did OK, a few nice passes, a few mistakes, clearly needs match fitness. The yellow card was a bit meh

1584~~~
If you play him infront of defense in the 4-1-4-1 we played last season he would absolutely boss it.

1585~~~
Indeed. Even Scholes, his last 'full' season where he was playing 90 minutes week-in week-out was in 06-07 when he was 31/32. Playing 60 minutes or being rested for games is good for Carrick.

1586~~~
To become more of a team player he has to stop communicating with his teammates?

1587~~~
Just gonna leave this here <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1588~~~
Why do you think it would be a disaster?

1589~~~
Yes. 

He'll be the orchestrator.

1590~~~
The most pleasing thing about Basti when he came on, was how he was barking instructions at the other players.

A proper leader on the pitch, and a decent performance too given he didn't start.

1591~~~
Yesterday he showed glimpses of how he can control games...by no means was it a brilliant cameo but nevertheless you could see how he'll run that midfield of ours once fit.

1592~~~
Brilliant player but looked a little out of condition still. Think he will be a great signing though.

1593~~~
Neither are agile enough to cover the others deficiencies, and both want to be on the ball, dictating from deep. Which, in effect, would probably be too defensive and leave the attack sort of disjointed. It'd sort of be like the issue that Bayern had with Alonso and Schweinsteiger.

1594~~~
Leadership advice for Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger from 712. Not much more to add really.

1595~~~
What on earth is this post?

1596~~~
One of the worst posts I've read this weekend, and that's saying something.

1597~~~
That flick with the outside of his boot to spin the ball around the Spurs player and land at Shaw's feet is one of the best things I've seen on a football pitch in years.

1598~~~
If?

1599~~~
Yep. 

Especially those one touch passes/flicks with outside of his foot when he has player on his back, haven't seen anyone doing that in our team since Scholes, or Berbatov to some extent.

1600~~~
Getting to match fitness isn't really a worry in my opinion. The question mark is whether he can avoid injury for enough of the season to rack up 30-40 appearances and in turn have an influence on our season. 


I think it's fair to assume that he'll get up to match fitness and be able to get stuck in and run about for 90 minutes.

1601~~~
I think he will be an amazing signing. Finally we won't be completely falling apart if there's no Carrick.

I think we should go back to the 3 in midfield though as having two DM's sitting back might be too defensive

1602~~~
Well yeah, that's the point I was making EDIT: Or trying to make. Being fit overall requires the player to be available for the vast majority of games. Which I'm pretty confident he won't be.

1603~~~
I think we'll be able to manage both him and Carrick really well and get the best out of both of them. 60 for Carrick and 30 for BFS is a good start. I can see them being rotated nicely and it's an ideal situation.

1604~~~
They'll get quite easily overrun.

1605~~~
I don't think they would get overrun. If anything they would be too defensive as a pairing for most games.

1606~~~
He's fecking quality. Even when half fit and eased into his first game in a new league he oozes authority and composure. 

He will be immense this season if he stays fit. Absolutely immense.

1607~~~
Basically, we've got a crock or perhaps an impact player?

1608~~~
Schweini is pointing at you now and yelling <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1609~~~
Dunno really. But I tend to take a fairly straightforward view on these sorts of things: if a player has been doing the same thing for a few years, don't expect him to suddenly change when he arrives. For that, see also the nutters on here who still thought Torres would be worth a punt from Chelsea even when it was apparent he'd been a busted flush for a few years at that point.

1610~~~
In all honesty, I'm not sure what his injury records was at Bayern. I'll have a scan. But yeah, I do agree with you.

1611~~~
I've no idea whether he's going to be a crock or not but I don't think we will see him as an impact player. 

I think we know exactly what we are getting and are well aware that he needs to be managed which is fine because we are in a position where we can do just that. 

Last season we relied on Carrick and couldn't manage him and as a result we suffered when he wasn't available because we had nobody capable of screening the defence. 


This season we have Carrick or Bastian and if they're both injured or struggling with something we don't have to push it and can rest them. This should help them both get more games rather than less as sensible management will hopefully see them be more careful and less risks taken because we need them to play.

1612~~~

1613~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!

1614~~~
"Schweinsteiger has/had problems with his ankle. That is the story since 2 or 3 years. He had surgery in the summer break in 2013 after the Treble Season and because of that came late into the season 2013/14. But he still had problems during the whole season and they got him through the World Cup with pain killers.

After the World Cup Müller-Wohlfahrt ordered a bigger rest for him because of that - so it could really heal. That is why he did not start into the training again until mid or end of October.

Everything fine until somewhen in March when he got kicked badly in the Dortmund match - and had to be rested for a match or 2. But in addition to that he had a real bad flu that took two weeks."

Doesn't sound that bad really. Think people are overstating it a bit

Also other german posters like Sphaero have said they expect Schwein to get back to his best after a couple of months of getting his match fitness back. So it doesn't sound like just an impact player at all. If we are going to be rotating between him and Carrick throughout the season we should be fine in keeping them both fit and not overplayed. 

Last season turned into a disaster everytime Carrick got injured so its a big relief to have someone to step in now and dictate the game for us.

1615~~~
Torres was playing really poorly though. Schwein has been playing good for Bayern and if the long rest he got after the world cup to heal him properly has worked then I don't think we should worry too much. 

Torres and Schwein situations shouldn't even be mentioned together as its much more different imo

1616~~~
Still can't believe we have this beast of a player turning out for us.

1617~~~
It will be a long season ahead (hopefully) and introducing him slowly to the English games would be ideal IMHO. Plus, still have Carrick in the side  and having both him and S31 fit for the whole season would bring a lot of difference to that midfield. Plus Schneiderlin of course, which by the way just showed what the midfield is missing last season defensively (without Carrick).

1618~~~
He's not match fit.  I'll wait for a few more games to really judge his form.

1619~~~
What cutting out the same shite he does for Germany while winning the World Cup, and Bayern while winning the treble? I don't think so.

1620~~~
We got evidently better once he came on. Then later we sat back to hold on.

Agree.

1621~~~
I dont think we were any significantly better when he came on. He made a mistake also I guess.

1622~~~
I agree, that clown Modrić does that too all the time. You know that guy? 
If only he would cut that shit out he could be a decent player I guess.

1623~~~
It's the confidence in himself that someone like Scwiensteiger brings. The stage is perfect for him whereas it just consumes other players. Looks the perfect match.

1624~~~
I'm delighted to have him here but i'm surprised at the positivity around his performances so far. I think he's been pretty poor overall. There are mitigating factors for that but he doesn't look he'll be putting in a great 90 minute performance for a long while.

1625~~~
He hasnt been spcial but hasnt been poor either imo. 

He wants to take the team to Oktoberfest. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1626~~~
Van Gaal: "I will allow it only if Bastian buys the first round because that is my philosophy."

1627~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

"Bastian I will let you take only left handed midfielders and left defenders with you cause its my philosophy."

1628~~~
And then after a couple of beers;

"Looeyvagaals wed ahmee!"

1629~~~
He hugs Bastian, raises his beer mug and yells: "This year we shall go for it!"

1630~~~

1631~~~
So we lose another superstar due to burglary related problems, and now this!

1632~~~
He really wasn't, you just didn't see what he was doing.

Had an instant impact when he came on.

1633~~~
I think I did, I was at the ground and made a point of watching him for the majority of the game when he came on. An okay cameo at best, nothing to write home about yet. That will come in time though.

1634~~~
Funny isn't it? I was there too and thought his impact was obvious though clearly a bit ring .rusty

1635~~~
"A good feeling. There is a lot of power in the game. The fans expect us to always play forward. Sometimes almost too much." - Bastian

Indeed, stop f*cking yelling shoot everytime he gets the ball. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1636~~~
if these words are not uttered by Bastian the speaker would instantly be killed

1637~~~
I thought he made a very clear difference to the midfield. He added a tempo to our passing that neither Carrick nor Scheid offered. Unfortunately, Valencia's rustiness at rightback made the team seem weaker overall.

1638~~~
Yeah I was there as well and there was a noticeable improvement in our play when he came on.

1639~~~
Be careful, you'll soon be accused of having an agenda with views like that.

1640~~~
What a classy man. Is offering to replace the number 23 jersey with the number 31 for those who jumped the gun and bought their's before the official numbers were announced.

1641~~~
I hope he takes the squad to Oktoberfest.

Purely for the thought of Van Gaal being smashed and coming out with some absolute nonsense again, but this time in German lederhosen.

1642~~~
There's one taking place in Manchester this year, it could happen!!

1643~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inhLp3FQdZY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1644~~~
He's been sending and signing new jerseys for the people who purchased the wrong number (like Shaw).

Just feck off Schweinsteiger you lovable German bastard <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1645~~~
Are you joking? Classy man ffs. It's what they all do now...standard business and only saps like yourself fall for it. Classy man...I wish there was a sick smiley

1646~~~
I wish this commercial stuff wasn't apart of our football. It's not right how they take advantage of the weak minded

1647~~~
He's a leader. That's what we need in the midfield.

1648~~~
Looks like someone bought the Di Maria jersey <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> 

On a serious note, I am not falling for anything. I just think it's a nice gesture.

1649~~~
So you could technically buy a fake jersey with that number and then put a picture up on his facebook account? Hmmm. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1650~~~
Oh shit, I really hope we win the league with him as manager.

1651~~~
Ah sorry If that come across as rude! (Although I was very rude so its hard to take it otherwise...I'm jaded with modern footballers I guess haha).  But footballers these days are all about business...all this nice trading stuff is all PR in my opinion. Like Aguero trading in the 16 for 10 for City supporters. I doubt the players themselves lose anything

1652~~~
Got to be one of the first names on the sheet whenever he's fit, not ifs or buts.

1653~~~
Do you think he is better than Carrick?

1654~~~
Love Carrick but yes I'd have to say so.

1655~~~
Yes? Easily

1656~~~
Bit of a difference between Blind, Schneiderlin, and then Schweinsteiger isn't there? Schweinsteiger has pretty much always been on a different level to Carrick, it's not even debatable really. The other two are a level below Carrick though and I haven't seen anyone say they're better then Carrick really.

1657~~~
nah I can show you many posts which show otherwise, from 2014-15 Blind's performance thread to Morgan's transfer thread. I (along with other posters thankfully)clearly remember having to defend Carrick quite often from some names. well don't want to provoke the thread, as it should be mainly about Basti's performances anyway, so I delete my post above

1658~~~
Carrick is good at what he does but he's very limited. Bastian on the other hand is one of the best in his role.

1659~~~
Carrick has been one of my favourite players for the last decade, but Schweinsteiger (when fit) is another level entirely. No knock on Carrick, of course, but Schweinsteiger is unplayable when he's in the zone.

1660~~~

1661~~~
Anyone think he'll start against Villa?

1662~~~
I think he just might be. Not sure if Carrick was just tired or what but when Basti came on it was a world of difference in how we were playing. Cant wait till he is fit and adjusted to premier league. He will be a hit in the CL though

1663~~~
I think he will be a substitute friday and start Tuesday.

1664~~~
Yeah that is what I am thinking too.

1665~~~
No honest fan should ever underestimate the contribution of Michael Carrick. But Schweinsteiger at his best (and it remains to be seen if he'll reach that with us,) shades Carrick.

1666~~~
Yes.

1667~~~
Silly question. A fully fit Schweinsteiger is streets ahead of Carrick.

1668~~~
I guess it depends on which role were talking about, if it's a lone pivot position Carrick would probably nail it, when were talking about a box-to-box role Schweinsteiger would probably have it.

But to call it a silly question is really dumb, especially when Schweinsteiger isn't fit and we don't know how his performance level are atm.

1669~~~
Yep. We all know what Carrick can do, but how many people who blatantly say Schweinsteiger is better have actually watched him regularly for the last years? From what I've seen of him in the <i>United</i> shirt so far, he will have to do a lot better if he is to displace a fully fit and in-form Carrick.

1670~~~
Club 12 - a Bayern fan organization that combines a lot of the Bayern fan clubs and that organizes the choreographies and away tours wanted to make a "Thank you, Bastian" choreography tomorrow in the stadium but got it cancelled by the firedepartment because of the styrofoam used. Instead they will post or let the fans post things with the hashtag #dankebasti on twitter.

1671~~~
Do we think he'll  start tonight then?

1672~~~
C'mon fully fit of course he is better, thats no slight on Carrick but Bastian is on another level

1673~~~
Bastian &  carrick shouldn't be playing in the same position.  Look at how schneirdlin plays for france as a complete protector of the defence.  With a defence like blind and smalling being so agile,  we need someone like schneirdlin eventually to take over from carrick.

1674~~~
He'd start on Tuesday and it makes sense to start him then.

1675~~~
Excellent stuff from him today. Really dominated the midfield when he came on.

1676~~~
He's a wonderful man. Not even fully fit and his class shows through.

1677~~~
Absolutely brilliant cameo from him.

1678~~~
Great today. Calm and controlled.

1679~~~
Just a wonderful player.

1680~~~
Needs to start.

1681~~~
This was much closer to the unplayable Bastian. His touch was sharp, the energy level was there and he fights for every ball.

1682~~~
Very good tonight.

1683~~~
So composed and so clever at changing the tempo, hopefully he starts from now on.

1684~~~
Start him against Newcastle. Looked so comfortable when him and Ander came on.

1685~~~
What a player, we've needed this for so long.

Bossed the game when he came on. Love the man.

1686~~~
Being able to bring him on when Carrick gets tired is a BLESSING!

1687~~~
This.

Time to start him, me thinks. Even if he's lacking the fitness to play the full 90.

1688~~~
We strolled to that win with him on the pitch

1689~~~
You see it in every gesture: He is a leader. (For example: When he won a tackle today and let the ball to Luke Shaw and Shaw didn't play it quickly enough, Schweinsteiger yelled at him. I like that.)

When he came on today, we became a much better team. I bet that we see him in the starting eleven against Brugge and that he came off after 60 minutes.

1690~~~
He's definitely done enough to justify a start against Brugge. Edged out Carrick in that position despite being on the pitch for only half the time.

1691~~~
If we keep him fit he'll be like Scholes was in the twilight of his career except he can actually tackle and stuff.

1692~~~
Great tonight controlled the midfield.

1693~~~
I think he will take Carrick's place in the team. I don't think Carrick - Schneiderlin works very well.

1694~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ...or just quality depth but we should really take that as a blessing before Champions League matches. One of the keys to the successful seasons.

1695~~~
I love him.....that is all. 

Seriously though, his composure, leadership and class are something we could do with for a full game. Hope he can get there!

1696~~~
Brilliant when he came on. Get him in the team.

1697~~~
A master.

1698~~~
On today's performance he deserves to start ahead of Carrick.

1699~~~
Me too<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Needed someone to kick ass - it's good for the young players to be around him.

1700~~~
Great cameo imo.

1701~~~
Really good showing once he came on. He should replace Carrick if he's capable of playing 90 minutes.

1702~~~
Beast of a player, massive addition to the squad. He's almost there fitness wise too<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1703~~~
I hope he can get fit and stay fit, because he could be a truly phenomenal player for us. Beautiful vision, composure, strength; you name it and he has it. We'll need to watch his minutes, but color me impressed with this half-fit Schweini.

1704~~~
Very impressed with him tonight,long may it continue.

1705~~~
Good performance. Can't wait till he's fully dusted off his ring rust. Needs to stay fit.

1706~~~
He was immense when he came on. Nothing spectacular, just really composed and controlled the game. Before he came on we were a mess for the 15 minutes before and then we were strolling after he came on. I really hope he's fit enough to start games soon, he'll make a huge difference

1707~~~
We took complete control as soon as he stepped on to the pitch. 

This is what he was signed for. Class.

1708~~~
You just know he's going to bring a couple of MOTM performances in the big games.

1709~~~
I'm laughing at how good he is. He actually strolls through games and looks head and shoulders above when he comes on. He controls the pace of a game so well. Never looks rushed.

1710~~~
7m <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
what a fecking player, class above anyone else on the pitch and in our team in general.

1711~~~
Metronomic. 

There is no other way to put it.

1712~~~
Wow. Master at controlling the game and the tempo.

1713~~~
Class.

1714~~~
has to start.

1715~~~
Looked great today. Will only get better once he gets more fit. Clearly a class apart in midfield when he came on, the vision and technique he showed on multiple occasions sticking out. Hopefully he stays fit, as he will be an automatic starter and the best midfielder in the league when fit. Just needs to be managed properly.

1716~~~
Absolute quality. Calmness he brings on the pitch transmits to others around it.

1717~~~
Doesnt panic with the ball at his feet. Calm, composed. So happy we signed him

1718~~~
He really shows he came from a very technical team and was an important player when fit.

1719~~~
When him and Herrera came on we took control. That is the midfield we have wanted since the summer.

1720~~~
An absolute Rolls Royce of a player. He could well be our most important player this season.

1721~~~
"Such an old man", "completely past it", "going to constantly get injured" etc

Absolutely bossed it today. What a fecking player.

1722~~~
His awareness of whats going on around him and his calmness on the ball is lovely to watch. Another two or three games now and he should have the cobwebs fully shaken off, then the midfield department will be well sorted.

1723~~~
Should play instead of Carrick as soon as he's fit. Carrick is not doing too well and Schweini just brings something to our midfield that we miss

1724~~~
Just caught TalkSHITEs post commentary on the game. They said he looked as if he was an old man playing with kids and looked out of his depth, were they watching the same game?

1725~~~
Still cant believe he plays for us. 

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

1726~~~
I think they're on drugs.

1727~~~
Imperious. From the moment he came on the field he pretty much owned the pitch. The way he carries himself, he <i>does</i> have an aura. You can just tell Basti is someone who has literally won it all. He is not going to be afraid of being closed down or going into a 50/50. Whenever the ball went to him it was like a bit of pressure was relieved. The other players in the side must feel so good having him as an option.

1728~~~
Class. The perfect substitution for when he came on.

1729~~~
I love Basti. I am amazed we actually got him.

1730~~~
Sky Sports Germany thought he completely changed the game to our favor.

1731~~~
Good performance from Schweini, love his physicality, just pushes players away.

1732~~~
He's such a Rolls Royce of a player. One of classiest players in the premier league. Wish we had him 5 years ago.

1733~~~
He might actually be my second favourite ever player after Beckham.

1734~~~
Class.

1735~~~
Moment he stepped onto the pitch we regained control of the game. Last season in these sort of situations we ended up defending deeper and deeper, barely holding on to a lead.
Hope he starts against Bruge in place of Carrick.

1736~~~
I think he made a good difference in midfield when he came on. Wasn't a brilliant performance, but I like what I see. If he can stay fit I reckon he could be a game changer for us. We looked a little more threatening with him and Herrera on the pitch.

1737~~~
It's brilliant how he eases pressure by passing and then instantly positioning himself to receive it back. Also, he knows perfectly when to push ahead.

If only we had such a player during those CL finals.

1738~~~
I'm actually tempted to say he was our man of the match. When he came on he just controlled the game.

1739~~~
Controlled it effortlessly when he came on, don't see how anyone can see any negatives in him tonight.

1740~~~
He was immense I thought when he came on

1741~~~
Has made a difference each time he has come on. Hopefully he and Morgan start on Tuesday.

1742~~~
Well it is called TalkShite for a reason.

1743~~~

1744~~~
He was very good when he came on. He doesn't move like he's unfit but he does look like he's carrying a few pounds. Maybe it's just the shirt..

1745~~~
What a class player. It just feels comfortable whenever he receives the ball while we're under pressure. You just know he won't feck up. I hope he starts against Bruges.

1746~~~
Can't wait for him to start getting into the starting 11. So, so good.

1747~~~
He was just commanding today.

1748~~~
Like this picture on the BBC live updates page with him and Memphis at the end

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/Km8MVcr.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/Km8MVcr.png"/>

1749~~~
This guy is pure class. I am thinking that we can be champions because of him.

1750~~~
Well they talk about him all the time anyways, it's getting a bit OTT. Anyhow, he certainly had a positive impact and it stopped AV running at us all the time. It also helped that we had a 3-men midfield imo

1751~~~
I truly believe that he brings so much more to United and especially the dressing room. Great to have him

1752~~~
I literally just clicked on here to add that picture. If you'd never heard of Manchester United, who would you think is the captain from that pic?

1753~~~
He's an absolute class act.

1754~~~
He played also some brilliant balls. Just wanted to highlight the different agendas. I definitely agree more with Sky Sports Germany though

1755~~~
I can't tell the difference between him and Shaw. There's been numerous times i've been shocked at how fast he is

1756~~~
Well Rooney talking to Depay would look strange as Rooney was far worse than him today. Fair play to Schweinsteiger though. He is true captain material anyway.

1757~~~
This.

1758~~~
Rooney would look less out of place if he was wearing a strap on and plastic comedy tits, than he does with the arm band on when Schweinsteiger is on the pitch. Bastian Schweinsteiger is older, lacking match fitness and has had loads of injuries, yet he has no excuses. He goes out and lets you know who the man is. Because he is a world class player. You cant pick and choose when you're world class. Its always there in the way you carry yourself. Its offensive how bad Rooney played today. And I'm not even a negative poster. I never lost faith in Fellaini or Ashley Young. I'm a proper push over. But the way he's playing at the minute doesnt justify his place in the side.

1759~~~
Agreed.

1760~~~
Rooney take note: this is a leader.

1761~~~
Just reading this thread makes me miss him so much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. And that after a pretty great 5-0 win in the opening game tonight. I want him back.

1762~~~
He's basically our captain. His passing is exquisite.

1763~~~
He's exactly the player weve been missing in the middle of the park. not just his qualities as a footballer but what he brings mentally to the dressing room and around the squad.

1764~~~
*still pinching myself*

1765~~~
Agree. He should be our captain. He will win us the league.

1766~~~
Completely bossed the midfield when he came on, changed the game

1767~~~
Yeah, showed his class when he came on - confident composure on the ball

1768~~~
Loved one bit of play in the second half where it was a stray ball, he went sliding and kept it on and was pointing to Shaw to take it whilst still sliding. haha.

Just the type of leader we needed in the centre. Put him with Herrera and Morgan from the start and ill be so happy.

Still, havent said it for a while, but bastian fookin Schweinsteiger <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1769~~~
Also gave Mata a bollocking for the shite pass. Love the lad.

1770~~~
Talk about seeing the full picture in your head; this guy sees things well before they happen and you can see him start to move towards the right place and get there right in time.

With him on we finally started to see triangles forming with the other midfielders, and the full back and winger on his side. Incidentally this is one of my biggest annoyances with Carrick, he doesn't move forwards enough to support players around him and give them a progressive passing option.

1771~~~
I'd have no problem with him being made captain.

1772~~~
he might not wear the armband, but when he's on the pitch there's no doubt who the captain is.

1773~~~
Everything about the man just oozes class. His posture, touch, control, passing, movement. Makes it look so simple and effortless. Not a single unnecessary movement. Hope the lads are watching and listening carefully in training. Especially the captain.

1774~~~
Grabbing a game by its gonads 101

1775~~~
It's no surprise that we looked much better when he came on. He's absolute class. 

Play a midfield three of Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Herrera and I can't see us losing any midfield battle in this league.

1776~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1777~~~
I'm glad, we've been crying out for leaders - and he's as good as it gets in that department.

1778~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1779~~~
I'll buy his shirt. Wear it to work and if anyone complains tell them that anyone wearing that shirt has to try to live up to the guy. 

Maturity, thinking, communicating, skill, play to win.

Just love him.

1780~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger

1781~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1782~~~
Helped us out so much he really did. So experienced and oozes class.

1783~~~
Looked a lot better than against Spurs, pretty much controlled it, very happy with his impact I guess.

1784~~~
He was feckin majestic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

It's like the whole team knew who was the boss and he had that authoritative presence which meant everyone deferred to him on the ball and he orchestrated the play brilliantly. He has the technique and ball retention capabilities but also the ability to inject some much needed tempo with quick direct forward passes and the nifty one-twos, in addition to his occasional raking thirty yarders. Provided a fairly steely presence on the pitch on top of his leadership qualities too, just the complete package. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> The whole complexion of the game, or perhaps the midfield dynamics, changed with his sub - Herrera's sub helped significantly too - and it was just fantastic to see him strutting his stuff about. Not like I'm watching him for the first time but it's a completely different sensation seeing him in an United shirt.

You buggers were lucky to have him for that long.

1785~~~
I know, but it wasn't long enough.

1786~~~
Truly sublime today. Controlled the game.

1787~~~
He needs to play every second. It's as simple as that.

1788~~~
He was born here - and has learned the football in the club...

I hope he kicks his skiing friend in the butt who draw us into an away match with Wolfsburg in the second Cup round today... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Sammer told in TV this evening that he expects him to help you win the EPL this season...

About the dressing room - in the German team there are a couple of this guys. Champions aren't only made on the pitch but in the dressing room, too. If that functions players will work together on the pitch, too.

1790~~~
He might not have the armband, but he's our captain. There's not a player on that pitch who doesnt look at him and want to follow his example or take notice when he gives you instructions. I remember Roy Keane saying in his book the only difference when he was made captain was he had to give out the tickets to the players for their families and organize nights out. Players like that dont need an armband to lead a team. Sad thing is, Rooney doesnt look like he's living up to his end at the minute. I know he generally takes a while to get going, but he's got to start asking himself if he's doing enough.

1791~~~
Rooney's form has no bearing on his leadership qualities, even Keane had some shite performances but no one up until his outburst questioned his qualities of leadership.

1792~~~
Yeah he doesn't need the armband or anything. He's a leader and doesn't need anything official to confirm that. Hope he starts against Brugge.

1793~~~
Its like having back scholes in-terms of controlling and moving ball and tempo. Always available and cool as feck under a press. Almost tears of joy seeing him come on for us. Its still surreal. Love the man

1794~~~
The man is an absolute stud. No other way to put it. We've been spoilt rotten as fans over the years with the players that have played for us, yet this signing stands out for me. 
An indisputable legend that seems ecstatic to be here. We're lucky.

1795~~~
Excellent point. 

My Mrs gave an exclaimed <i>oh my god</i> this morning at his salt and pepper thing that he's got going on up top. It didn't do it for her, looks like I'll be on the just for men in 10 years as well. Haha. It is still a bit surreal that he's at our club, I really want him to start and play a load of games so it sinks in that he's here.

1796~~~
He's great. Takes one or two touches in situations where Carrick would take two or three. That's not a slight on the latter, btw, just an acknowledgement of how good our fat German is.

1797~~~
After 2 substitute appearances?

1798~~~
Quality player. Has more time than anyone else on the pitch. We wrestled back control of the game when he and Herrera came on.

1799~~~
He probably was one of his favourites before.

1800~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1801~~~
I think I might have underestimated how good he is.

1802~~~
The man's class, this shouldn't be new information as he's been bossing central midfield for the best part of a decade.

Once he's fully fit he should be starting games.

1803~~~
I think it does. It is hard to listen to Rooney shouting at you for a bad pass or miscontrolling a ball when he is running around doing the same. Rooney should thank his lucky stars there is no big egos in the team. Bastians way of playing and actual quality commands more respect, you cant help but listen to him if he is on the pitch.

1804~~~
I think most German and Bayern fans saw the Lahm - Schweinsteiger captaincy sharing relationship (for Bayern and the nationalteam) a bit like that. Lahm was the nice guy doing all the orga stuff off the pitch, that comes with the captaincy, while Schweinsteiger was always the actual leader on the pitch. Not that Lahm didn't merit the captaincy with his incredibly consistent performances on the pitch for more than a decade. But in terms of real leadership, he has been on a different level to Lahm since 2009. And that's no slight on Lahm of course, it's just Schweinsteiger is incredible.

1805~~~
What a situation to have. Bringing on bastian schweinsteiger onto the pitch when you are leading by one goal.

1806~~~
No...

1807~~~
Really liking what he has shown so far. Cannot wait for him to be fully fit and be a starter. Who would have thought fecking Schweinsteiger bossing it in midfield for us.

1808~~~
This. As Keane said. The captain should aim to be the best player on the pitch. Not the freaking worst by a country mile.

1809~~~
I really don't think we can drop points from a winning position after bringing Schweinsteiger on. Absolute total control in midfield, he suffocates the opponent relentlessly and his aura just oozes to our players as soon as he comes on.

1810~~~
What a player!! Just the way he controls the tempo of the game is amazing.. He's not even fully fit,but just seeing him play you knew he was head and shoulders above the rest..

1811~~~
Agree 1000%. It just saddens me he wasn't here 3 years ago....

1812~~~
There was that bit at the end where Rooney was fecking stumbling about and falling over trying to waste time at their corner flag and Schweinsteiger just burst onto the scene, won the ball back with ease and then passed it out. I loved it.

Just a little moment that, but it just shows his class. Once he's fully sit he's going to be great this season. Someone on twitter said he was like a dad that joined in on a kids game when he came on. Just a class above everyone.

1813~~~
I hope he starts on Tuesday, I think he might since we'll likely try to avoid starting Carrick multiple times a week this season.

1814~~~
I think he will to step up his fitness. Reckon he'll play the first hour with Carrick coming on for the last 30 mins.

1815~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/epWYELMalHl/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

One of my favourite moments of the game. Mata plays a fairly dodgy pass in the last 5 seconds of injury time, bouncing just as it reaches Schweinsteiger with players pressing him from both sides, and initially it looks like he's just going to boot it clear as any of our other players would've done. Instead, he flicks it up to himself, plays a near-perfect volleyed pass in behind the defence and puts Rooney through on goal for the first time in the match.

1816~~~
I love watching him play. It's been truly amazing, and it's only been 60 minutes.

1817~~~
At first it seemed like a weird clearance then I realized it was Bastian and he must have spotted a run, Rooney completely fecked it up though. That was a brilliant pass.

1818~~~
... and Rooney rewarded the big man by overrunning it with a slick'nsmoothy neanderthaler touch and a suave'nbrave  hoof towards the sidelines showcasing yet another majestic facet of his repetoire of timewasting. Surely that merited another adulating shower of 'roonehhh roonehhh'??

Added two dots to your post to apply maximum drama with my follow up.

1819~~~
It's a pleasure watching him play in the Utd shirt. Just oozes class. One of the greats.

1820~~~
Give this guy a standing ovation <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1821~~~
Played as many passes in 30 mins as Carrick did in 60 (Herrera played twice as many as Januzaj), fit and healthy a midfield 3 of BFS, Schneiderlin and Herrera makes too much sense.

1822~~~
Beautiful. 
Also that pass was simply outstanding.

1823~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.
That is all.

1824~~~
But he didn't play for United before. Just seems a bit premature.

1825~~~
I imagine we'll see that 3 at some point, I'd just feel a little bad for Carrick as I'm not sure he deserves to lose his place.

1826~~~
Carrick is a great and classy player, probably our most important player over past couples of seasons and I've always been one of his biggest fans, but Schweinsteiger is clearly a level above.

1827~~~
Hopefully bastian will end up better than Milner <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1828~~~
In fairness, Carrick is 34 and usually has a spell out with injury every season due to us needing to play him all the time. Maybe the best thing for Carrick's longevity is to have more options so we can cycle him in and make sure we dont burn him out. That's been the dream for years. Its not been fair that Carrick has had to carry our midfield for these last few years.

1829~~~
He's class. Came on and immediately started controlling things.

1830~~~
I just dont understand why Rooney had to head the ball there.

1831~~~
Schmidfield with Herrera looked much better. I think I'd like Schweinsteiger to start over Carrick

1832~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1833~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> brilliant

1834~~~
Make him captain, manager, president of the club. Give him the key to the city

1835~~~
A bit late to the party, but his performance against Villa was absolutely superb. A class above anyone else on the pitch for those 30 minutes.

A few more games like that, and any lingering doubts will well and truly be banished.

1836~~~
Absolutely no doubts at all about his quality, it's just his fitness. People who were worried that Bayern were willing to let him go because he declined really don't have to worry about that, as it's not his quality when fit that was ever the worry for them. After he recovered from his injury last season and got a run of games, he was still a class above the others. He just wanted to leave Bayern to have one last challenge, but he's still better then any other midfielder they have.

If managed correctly and stays fit, he's the definitely the best midfielder in the league. One occasion where Van Gaal's cautiousness with fitness might be very useful really as he won't risk him unless he is ready.

1837~~~
Yep. Rooney at his best (or any decent form really) would have turned that into clear cut chance, and there were a few other plays like that from Schweiny. He'll have a huge impact for us this seaosn because of his quick forward passing and having the ability to pull it off. Carrick obviously has great vision and is a great passer, but creatively speaking, he has never been as good as Schweinsteiger

1838~~~
He reminds me of Scholes so much. The best players have an awareness and a composure on the ball even when being pressed hard, and he is the epitome of coolness. The vision to control that ball and volley it to Rooney in seconds is fantastic.

1839~~~
Like others, I thought he looked 'different class' when he came on - so assured on the ball and able to dictate the pace of the game.  Only issue is....he looks a bit, erm, portly.  Not sure he could last 90 minutes at the moment until he gets into shape.

1840~~~
Pure class.  We went from being all over the place with Villa trying to put pressure on us to back in control when Schweinsteiger (and Herrera) came on.

1841~~~
Will prove to be <b>the </b>signing of the summer and not just for us but across the whole of the EPL. Let's hope the rest of the team prove up to his level.

1842~~~
Lets hope he stays fit, because if he does, I think you may just be right.

1843~~~
LVg will have to manage his and Carricks games well to get the best out of them. Im interested on how he will do that...

1844~~~
Said when we signed him that a fit Bastian Schweinsteiger is a level above any central midfielder in the league.

1845~~~
Toure seems determiend to regain that title.

1846~~~
Sadly my experience tells he won't, he will hit good form, you sniff the hope, then he will get some Minor, but 2-3 weeks injury either in training or in a cold and rainy game against stoke <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1847~~~
We need him starting with Schneiderlein and preferably Herrera. Carrick is getting on, and frankly, has been a bit sloppy from pre-season til' now. Not terrible at all, but hasn't hit his stride. In pre-season he was caught on the ball a few times, and the same happened against Spurs. Anything less than his best and he shouldn't be playing. I mean, it's only Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger waiting in the wings after all!

1848~~~
He's done is superbly in the first 2 games.

60 mins + 30 mins - Switch the player as necessary.

This could be a great recipe for having 2 healthy, happy top class midfielders who play the exact same role.

1849~~~
Luckily Yaya will have that period when he will be lazy. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1850~~~
I find these negative comments about Carrick's performances so far very strange. I think Carrick has been Carrick. No better o no worse than his performances in the past few seasons.

1851~~~
Same.

1852~~~
Man, I hope you are wrong. Seeing him vs Villa really has me excited!

1853~~~
der Fußballgott is such a badass nickname.

1854~~~
Dont say that. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1855~~~
Sounds more like a gothic footballer

1856~~~
Well Carrick being Carrick would usually involve some poor performances in the opening weeks of the season. Fergie himself said that you only see the best of Carrick from September/October onwards. Which seems to be happening this season. He's definitely been a bit below his usual standards and is rightfully getting subbed off before the end of each game. Which would never happen when he's playing at his best.

1857~~~
Would love to see Schweinsteiger start and get about 70 minutes against Brugge to really kick on his fitness.

1858~~~
I disagree. I think he has played exactly the same way he has for the past few seasons. 

Van Gaal rates Schweinsteiger just as high as Carrick which is why he is happy to take Carrick off in place of the German.

I also think that maybe the backroom staff have indicated Carrick's trend of playing a lot of consecutive 90 minutes as a reason behind his injury problems last season. This would also explain why he is only play 60 minutes of matches. It gives Carrick a nice rest while getting Schweinsteiger's match fitness up to scratch, without any performance change or tactical adjustment. 

This is just a theory of course, but one that makes sense in my head.

1859~~~
Yeah, I reckon he'll start. 

Looking forward to seeing him pull the strings in Europe in our red shit <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1860~~~
Happy to agree to disagree. I think Carrick's been a good bit below his best and you'll see a big improvement in his individual performances in the coming weeks, which will see him get a lot more 90 minutes under his belt. Time will tell.

1861~~~
I think he's nailed on to start.

1862~~~
I hope you're right about the improvement part. The only real difference I can notice about his performance is that he is less willing to play longer, more adventurous passes.

Regardless of all this, I am extremely excited about our MF this season.

I think Carragher wasn't too far wrong last night, Schneiderlin is the PL signing of the summer.

1863~~~
Think he's a cert to start tonight.

1864~~~
I think so too, two cameos to boost his fitness, will play 60-70 minutes tonight I think. He'll be really important with his huge experience.

1865~~~
Go to the doctors

1866~~~
Unleash the beast.

1867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hargreaves Meets Schweinsteiger

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/gnxn" width="560"></iframe>

1871~~~
First goal coming up?

1872~~~
He's injured himself, hasn't he? Looks like he's slightly limping and struggling.

1873~~~
He's come on twice and completely changed the tempo, really good to see.

1874~~~
Hope he's fit enough, he needs to be starting.

1875~~~
Its annoying that when he misplaces passes, commentators still go on like he's absolutely shitting on Carrick .. started very sloppily and then got better as the game went on but not at his best tonight. Very interesting to see if he has the fitness to start a game, right now I would say it is questionable.

1876~~~
The german commentator said that his statistics were good against Brugge. Successfull passes and won tackles over 80%. (Don't know if it's true though.)

1877~~~
Good start but then disappeared a bit. Still not 100% fit I assume

1878~~~
Der General!

Should start instead of Carrick. We were miles better with him instead of Carrick, who was awful.

1879~~~
Struggled a bit fitness wise today, just lacked that sharpness he had on Friday night.

1880~~~
Can't wait to have him fully fit. His mere presence on the pitch gives me confidence.

1881~~~
He looks very heavy to me, needs to get his fitness up to speed.

1882~~~
Played well. Tried a Scholes cross-field pass and completely messed it up though.

1883~~~
I'm not entirely sure he could play 90mins in the prem just yet either. But at least it's not like Anderson's not being able to play 90 minutes.

He may start soon and get 60 minutes or so though.

1884~~~
Fantastic player, solid performance, improvement on carrick

1885~~~
Thought he was good on the ball, as you'd expect, but off the ball, he still seems a bit sluggish to me, and at that time, Brugge were sitting behind the ball, as opposed to pressing high like they did in the first half.

1886~~~
Good cameo by him, calmed our midfield and sprayed a lot of passes, he still needs to get a bit fitter.

1887~~~
Really helped drive us on against a tiring Brugge team, thought he had a great half personally.

1888~~~
Still doesn't look fully fit yet. I think he might get another half at the weekend and then 60 minutes in the second leg.

1889~~~
6m. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1890~~~
Fair play to Bayern, they sold him for peanuts and didnt stay in his way. We did the same with RvP too.

1891~~~
Or 9m EUR. That is what Sportbild told was the transfer sum for him.

But as I stated before - if he wants to leave they will not ask for anything over the odds. It probably did not take much more than a phone call between Rummenigge and Woodwards.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMuQvd3WEAEMn-w.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMuQvd3WEAEMn-w.png"/> 

63 touches, brought stability, played 54 passes, 91 % pass quote

1892~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1893~~~
a fan who was apparently sat in front of him:

1894~~~
No, he's our Basti <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> .. Besides I think I'm in love with him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1895~~~
We gained a great player in Bastian and a super fan in Tobi.

We should sign him. Just because.

1896~~~
Aye, fair play to Rummenigge and Bayern for letting this happen so easily, very classy of them.

The smiley was more an expression of joy, rather than meant to be in mean spirit. It's still slightly surreal that he plays for us now.

1897~~~
Woodward said it was quite a tricky deal to complete in his interview with MUTV. I don't for a second take BILD's figure seriously, they're the same people who said we had bid over €100m for Muller.

1898~~~
Similar to his stats against Villa really. Think he had like 35 passes in just under 30 minutes, and now 54 passes in 45 minutes. Will be getting over 100 passes with a full game.

1899~~~
Maybe with Schweinsteiger - not with Bayern... Ask Hoeneß - his agent was a tough cookie already at the last contract talks in 2011... 

About Müller - I answer you in his thread in the transfer forum!

1900~~~
I'm sure this is the brother who supported United all along. Schweinsteiger did an interview in 2010 I think with Four Four Two mentioning the atmosphere in OT being amazing when he played in the QF, and that his brother was at him, half kidding, to join United, but he said he had to honour his commitment to Bayern.

1901~~~
He only has one brother who is two years older than he is. And yes - it was him that was a United fan.

1902~~~
Great to see him in Europe for us. He is made for it.

1903~~~
Paul Scholes talking about Bastian Schweinsteiger : 
"I have absolutely no idea [why he's not starting]."

As much as I love him, he does come off as quite a tool in terms of analyzing football.

1904~~~
Massive tool and it makes me think he would be an unbelievably shit coach.

1905~~~
The thing I love about him is it feels like he is here for all the right reasons and his eagerness to help the cause is evident. Not as good as he was against Villa but I thought he got a solid 45 minutes under his belt, still carrying a bit too much timber though.

1906~~~
Has a Napoleon complex on TV.

1907~~~
United is too cheap to give him some decent tickets?

1908~~~
Still looks heavy but hopefully he will play more prominent role once he gets his fitness back again.

1909~~~
Looks a bit fat doesnt he? Needs to put the plates down and pick up some weights. His movement is labored so far but what he lacks in fitness he compensates with good vision and leadership in the midfield.

1910~~~
Is his brother good as well? Can't be that far off I would imagine

1911~~~
I think when we start with him, it would be the same problem as we sometimes have with when Carrick is off-beat - slowing the play down. Basti is a great option to control games when we are leading; not sure if he is fit enough right now to dictate games from the start

1912~~~
Not really that good. He played a few seasons in the 2nd and 3rd division in Germany and the last 3 years for Bayern's 2nd team. He retired this summer and is now a coach in our youth academy.

1913~~~
I thought he looked quite off the pace. More of a Spurs than a Villa performance. Scholesy can huff and puff all he wants but BFS doesn't look ready to start a game yet, so I've no problem with him continuing to get cameos off the bench.

1914~~~
Thing I'm realising with Scholesy is that I kind of always took his quiet reticence as a sign of intelligence... wise men listen, rather than shout their mouths of etc. 

But now that he's started taking I've realised that he's actually pretty thick, which is probably the real reason he never used to day much. 

Love him to bits though.

1915~~~
Funny thing is his fitness doesn't seem to get better game by game... sometimes he looks lively, next game he looks off the pace. It is a pattern which has continued from pre season.

1916~~~
Why is he so overweight at the start of a season by the way?

1917~~~
Agreed, But got a funny feeling we will actually see him starting vs Newcastle at the weekend.

1918~~~
So overweight? He isn't overweight at all.

1919~~~
He has impressed me so far without being fully fit. Imagine him even at 90%. Winning leagues etc is great but just being able to watch this guy play in our shirt and everytime he does make our midfield look improved makes me hard.

1920~~~
Ok I thought so, thanks (and thanks for BFS!!)

1921~~~
Have you seen him?  He looks a bit portly to me.  Still class though.

1922~~~
Yeah I wasn't impressed last night. Was he injured at the end of last season or something? Looks nowhere near as sharp as the rest of the squad, and annoyed me a few times by dwelling on the ball. Still good to see him demanding the ball so much, but I'm not sure why he's getting a pass for being blatantly unfit right now.

1923~~~
Very much agree with this.

1924~~~
So, was he 6M or 14M?

1925~~~
Yes, and while he is not fit yet, he isn't 'so overweight'.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1926~~~
Made a dodgy start ,but soon settled down and helped to control the game.

1927~~~
Passes per minute this season in the league:

Bastian - 0.94
Herrera - 0.68
Schneiderlin - 0.61
Carrick - 0.56
Mata - 0.52
Memphis - 0.43
Young - 0.38
Januzaj - 0.27
------
Blind - 0.69
Smalling - 0.53

Admittedly, the sample size is small and the figures are skewed by what period of the matches the players played in... but it's pretty clear how much of a playmaker Schweinsteiger is.

Mata comes out of this pretty well too, imo. He's not a winger, he's an AM who starts out wide so I don't know why people judge him by the standards of a Beckham or Kanchelskis.

1928~~~
No.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/bild/1.2046508.1405345719/900x600/bastian-schweinsteiger.jpg" src="http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/bild/1.2046508.1405345719/900x600/bastian-schweinsteiger.jpg"/>

Just as comparison - a picture from the World Cup. He might have had a little overweight at the beginning of the training - but that might be pretty normal after 5 weeks of holidays.

1929~~~
German sources say 6M, so I'm inclined to believe them.

1930~~~
Carrick is a great player... but in all fairness, Schweini is better. Can't see why Carrick should start ahead of him?

Schn/Schw should be starters in all important games.

1931~~~
Maybe it's £6m upfront and then the rest is dependant on appearances etc? It'd make since given his injuries and fitness concerns.

1932~~~
Brilliant business, really is.

1933~~~
There's no point declaring it an absolute like that. They're beautifully interchangeable and both seem capable of slotting straight in when needed, so we should just play whoever's in better form at the time. During pre-season and the first couple of games that was Carrick, because Schweinsteiger hadn't quite got up to speed yet. Now it looks like it's Bastian, so we should be starting him. If he loses form or fitness at any point, Carrick can come in as first choice again. Etc.

1934~~~
I rather Bastian start over Carrick versus Newcastle. Give him a home game to prove if he is a starter. On the plus side, we get to rest Carrick for Brugge away.

1935~~~
Find it funny how the price that we payed dropped from the initial 20m Euros when the transfer was announced, a few weeks later it was 15m Euros and now it comes out it was just 10m Euros that we payed. Fantastic if true.

1936~~~
For me although Carrick had a few ropey moments I thought we played better when he was on the pitch. Having said that, Rooney seemed to liven up a lot playing with Schweinsteiger so hopefully that becomes a trend.

1937~~~
Schweinsteiger has done pretty well thus far, but you can see how he could play when fully fit. He is just busy. Get it pass it, get it pass it.......... keeps things ticking over brilliantly. When he does get fit I think its an easy decision that he'll start ahead of Carrick.

1938~~~

Interesting...

Fredi Binder - who Bayern got rid off after last season (he was very close to Müller-Wohlfahrt - he worked for Bayern for 36 years - gets flown in to Manchester vor Bastian...

1939~~~
What's the story, he's hired him as a personal physio or the club has?

1940~~~
Hoping Basti starts tomorrow and proves a lot of people wrong - still world class IMO

1941~~~
Absolutely, I love Carrick but a fully fit Schweinsteiger is clearly ahead of him. It's going to be great to have the chance to rotate with those two over the course of the season.

1942~~~
Moreover I think a more rested Carrick will be better for the team and for himself, it's hard for him to play consecutively. He is a bit old and more than ever his fitness has to be managed intelligently.

1943~~~
So they were never re-instated? i thought that calmer heads would prevail..Bayern have a new medical team now?

1944~~~
I'd like to see him play from the start tomorrow. We'll be better for it.

1945~~~
Does anyone know what it says? <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a> ?

1946~~~
I generally agree but I'd like to accommodate Carrick in his natural role when we do play him, as a holding player in a three. This would make a lot of sense given that the squad balance has shifted from top heavy to overly stocked in midfield, and would allow us to play Herrera in his optimal role alongside Schneiderlin.

When we want to play in the current system, I think Schweinsteiger should be in ahead of Carrick when possible. Horses for courses and all that...

1947~~~
Schweini's longterm physio will be flown to Manchester several times each week to treat Schweini's precious muscles. The rest just tells the history of the physio at Bayern, who worked for 36 years at the club.

1948~~~
Im not Balu. But the most of the article is telling the story again who Fredi Binder is etc. (worked 36 for Bayern, the players trusted him, was set free by Bayern after last season etc.) - that is why I did not translate that. The main part is that he gets flown into Manchester a couple of times to take care of Bastian and that that is not selfevident as United has its own team. But - that van Gaal knows Binder and the relationship he has to Schweinsteiger.

For Binder Christian Huhn came in as a physio. He worked for the German national team before.

Bayern works together with the doctor who before took care of the U23 (he was always stationed in the house) - and with several experts out of the surrounding - Müller-Wohlfahrt is one of them. As the players of the national team and Ribery and Robben will anyways go to Müller-Wohlfahrt...

1949~~~
Thanks mate!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Thank you, too.

1950~~~
Hope he is starting today... Your match starts at 13:45 and Bayern's at 15:30...

1951~~~
A home game vs Newcastle, perfect match to start him now that he's had a few matches under his belt.

1952~~~
Having watched Schweinsteiger closely at home games I still think he's playing within himself. He still looks laboured. I'd still have him coming on when the opposition gets tired until he gains full match fitness.

1953~~~
Pretty much. 

I'd even have Herrera ahead with easier opponents who just sit back with just one of Carrick, Schweini or Schneiderlin holding.

1954~~~
If he starts alongside Schneiderlin, it'll be a good idea for him to start. Him and Carrick don't fit.

1955~~~
Although very similar, they've hardly played together to yet come that conclusion.

1956~~~
He's still getting back to full fitness. This was a few days back : 

"I am fit, I am getting fitter," Schweinsteiger told Sky Sports. "I had long holidays this summer and I came a little bit late to the team, and then I had a small calf injury in America, which was not perfect. "But I am getting in better and better shape and within one or two weeks I will be at the highest level and then I can play like I want.

1957~~~
A metronomic general. Never shuts up. Never stops. Always gives good passes. Fußballgott.

1958~~~
Eh. Not convinced he's been any better than Carrick has been so far this season in my opinion.

1959~~~
His high pressing alone has been better

1960~~~
Meh. More balls getting past him though

1961~~~
Started well and then got that knock, he does look like he's carrying a bit too much of Snake Eyes pet Wolf though.

1962~~~
Great start but faded away after a knock. Should start the next game too.

1963~~~
I thought he was very good in patches today and really gave our build up play an extra dimension, shame the entire team faded but he himself was very strong.

1964~~~
I thought before the knock he was good. After that he seemed to drop away a bit.

1965~~~
Turned out to be a cut on his ankle, sounds like it's nothing serious thankfully.

1966~~~
Hope he is ok.

1967~~~
Shame he's not fully fit yet. I'd have kept him on if possible. Carrick on for Schneiderlin.

1968~~~
First game - 20 mins or so (iirc)
second game - 30 mins or so
third game - 45 mins
fourth game - 60 mins

The Management of LvG

1969~~~

1970~~~
Played well. Getting back to fitness slowly but surely. He will be very important for us.

1971~~~
Thought he was very good today. His passing isn't quite as penetrative as Carrick's, but he's still capable of driving with the ball to draw defenders to him, which is something we've really missed in central midfield the last few years.

1972~~~
Dont think he was too good

Not good enough yet to replace carrick

1973~~~
Still not fit, you could see at times when he was tracking back he'd put his head down as if he was knackered. But having the quality and experience of Bastian "fooking" Schwensteiger still makes me smile.

1974~~~
Don't think he has been all that great yet.  Certainly is not fit enough and has made more bad passes than I would've expected.  I hope he comes good for us.

1975~~~
Carrick was not good when he came on and not great against Brugge. I'd say they're on par.

When Scweinsteiger is playing, Schneiderlin sits in front of the defense. When Carrick is playing Schneiderlin moves further up. At this point I'd think that Carrick is competing with Schneiderlin more than he is competing with Schweinsteiger.

1976~~~
He was rubbish. Needs to shed some weight.

1977~~~
Rubbish! Although he might not be dominating, it has nothing to do with his legs and it's only the first game he starts. Of course everyone is full of expectation. The time he's on the pitch, he showed he's still got it, IMH0. Give him time t0 get get fit FFS. To make this kind of assessment is amateurish.

1978~~~
Why do these signings cause so much polarization? Every game hes either been very good or crap.

Hes been alright, certainly better than what you had. Anyone expecting the Bastian of 5 years ago would have been a fool anyway.

1979~~~
Based on four half games. Riiiiiiiiiight.

1980~~~
He certainly wasn't rubbish....  

Haha, yes, what a strange conclusion of the article.

1981~~~
This. He was definitely better than the Carrick of the first two games, so that's an improvement. I honestly don't know what people expect of him.

1982~~~
People seem to always love dealing in extremes. But yeah, he's been okay so far, although you'd hope he still has a lot more to offer us even if he's not at his best level as such.

1983~~~
Neat and tidy, but not physically at it. It's understandable because he's not match fit.

As an aside, Van Gaal needs to pick a more adventurous midfield.

1984~~~
It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself that's the case more than anything else. He's potentially the best midfielder in the league and that's not remotely exaggerating.

1985~~~
I think Herrera should have come in instead of him, not Carrick.

1986~~~
Yep.

1987~~~
Schneiderlin's passing doesn't convince me. Slows down / breaks down a lot of moves. Early days, mind.

1988~~~
No. But in all seriousness hes hardly been crap, hes  certainly a more calming influence on the team in midfield than it was, it no longer gets so easily dominated.

1989~~~
Start him, start him etc. Today showed why LVG has been gradually easing him in, he's clearly not fully fit yet.

1990~~~
It's not his job though to do the pretty passing though, but he's still been very decent, he's in a new team playing, in a more restricted role. He's been fantastic at breaking up play + adding a bit of steel, his primary role for the team.

1991~~~
True. Makes you worry for Chelsea's midfield though, really. If they couldn't even manage more than 30% possession at home to a United midfield containing Rooney, Fellaini and Herrera then what chance do they have against Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.

1992~~~
Bastian is not ready to play 90 minutes and that was painfully obvious today. He ran out of fuel 40ish minutes and could barely move after that.

1993~~~
To be fair to him, he took a sore looking whack to the heel/ankle. He ran it off a bit, but eventually had to come off as he didn't look comfortable. BT confirmed he had a gash as a result.

1994~~~
It could be the reason but then again why did he play injured for so long if it was?

1995~~~
We'll have 25% possession,  we'll win 2-0.

1996~~~
Because he's Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

No, I agree, he should have been taken off earlier if it resulted in a cut, or it could have been made worse. Perhaps he didn't know about it right away. I did like what we saw of him starting though. And I like the dynamic of bringing him off and swapping him with an equally adept player of similar quality with fresh legs. Swapping Carrick for Schweinsteiger, and vice versa, has given our play a good injection of composure each time. I hope both can stay fit with such rotation for the length of the season.

1997~~~
Easily good enough for that. Just needs to get his fitness levels back up.

1998~~~
Nowhere near his best but lacks match fitness so I guess he'll improve.

1999~~~
I wouldn't say he's been poor. I would say he has been underwhelming though. That's probably down to fitness however, just needs to keep building.

2000~~~
Not a bad game but he still looks a bit rusty.

2001~~~
Thought he did well. Still has a bit to go but the signs are there that once he gets going, he will slot straight in.

2002~~~
He was great until he got that foul in the back then was just good thereafter. Still not ready for 90 mins in the PL. I hope it's nothing a little rest won't fix (i.e. leave him on the bench for Brugge if possible).

2003~~~
He has to learn how to pass better & quicker though (or get into form if he knows how to already). We need more of an Alonso than a Wanyama in his role so the sooner he starts passing quickly & precisely the better. Right now he limits our CM when we have the ball as it stands as he doesnt make many forward passes and elave sit up to Blind, Carrick or Schweinsteiger..

2004~~~
I thought he played well until the knock took the stuffing out of him. He always seems to be playing the ball forward rather than sideways and I think his inclusion is a real plus. Maybe not quite 100% match fit but he's an imposing presence and one of those players who you think 'yeah we are going to be ok today' when he's in.

2005~~~
That's exactly how I felt when I saw him play. He was always in control. Like an island of stability. Till the knock, I agree.

2006~~~
No... 
He does not know how to pass good and quick... 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IyVBeJioNL0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2007~~~
I speak under correction BW, but he might be talking about Schneiderlin. Not Bastian. We all know or should know what a good passer Bastian is.

2008~~~
Sorry... Just read the sentences and thought he meant Schweinsteiger... and thought - hmmmmm. Where did he think he comes from...

2009~~~
No worries man. I'd have thought the same if I wasn't following the conversation earlier.

2010~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR55D5OKcNU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

His influence on the team's passing is very evident here. Look at his average position when on the ball AND off it; specifically the amount of time he was around the penalty box/left touchline area.

He played a lot of balls forward and always tried to look for that more progressive pass. Carrick came on, played good and added that urgency but his natural instinct, game and his mobility means he is always sat in the centre circle. He doesn't press because he lacks the athleticism and he doesn't dribble/move forward with the ball because he's happy to sweep things up. Unfortunately for us, that also means he's rarely an outlet for those passing triangles further up the pitch and he rarely ever moves <b>with</b> the ball. He's so relient and comfortable just passing to feet that he's forgotten he can advance several yards of unobstructed space himself.

Schweinsteiger will sit deep if the game calls for him but his natural tendancy is to move the ball forward and create situations for attacking play. He and Carrick, will never last as a 2 man midfield but if Schweinsteiger is fit, he should start any day of the week.

2011~~~
Thats why we should play in a 3 man midfield with Herrera

2012~~~
^Hope LVG comes to his senses. A 3 man midfield would probably be asking too much. Just having Herrera as one of the two would be gold already. Imo he would work well with ANY of the other 3.

2013~~~
Its amazing how little off the ball movement and how slow United are compared to Bayern V City video.

2014~~~
He's great. Would love to see him and Herrera start ahead of Schneiderlin/Carrick one game with no number 10.

2015~~~
I <i>was</i> talking about Schneiderlin... in response to legball.

2016~~~
That is a pass!

2017~~~
Superb ball to Herrera for the 4th goal, exactly what we need from him.

2018~~~
Bastian FECKING Schweinsteiger.

2019~~~
What a fecking pass!!!

2020~~~
He gets in the game and it starts raining goals.

2021~~~
Filthy pass. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2022~~~
It's not even funny as to how influential he has been since he came on.

2023~~~
Excellent ball for Herrera, not sure what he was thinking with that last counter-attack, though. He's great to watch - Brugge are terrified of him.

2024~~~
Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger.

2025~~~
Schweinsteiger coming on has been more key to our second half performance than Herrera's resurgence IMO. Aside from that shanked ball to the wing he's not put a foot wrong, and what an assist

2026~~~
You can just tell he's a fantastic footballer. Itching to see him fully fit and against the bigger teams.

2027~~~
Ball with eyes it's called. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2028~~~
One of the better passes I have ever seen.

2029~~~
My goodness. I am considering doing dirty things while watching that pass tonight.

2030~~~
He's brilliant.

2031~~~
Such a good footballer, his experience is going to be so helpful in the CL.

2032~~~
Genuinely think a fully fit Schweinsteiger would be the best player in the league.

2033~~~
sat the centre half on his arse with a 40 yard pass.....thats some talent! 
so much more to come from him in a united shirt once he's fully fit and in the groove

2034~~~
Pass of the season so far.

2035~~~
Agreed

2036~~~
That pass was beyond ridiculous.

2037~~~
Should be a starter now, going forward I'd love to see a midfield 3 of the BS and MS with Ander in an advanced role.

2038~~~
I was screaming for that pass being played once I've seen Herrera started his run. And yeah great pass under pressure too, we should be doing this more often..

2039~~~
Yes, the pass was quality, but what he really added was control, once he came on Brugge getting through on our goal ceased.

2040~~~
that pass split one direction up!

2041~~~
You know what i like about BFS? He talks a lot. This surely has an immense effect on the lads. Love him here

2042~~~
I still can't believe we have Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger

2043~~~
Feckstian Basting Fecksteiger

2044~~~
Can he come on at half time every game please <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2045~~~
Love it

2046~~~
In Carrick, Bastian and Herrera, we probably have the best midfield in the league. We should make the most of it before the older two are over the hill.

2047~~~
Thanks Bayern. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2048~~~
He plays for Manchester United.

2049~~~
We need a gif of that pass. It was fantastic.

2050~~~
What are they saying?

2051~~~

2052~~~
What a peach of a pass. Lovely.

2053~~~
I want to sleep with that pass it was that beautiful.

2054~~~
Nice, cheers <a class="username" data-user="54006, @Unlikely lad" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54006/">@Unlikely lad</a>!

2055~~~
The pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2056~~~
"Deutsche Football Meister, Bastian..."

2057~~~
One of the best passes I can remember from a United player in the last few years.

2058~~~
Ahh german football master <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> is that from before the match or when he was still at Bayern?

2059~~~
Think it was earlier before the game, his brother put the video up on Twitter!

2060~~~
You forgot to mention the most important and perhaps the best player in our midfield.

2061~~~
That is genuinely one the best passes i've seen in a long time. That doesn't even say something about the state our midfield has been in since the days of Scholes & Carrick, because it was so insanely good. That centre-back will have nightmares about it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2062~~~
He also made a great pass just moments after he came on; I think it was the Rooney penalty call. 6m pounds for potentially the best CM in the league sounds like a good deal to me.

2063~~~
It seems to be United fans singing in Brügge... (it is not Germans singing - you hear the accents...)

2064~~~
Obviously he might have come anyways for Van Gaal or because of our history, but we're lucky that Real or Chelsea didn't realize that even if healthy for only half a year, he'd be a massive signing for them.

2065~~~
Sheesh - watched the game (sort of - was in a browser in background while at work). Didn't realize how good that pass is - with 2 players bearing down on him and threading it perfectly with the right weight ... nice.

Though to me the best pass in recent times is still Herrera to Mata at Anfield <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2066~~~
Wow!!! That was orgasmic! Just noticed that he was actually closed down by two Brugge players and he did not panic and just calmly slotted that pass. Not everyone can do that. Completely agree with many of the comments here that he is going to be important in those vital CL games along with PL games. Plus, he is still not fully fit. A fully fit, raring to go Basti would be a sight to admire!

2067~~~
I still cannot believe we have signed Bastian Schweinsteiger...

2068~~~
I get all excited watching that pas.. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2069~~~
Here's that pass from the other angle.

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/ejU6EZw5gDv/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

That one second delay on the pass is critical - sucks the two opposition players in and gives Herrera the time to make that break forward.

2070~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger! Glorious.

2071~~~
That pass is ridiculous because it seems like the ball is too close to his standing foot and therefore it would make the pass much more difficult but he pulled it off with some ease.

2072~~~
Love him to bits, What i have noticed plenty of times he plays first time passes alot, Carrick for all his class doesn't play too many first time passes. and he tries some very difficult passes at times. I feel with him we will be far more creative going forward than Carrick. Yesterday him and Herrera there were so many ocassions when they played very difficult first time passes which other players might have taken two touches, and it increased the tempo of our play in the second half to the extent Brugge couldnt keep up with it.

2073~~~
That pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2074~~~
That pass just didn't make any sense. 
The average person wouldn't try that but it's like he saw the run but he didn't see any opposition players in the way and nailed it.
Enjoying the midfield options this season.
Should have a top central midfield every game.

2075~~~
Van Gaal said a very smart thing about him recently: "Schweinsteiger is a <i>coaching </i>player." I think this is a perfect description. Whenever he plays he gesticulates and conducts all the time and every teammate. If a young boy would do that, the others would hate him for sure. But a BFS is allowed to do so imo. Even more because he is not only critizing ("You should have played that pass") but also gives positive feedback on the pitch if I interpret his gestures correctly.

2076~~~
That song is great! Is it from his Bayern days or was it made by our fans?

2077~~~
delighted we signed this guy.

2078~~~
My jaw is still on the floor.

2079~~~
It is a famous Bayern chant, but the Bayern fans sing "Deutscher Fußballmeister... FCB" ("German Footballchampions... FCB" stands for FC Bayern)

2080~~~
I think the pass to Rooney before that penalty incident was bloody sublime too.

2081~~~
Still can't get over that pass <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2082~~~
I'm glad you guys are enjoying him. He's in good hands and that's good. I'd hate it if he wasn't appreciated. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Edit: Also... GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK IN THE CL! Let's break that spanish dominance. 5 teams, I'm getting sick just thinking about it... :P

2083~~~
Quite possibly one of the least true things I've read in my life.

2084~~~
Sorry but that is just not true.

2085~~~
Fussballgott. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2086~~~
Completed 57 of 59 passes in 45 minutes yesterday... Tends to average more then a pass per minute as well. You can tell he's getting closer and closer to full fitness. Hopefully he doesn't pick up a knock while away on international duty though. Van Gaal is the perfect manager to manage his fitness IMO so I can see him doing well on the injury front this year... So long as he doesn't pick them up while he's with the national team.

2087~~~
He's going to be an absolute monster when he's fully fit.

2088~~~
Played well yesterday, has an excellent passing range. Currently my favorite United player. Next is Herrera. Both are brilliant additions to United. Always wanted him to come here. Great guy.

2089~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2PFr-TDV14?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2090~~~
Best thing about him is that he tries to play first time passes whenever possible.

2091~~~
In response, this:

(I know koroux is taling about Bastian here)

Carrick is far too content on playing the status quo. I'm not undervaluing his discipline and other passing strengths but he is not a tempo setter of the highest calibre. Case in point? His midfield partner Scholes, who was a one-touch passer and played triangles all over the pitch to set HIS pace. Carrick is happy to play as the game goes. Of course we've seen many instances where Carrick has brilliantly injected life into the game but for a player of his ability, it's never been frequent enough for my liking. As such, square-ball Carrick is equally an unfair AND fair critique. 

There's a style clash that I can appreciate because you can put any two very different players against each other and make one look bad but even taking that into account, Carrick's ability on the ball has actually been overshadowed by his tactical positioning and discipline. Of course I'm being harsh but it's only because I expect more from a good player.

2092~~~
Just adding a bit of wisdom about Schweinsteiger, from a German who has watched him since he was 19:

Over the years he has developed into something English football probably doesn't know: A box-to-box midfielder without the running. That doesn't mean he's not running, when fit. He will occassionally show up everywhere, on both wings too -- his left foot is very good too! But he's too smart to do it all day long.

What is true, though, but not because of his age: He should have somebody next to him in order to do a good part of the dirty work. Why wasting him on that? You're not paying him for cleaning up. But he will take care if necessary.

His brilliance shines when he has the game in front of him, sometimes on the 6, or at the 8, or at the 10. He will play all those spots at times. He can control a game, sure. And he can pass, oh boy, he can pass. I have seen several of the most brilliant vertical passes ever from him. Xavi like. And those passes had to go usually into a 10-men wall that Bayern is always facing.

Stay tuned until he has adjusted to his teammates. And I mean 'adjusting to his teammates': As soon as he knows exactly how they are playing and running, he will deliver them. And then you'll enjoy the real Bastian.

2093~~~
That pass is as hypnotic as Kate Upton's boobs.

2094~~~
I'd say this is a rather accurate description of Carrick. He's showed he's capable of quick one touch football, capable of dangerous through balls and beautiful long passes. It's just he doesn't display those beautiful qualities on the same frequency Bastian does. Carrick's best season was in the last PL won by Utd, he was something else and he was consistently good.

2095~~~
Yeah, getting the right power and accuracy for that with such a short follow through is just something class.

2096~~~
When I play with my friends, if the ball is too close to my standing foot, most of the time, whatever I attempt to do (pass or shoot) turns into shit. This is what directly caught my eye.

2097~~~
With every day that goes by, this signing just gets better and better for me. When the links first came up, I tried to stay out of all the excitement because I wasn't convinced it was the right move by United, even though I knew his quality. But every time you see him in the United shirt, interviews and passes like the one to Herrera (on top of finding out it was only 6 or so million), it is just a brilliant signing.

I think (and expect him to) van Gaal really needs to manage him, when you see what he can bring, there will be a natural pressure to use him but we need to get as much football out of him as possible over the next few seasons.

2098~~~
That pass the other night was otherworldly. So, so good.

This signing is a steal. I find it odd it's been met with so much scepticism elsewhere. He's 31, not dead.

2099~~~
Lyrics can and were extended depending on titles won that year. I've heard it sung with Lyrics "Deutscher Fussballmeister - deutscher Pokalsieher  - Europapokalsieger - Weltpokalsieger - Audi-Cup sieger" (in that order <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>)

2100~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

2101~~~
The best single pass for United that I can remember.

2102~~~
No shit.

2103~~~
Behave.

2104~~~
Name one that was better?

2105~~~
I'm sure Scholes has produced better passes. To label a pass as the best pass ever, that should have been defended better is some call and I can't agree with it. Taking nothing away from this great pass but if Falcao wasn't playing CB, it would have been a straight forward interception.

Again, it's a great ball but that's it.

2106~~~
I said in my memory as I can' recall a better single pass.

2107~~~
Passes are not goals, they don't stick out in the memory as much. I can't remember some passes from last week so this one is easy to remember.

2108~~~
Nothing surprises me about Basti, world class gonna world class.

2109~~~
A few of Xavi's stick in my mind and one of Rooney's in the 2008 CL final. Also a back healed touch from Ronaldo to Rooney against Portsmouth I think that set Rooney through to score.

2110~~~
With all due respect, piss off. You've never seen me play <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2111~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2112~~~
It's still amazing to see him on the pitch for us.  Thanks Bayern.

2113~~~
Rooney's pass to RVP against Villa and numerous passes from Carrick in the last 3 years.

2114~~~
Rooney's flick to Depay's horrible miss was among the best I've watched in recent years too.

2115~~~
Nah, not for me. Rooney's pass to RVP was great but enhanced by the finish. Schweisteiger's was a glorious defence splitting pass from an awkward starting point.

2116~~~
That's obviously subjective but you are wrong.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2117~~~

Skip to 1.07... Always the one I remember when talking about best United pass. The importance of it too was huge as it sparked that comeback, pretty sure Liverpool were top at the time too so it meant we reclaimed top spot.

Edit - I know we are getting off topic now but that is up there with Rooney's greatest performances for us

2118~~~
That third goal gave me goosebumps. What a game.

2119~~~
Think that was the only time we had Rooney, Ronaldo, Tevez and Berbatov on at the same time wasn't it? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2120~~~
Berbatov too. That touch at 1.40 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2121~~~
To be fair he did say the best pass *he* can remember.

2122~~~
Toure for example is 32 and still a massive part of City's midfield. See Carrick too.

2123~~~
Scholes' flicked pass over the Milan defence to Rooney? (I think it was Milan..) Different types of pass obviously but that was genius.

2124~~~
So bloody true. I really do get the feeling we're going to see a good season from him. He's had a good rest this summer, one that he's obviously needed, and we're in a position where we can really manage his appearances to get the best out of him.


Quality wise he's up there with Scholes, who was the same age in 2006...

2125~~~
Carrick's to Hernandez vs Newcastle in stoppage time when it was still 3-3 was pretty good, considering the situation and all...

2126~~~
The Scholes comparison at that age could actually be quite a good one for Schweinsteiger. He might arguably be past his prime in that he'll probably be nowhere near as energetic (maybe not the best word for it) as he once was, but his sublime passing ability is still there and will undoubtedly add a lot to our side.

2127~~~
Has he retired from the NT? I can't remember if he has/hasn't.

2128~~~
Nope, took over the captaincy from Lahm and wants to lead us to glory next year at Euro in France. I'm sure he will.

2129~~~
Damn, Schweiny is making me like the German team a bit. I just had the dirty feeling of being happy to see him lift that title!

2130~~~
No amount of Bastian love will make me do that. A certain keeper in a certain semi final took care of that.

2131~~~
Looking back at that WC, the 2 best teams were quite clearly France and Germany. Such a shame that the game was such a drab affair.

2132~~~
I think he's talking about the 1982 World Cup. Neuer might be a bit of a cnut, but he's really really harmless in comparison to Schumacher.

2133~~~
Ofcourse he is. 

Poor Battiston <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2134~~~
That game was hardly a drab affair was it?

EDIT: Just saw your reply. Nvm.

2135~~~
Yeah, I still like German posters though <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2136~~~
Skepticism is only because he came to UTD. If he went anywhere else, he would be called the marquee signing who will turn the team around.  Because its us, he needs to be undermined so that the argument for another saga for a World Class signing can be created.

I am loving every minute of watching him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2137~~~
A loobed assist by Scholes from the edge of the area comes to mind.  Don't remember who scored the goal

2138~~~
Was the Ac Milan semi-final first leg 06/07 and Rooney scored the goal to make it level.

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x1x22w?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

2139~~~
I would like to add this pass too:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjWdUOJvbaM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>


Shit quality, but one of the best passes I've seen by a United player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2140~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Scholesey <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2141~~~
You're thinking of Ronaldo back heel for Tevez against Birmingham.

2142~~~
Carrick to Hernandez vs Chelsea at OT. The header from chicha was a hell of a header too, lobbed check.

Someone please find a video..

2143~~~
I'm glad someone else agrees with me. I think he's gets a pass (no pun intended) far too often for me.

Anyways the videos in this thread, what nostalgia, Rooney being brilliant on the left wing, prime Nani, Berbatov's class touch...

2144~~~
That was fantastic.

2145~~~
Or the Ronaldo backheel for Rooney in the 4-0 vs Villa, April 2008. Great goal - Rooney went round the keeper and scored. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2146~~~
Also, the goal from Berba or Tevez I think when Tevez and Rooney combined in the box against Middlesborough

2147~~~
Cantons to Irwin in 92/93 season.

2148~~~
That goal was pure sex.

2149~~~
Thanks!  It was a great pass <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2150~~~
Nani skinned Thiago Silva on that one. Thiago probably thought he had it under control until Nani conjured up a trivela.

2151~~~
Ended a run of 8 (i think) headed goals in a row for Rooney

2152~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMOJBcqdKDA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Not actually as good as I remember it being but still a beaut.

2153~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xC2raLtad8M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This one always comes to mind for me when thinking of Veron.  Crap video though.

2154~~~
How about Giggs to rvp vs west ham?

2155~~~
He is struggling to keep up today

2156~~~
Looks off the pace. Needs to step it up a gear.

2157~~~
I thought he was really good on the ball, slows it a bit, but then that seems the general style we're looking to play, slow, but as long as you keep the ball it doesn't matter

2158~~~
Loses every 50/50 challenge today, got caught out a few times. Bring Carrick on

2159~~~
Thought he was running the game mostly... A few lost challenges, but played plenty of good passes as well and is a big source of creativity that the others don't show.

2160~~~
Having a centre-mid who's afraid of a tackle is not helping.

2161~~~
Loosing out to many times today. Need to get justed to the EPL tempo.

2162~~~
***Glass half-full head on***

Some of us <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/bastian-schweinsteiger-signed-for-mufc-confirmed.404903/page-71#post-17761119">voiced doubts</a> when he signed. His injury problems were no secret, he was 31, and he was coming to a very fast and physical league. We were shouted down. Guardiola then <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9934171/pep-guardiola-questions-fitness-of-manchester-uniteds-bastian-schweinsteiger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">came out and said</a> he hasn't been fully fit for 3 years, and people ignored even that, because he's BFS.

But if we can start to talk about Rooney being past it at 29, why not Schweinsteiger at 31?

He's neat, he's tidy, he has an eye for a pass, but he's looked off the pace mostly, and lacks dynamism.

2163~~~
He's one of the few who actually wanted the ball today and yes he was bit iffy in some situations, I thought his skill on the ball at times was class.

2164~~~
He looked tidy without affecting anything. He still looks pretty overweight as well. Hope he's not here for the payday.

2165~~~
Started the 2nd well after I thought he was done for in the first. But after they scored I thought he was the worst player on the pitch

2166~~~
I think the last week and a bit pours cold water on the idea that either Chelsea or United have  anywhere near the best midfield in the league.

2167~~~
Yeah basically this. I still think he's not 100% optimal physical condition and this is the reason why he fades late in the games..

2168~~~
Have to admit I expected more. Hopefully just a slow atart

2169~~~
He can't play in a midfield 2 he's not dynamic enough. People say Toure is done in a 2 man midfield but he's even worse. I think if he's playing as the DM in a 3 man midfield then fine he can use his passing and positioning, but today showed in a fast tempo game he gets caught out too often. Didn't really influence the game positively either that I can remember.

2170~~~
His quality on the ball was well off. Should've been subbed off after we scored. Carrick is a better passer of the ball that's for sure.

2171~~~
He looked shattered today, I think at the moment he's best in the latter day Scholes role of coming on later on when the cut and thrust has lessened in midfield.

2172~~~
No "fecking" today unfortunately <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2173~~~
Not at the races today, but that scorpion kick he did about mid-way through the first half was lovely!

2174~~~
Completely agree. He should be coming on for Carrick; the two of them on together - not such a great idea, in my opinion.

2175~~~
Seems like Anderson's local chippy have some business back after almost becoming bankrupt when he left.

2176~~~
Din't really understand Louie subbing Schneiderlin instead of Schwein.

2177~~~
He always has that class about him which will always make him class above anyone else on the pitch, but at times he looks like some young midfielder who is finding his feet and has problems with his ball control. I am probably harsh but I'll always compare him with Scholes and say that Scholes never looked so amateurish when controlling the ball like he does at certain moments(not all the time!). I am talking about those moments when he makes at least 5 extra touches when running with the ball or turning around with it.

2178~~~
Needs to cut out the German Kebabs. He's seriously unfit and looked knackered at half-time.

Once he sheds the pounds and gains that extra pace, he'd be immense in the middle.

2179~~~
Lacks the engine to play highly intense games in EPL, hopefully, it is a temporary issue, not a permanent.

2180~~~
Clearly isn't fit enough to start games in the PL.

His best performances have all been as a sub when the other team is tired.

2181~~~
We had most of the ball and controlled that match. I dont know what you guys are expecting from a 'controlling' midfielder. He had the most passes in the game, the most interceptions and tackles. He is not going to be playing those passes like the one from the other day every match. There's a reason we were all wanking ourselves to that assist - It was not an everyday pass!

But yeah, he is clearly unfit etc etc...Such a british/english thing to say.

2182~~~
i only watched the second half from the 1:2 on and would say he was his usual self (after having watched him the last decade or so almost every game). I think he had a certain presence and commanded the buildup play well until Smalling came on and he moved up a bit. Players around him seemed to seek him out too, which is a hint about his standing in the team. Solid passing, unspectacular, that's his style. Couldn't really say he looked "off pace" to me, the whole match in that period wasn't exactly a burner.
I was more concerned about other things i saw, like the many crosses that went just about anywhere.

2183~~~
Could potentially be a problem for him, unfortunately. Might be that since he's getting older, he's still got plenty of ability, but is just going to struggle fitness wise.

Hopefully it's not permanent or anything, but it's not as if he's just arrived: the seasons underway and he's featured for us on several occasions now. Even if his fitness is a problem, you'd hope his quality can outweigh that.

2184~~~
Has done well imo. Ppl expecting wonders from him it seems.

2185~~~
Given their ages the "midfield is sorted!" stuff is a bit misleading, it has  sticking plaster over it for now, but we are relying on a 34 year old and a 31 year old who has had a number of fitness issues over the last 2 years, putting them together is fine against a lesser team in the CL but not in a PL game.

2186~~~
Think he's being given quite an easy ride on here. Comfortably one of our worst players yesterday, bar Romero and Rooney.

2187~~~
fair point.

Morgan/Herrera/Perrera ...plus another for the future...

2188~~~
I am confident he'll come good for us.

2189~~~
Anyone see the Germany game? How did he do?

2190~~~
Had a good game.

2191~~~
Had a pretty decent game and kept things ticking along. My heart was in my mouth when he went down clutching his ankle, esp considering Carrick's injury but he was fine soon enough.

2192~~~
Played well looked a class above all the other midfielders

2193~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/COVMyQbUAAIMQAt.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/COVMyQbUAAIMQAt.jpg"/>

2194~~~
Liverpool is going to be a big test for Basti this weekend. Milner/Henderson might not be the best players in the world, but they're the type that won't give our players a second to settle on the ball, they'll be all over them. And thats when Basti has struggled so far this season. Really hope he can up a level or two with the physical and pace side of his game. He's looked at his best when he's been coming on as a sub, and the opposition are tired and the game has slowed down. 

That was, and still is, my biggest concern with Basti in the PL. On the ball, he's class, obviously.

2195~~~
He had a good game and kept play ticking over nicely. Hopefully more of the same against Liverpool with Carrick definitely out.

2196~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> all of our players gets caught under quality pressure as our off the ball movement is non existent....

2197~~~
Great photo.

2198~~~
Blind's a good defensive mid and there's Fellaini too. Pearson could turn out to be up to the first team aswell. I reckon we might just need to sign one central midfielder once Carrick and Schweini have had it, one that's like both of them - older and wiser. The 27/28 year old midfielders now. We're certainly set in centre mid more than any other position!

2199~~~
Lovely picture

2200~~~
Exactly, Gundogan and Gotze in particular always gave Bastian an out ball due to good movement and their ability to receive it under pressure

2201~~~
Bastian was excellent last night, I hope we play Morgan and Herrera alongside him versus Liverpool as they he will tear that Liverpool midfield to pieces. Such a great signing and the significance of it is at times like this when Carrick is injured. No one is worried about a drop of in class as we have Bastian.

2202~~~
So he actually cost £6.5m?
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-transfer-bastian-schweinsteiger-10018422" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ited-transfer-bastian-schweinsteiger-10018422</a>

2203~~~
Yes. Rosenheim, his first club, gets 38.000 EUR out of it and they confirmed the transfer sum of 9m EUR on their homepage.

2204~~~
Looks like it … bargain!

2205~~~
How long did he have on his contract again?

2206~~~
Think it was one year. Not sure though.

People thought he cost £15m? I could've sworn it was always rumoured as <£10m... Maybe it's just the people always believing the "omg united spent 10x the asking price" shit in the media...

2207~~~
If he steps up his game, it could turn out to be a massive bargain. 

Still has a lot to prove though.

2208~~~
Yeah when the rumours first came out it was something like £14m. £6.5m is such a brilliant deal.

2209~~~
Ahh right, I don't remember that at all! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2210~~~
Don't get overexcited. <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> will probably soon find a reliable source which claims that we are really paying £25m.

2211~~~
For Kane maybe!

2212~~~
<a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> please come and revise his transfer fee so we don't get fooled by official statement from his previous club. £30m was the true fee!

2213~~~
Nice windfall for them - perhaps 3-4 months budget or so.

2214~~~
I don't believe I've previously commented on his transfer fee and don't intend to comment about it now. So why try and drag me into this? You'd be better off addressing all those Caftards who were previously busy trying to down-scale the size of Martial's potential fee.

2215~~~
He's been underwhelming so far but he's Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger! We've seen glimpses of his greatness but not enough, for me. Obviously it's just early days but let's hope he kicks on after the international break, starting on Saturday.

2216~~~
Don't care if he cost £15-20m he's awesome and will be our player of the year!

2217~~~
It's a bit daft commenting on the fee of any young player to be honest, considering you're looking at 2 or 3 years down the line before anyone knows whether they'll represent value or not. You're buying them based on something your scouts and other experts have seen. Sometimes they get it right and sometimes they get it wrong. Our experts told the club to make a huge investment in him because they believe he'll come good and that investment was negotiated with a club who also recognised that potential and didn't want to release him. You can laugh about them "taking us for mugs" but in order for them to actually have played a game with us and ripped us off represents a huge gamble as they had to reject all our previous huge bids. I just don't see them turning down a huge offer on the chance that we might come back with a bigger one if they didn't have confidence in him retaining that value.

2218~~~
Come on, you must tell us the true fee.

2219~~~
He'll do great to win that over Mike and Luke

2220~~~
They play Bayernliga. I cannot remember that they did it at Bastian's homeclub (to long ago) but 2 years ago Bayern played a friendly against Müller's homeclub Pähl who build a gym with the money. I guess Pähl would not have the advantage of this FIFA rule anyways (because he will not transfer - and he left too early).

But - when we talk about sources in the media. We always tell you that BILD is pretty relieable when it is about Bayern. They told about the 9 million EUR some weeks ago. They seem to have a source in the office...

2221~~~
Oh shit just saw it on Sky,its official,not sure how they gonna spin this now,bet its red alert in BBC HQ.

2222~~~
"Bumbling Inexperienced Fools Table Insultingly Low Bid To Top Club For Legendary Player"

2223~~~
Been fantastic.

2224~~~
Looks absolutely reinvigorated.

2225~~~
Absolutely brilliant. Not only the coolest, classiest midfielder on the pitch but he's absolutely everywhere - pressing, getting tackles in, pressing more than anyone else. He's a proper 'heart' in the midfield.

2226~~~
An absolute masterclass. Playing a different game to the other 19 outfield players. Man of the match easily.

2227~~~
Top quality today. General.

2228~~~
He's been great, but surely Blind deserves MotM?

2229~~~
Absolute fecking quality. For 9 million he's the bargain of the season so far.

2230~~~
Masterclass.

2231~~~
I love him, such a classy player.

2232~~~
Seems like he's hitting full fitness.

Was a monster. Everywhere on the pitch. BFS playing for United <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2233~~~
Blind was great, but Schweinsteiger was everywhere. I haven't seen a midfield performance like that for us for a few years - since Scholes in his prime.

2234~~~
Starting to look like that Bayern letting him go was not such a smart decision after all. Especially since they play Alonso. Schwein if he stays fit, will end up being the best CM in PL this season.

This was proper box to box stuff, a throw back to how Keane's days. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

2235~~~
Thought he was amazing today. There has been talk about his fitness but he's been absolutely everywhere for 90 mins. Strong in the tackle, chasing every ball down, sometimes even the furthest forward doing it right til the very end. Cool and calm with the ball constantly too no matter what the situation. 

He's an absolute leader.

2236~~~
Was also my MOTM. Was everywhere, technically and positionally impeccable. Tackled, chased, created, what do you want more from a midfielder. Absolute class performance.

2237~~~
Very very close 2nd for MOTM for me, utterly brilliant player. Lasted the whole 90 minutes too <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2238~~~
Absolutely brilliant today. With Blind MOTM for me.

2239~~~
Superb display today. Totally run the midfield

2240~~~
Class as usual. Nothing fazes him.

I would wager he'll be putting in these performances (bad injuries aside) until he's 35. I rank players like him alongside Zidane. Might slow down but even in his mid-late 30s, he'll still be class.

2241~~~
That is what the man is about. I'm so happy to see him strut his stuff at United. Just wish we had got him when Scholes retired.

2242~~~
he looks back to 100% fitness, run till the end, great experienced player, technically brilliant. Bargain of the transfer window.

2243~~~
He plays a different position and game to Alonso. Do not mix this. Alonso right now even plays some kind of libero - and does that great in the matches until now, too. 

He matches better in your system right now than he does at Bayern.

2244~~~
He was wonderful today. He was a step ahead of everyone on the pitch.

2245~~~
Just immense.

Still not sure he and Carrick are an ideal pairing.

2246~~~
Absolutely bossed it when Carrick went off.

2247~~~
In terms of fitness, a huge improvement from before the international break. He was everywhere.

2248~~~
When fit, he's better than any midfielder we have in the squad, no doubt about that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. Sadly it wasn't really our choice. I hope he stays fit, I love watching him play. And he has even more to offer than he did today.

2249~~~
I still think he's playing within himself to some degree. He left almost all of the penetrative passing to Carrick today and in general doesn't pass it forward enough for my liking.

His composure and leadership is just immense though.

2250~~~
Its a fantastic thing having Bastian Schweinsteiger at Man Utd.

2251~~~
Fair point. I guess Martinez replaces Alonso when he is back? Alonso's drop in form last season was too steep and hurt you a lot at the back end.

2252~~~
Germany's finest supreme commander is back.

2253~~~
Best midfielder in the league

2254~~~
Man of the match for me.

2255~~~
A real leader.

2256~~~
Anyone has any stats for distance covered? They never seem to have the ones you'd expect at the top, but this guy pops up absolutely everywhere.

2257~~~
Such a complete player and he is working himself into full fitness. Tireless running even in the last 10 mins.

2258~~~
I was slightly reserved to begin with, although Carrick and BFS were by far the classes midfield Liverpool and A LOT of legs in there, he just took it to another level, wouldn't be suprised to see that he covered more ground than anyone else.

2259~~~
Still think we're not seeing him at his best. He's going to get even better <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2260~~~
Majestic from start to finish and the way he makes so simply is unbelievable

2261~~~
Fantastic performance , after international the  full 90 min  but he look tired less and he can still run at ball like hungry tiger.

2262~~~
Very good game today! Some crucial interceptions and tackling as well. Now that he seems to get fitter, he starts to play better.

2263~~~
Absolute beast today. Love the lad to bits.

2264~~~
Actually gave him my motm which is probably unfair on blind

Just really enjoyed his performance today. Some of my doubts on where he is currently went out the window today (not all, we need hiM all season)

2265~~~
Some players need time to adjust to the physicality of the PL.  BFS seems to relish it.  He was flying in to tackles all over the field and pressing high up the pitch for the full 90.  

Great player, as long as LVG manages his minutes carefully I feel he will be fantastic for us this season and his passing should become more penetrative as he continues to get more comfortable at the club.  A true leader.

2266~~~
Thought he was fantastic today. A proper performance, was everywhere.

2267~~~
Big match won by the ultimate big game midfielder. Class.

2268~~~
Yeah I kinda agree, but Blind was almost flawless at CB, scored the opening goal, and cleared off the line as well. It's close between the two, but Blind was a tiny bit ahead for me.

2269~~~
What a game by him, loved his performance. Long may they continue.

2270~~~
I might be spoiled by the fact that we've seen defensive performances like that quite a lot over the last 4-5 years, due to having the likes of Rio and Vidic at the back. Midfield masterclasses have been much rarer by comparison!

Let's just agree they both were truly exceptional!

2271~~~
Excellent today, looks fit and ready now.

2272~~~
he's still got it. feck me what a performance.

2273~~~
He was brilliant tonight. Top player.

2274~~~
Yeah true, if Basti can keep it up then he'll be a hell of a player for us.

Sounds good to me! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2275~~~
good this this guy

2276~~~
Herrera is someone who must learn from him IMO. He's got similar pressing energy, and can produce moments of class too, but it's the control and channeling of it that he lacks a little. Sometimes he can just be frantic, and I say this as someone who rates Herrera big time.

2277~~~
He was pumped today.

2278~~~
He bossed that midfield today, he took ownership today and was my MOTM.

2279~~~
It's easy for me to say he was great, because Shaw was great too. It'll be difficult to say if he was great or not when one has a good game and one has a bad game. They need different hair.

2280~~~
Neck and neck with Blind for MOTM for me and easily his best game for us so far, absolutely class. He ran all game, used the ball intelligently, protected it supremely, commanded all around him and ran the show. The most exciting thing was seeing him racing back full pelt in the 85th minute, he looked as fit as he has in quite some time.

2281~~~
You can see why the Germans love him. He's taking over responsibility and is helping everyone else on the pitch. A true leader

2282~~~
Where did he suddenly find so much energy from <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2283~~~
Yeah I think so too, he was awesome.

2284~~~
His best match for us and played the entire 90 minutes.  Looked more fit and showed a lot of experience.  He has a very good understanding of when to sit back and when to bomb forward.  Also, on several occasions he just made the center of the field look so comfortable.  Liverpool wanted so much to press us into mistakes but BFS just has such an innate sense of how to turn away from danger and find the right pass.  If he can get one level higher we can compete.

2285~~~
The scary part is that Fußballgott is not even close to 100%, still pretty much building towards optimum form and fitness. Think he'll be immense for us especially in the bigger games (like today), both in Europe and in the league. That's where he was at his best for Bayern for the past decade or so, vs United or Madrid or Barcelona. We've lacked that type of imperious presence in the midfield for a while now. Carrick is brilliant no doubt, but a bit more static and methodical. Bastian on the other hand isn't afraid of getting his hands dirty if it comes to that, to go with his technical ability and passing range. Add that to the obvious leadership ability and calming influence already on display, and he might prove to be one of the most astute signings of the summer window for the entire league.

2286~~~
His name is Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger!

2287~~~
He was our General today. Immense performance.

2288~~~
I thought he was superb today and his energy level was outstanding. We've got some real steel in there with the likes of Schweinsteiger, Shaw, Smalling.

2289~~~
Man of the match for me

2290~~~
My MOTM, he was a complete boss today, invited pressure but never fazed and strong in the air & tackling. 

If I was marking him I'd probably just stand there with my jaw on the floor <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2291~~~
I love this picture that Mata just posted.  You can just see how much Bastien is  in aura at playing for United in Old Trafford.

2292~~~
His performance today will go under the radar because of other things that happened, but I thought that he was fantastic today. He played twice for Germany last week and was up and down today for 94 mins, which was extremely positive considering the question marks over his fitness.

2293~~~
Carrick has given some masterful performances since.

2294~~~
100% agree. I voted him motm as well. Outstanding performance.

2295~~~
Let's see how 'flat' the dressing room is now!

2296~~~
His energy was far better than I imagined I would see. Absolute general in the middle. Bossed the game from start to finish.

2297~~~
Love this man

2298~~~

2299~~~
Class, leadership and drive the things we lacked in midfield over the last few years. He is the personification of Midfield General.

2300~~~
For someone who "hasn't been fit for years", he ran his bollocks of. Immense pressing at times. 

Fantastic game.

2301~~~
What a lucky bastard having his brother playing for the club he loves so he gets great tickets and to walk on that pitch under lights! 

I'm starting to think Basti is as much as an United fan as his brother but is protecting his image at Bayern by not saying he's loved them all along <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2302~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's great

2303~~~
Doesn't Felix have to exercise for the winter competitions. I want to see him ahead of Hirscher. (nobody knows who you are in England anyways...) 
And why does the U17 not play this weekend.

I have to say that this two guys for sure look better in Bayern kits... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2304~~~
Best United performance today by a mile, after watching him midweek for Germany I thought he would be 'rested' today, (LVG knows best !) he looked like he had a real hunger and really stepped up his game, only regret is that we never signed him when Keano retired !

2305~~~
Breathtaking. Need a gift of that backheel flick in the second.

2306~~~
Schweinsteiger is built for games like today (how ruddy good was he in the World Cup Final?!), if he stays healthy he will be an absolute bargain.

2307~~~
Controlling midfield performance.

2308~~~
Thought he was fantastic today, and you can tell he's getting back to his full fitness. On the ball, I never had any doubts. I mean, he's proven that. Off the ball; however, in previous games, he's looked a bit leggy. He was everywhere today. Great performance.

2309~~~
Ana Ivanovic was also in Manchester today, surprised that there haven't been any pics.

2310~~~
Thats why he ran his socks off

2311~~~
He was brilliant. He just knows how to play football. 

I keep thinking he's Shaw though

2312~~~
Neureuther probably knows it's pretty pointless trying that so he rather watches United <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2313~~~
yep, me too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2314~~~
Same here. Both have blond hair, both run in an upright posture.

2315~~~
Both have yellow boots, too.

2316~~~
ha, made the same post in the matchday thread.

2317~~~
Guys, I think both have yellow boots which might also be a reason we keep mistaking the two of them.

2318~~~
An absolute boss. The player I have always wanted and dreamt of at United, and he's here now, amazing.

2319~~~
Both are fecking awesome, too.

2320~~~
Class.

2321~~~
Keane-esque.

2322~~~
He's had great peformances, but he's never had the complete performance I saw today. Movement, stamina, control, intelligence, quick thinking, leadership... Today is as complete a midfield performance as I've seen in years.

2323~~~
My favorite non-united player atm is Tobi Schweinsteiger

2324~~~
Don't get me wrong Schwein's performance was great, but you're doing an injustice to Carrick. He held our midfield for years, and, in my opinion, is the best holding midfielder in the world.

Some of Carrick's games over the last years have been sublime.

2325~~~
Partly agreed, don't think he's the best holding mid but he's very good. While watching football matches, we tend to prioritise tenacity and tackles over passes and awareness which is perhaps why we tend to see a lot of Smalling and Bastian over Blind and Carrick but Carrick has been our only mid ever since Scholes retired prior to this season.

2326~~~

Just got a nagging feeling that we'll win the CL whilst he's here.

2329~~~
"Do you use contacts? I use contacts. Here, you can see it if you look closely"

2330~~~
That was such a joy to watch. He bossed the MF. Him and Carrick together looked fantastic.

2331~~~
I'll eat the crow, he has been more than solid for us so far.

2332~~~
Big game player.

There are no words to describe how much I love this guy. I still can't believe he plays for us! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2333~~~
Impossible to tell him and Shaw apart. Have to look out for the number.

2334~~~
They're different players to be honest. Carrick is the Busquets to Schweinsteiger's Keane. My preference will always be the latter. A player who doesn't just lead by ability,  but leads with personality as well.

2335~~~
He was fantastic today, he's such a pro. He's been there and done that and it's really reassuring. Loved seeing him chasing runners in the 85th minute after starting the game. He's so valuable to our squad.

2336~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

What a match, feels so different now knowing we have a midfielder who is going to impose himself on every big game we are going to play!! Hope some of the people who were worried about buying are seeing why so many of us were excited when he signed for us.. The back  flick near the end was awesome,love his confidence..

2337~~~
I know! Their height, hair and shirts are so alike.

If you want to tell the difference, look at the arms. Schweinsteiger keeps them  a bit more lifted and curled, while Shaws are pretty straight down.

2338~~~
€6m <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2339~~~
It was £6.5m wasn't it?

2340~~~
My MOM

2341~~~
Still a ridiculous fee for the quality of the player.

2342~~~
Absolute pleasure watching him in that game. It was nothing to him, just so easy and to do it in a game like that (not that it was a high tempo game) just makes it even better. Like everyone else, just find myself laughing at the price now.

We do have to manage him though, can't become reliant on him.

2343~~~
That player just looks United..  MotM..  Blind and Shaw aswell but shit is he good.  Love him. Mein hauptmittelfeldmeister..

2344~~~
don't spoil it

2345~~~
For me, the first match he's put in a world class performance. It all just looks routine to him, almost a walk in the park against this league.

2346~~~
There was a point in the first half where he was the only one pressuring Liverpool players (he pressed like three including the keeper) which resulted in Liverpool being frantic at the back. If he had two more players pressing with him, I have no doubt we would have made more of it.

A superb player, privilege to watch him play.

2347~~~
When he could have had a free right after the third goal, jumped straight back up, raced back and won back possession...delightful! What a player

2348~~~
Closest thing to Keane out there

2349~~~
He's brilliant. Strange that he came to United which is in a bit of a puzzle over Bayern who are completely dominant.

He has such intelligence and command over the field. Rooney should do the decent thing and give him captaincy! World Cup winning midfield general <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2350~~~
The sooner he retires from the national team and we make him captain the better imo.

2351~~~
I thought he was brilliant today. Not always flashy, but so clever and commanding. A real leader, which perhaps is to be expected. He's a great passer of the ball, and clearly loves a tackle now and again. He makes the players around him better. I was also impressed with how well he got around the park today. A short term asset, but a fantastic acquisition!

2352~~~
He will not. Especially not now when he is all year in England. And he does not have kids like e.g. Lahm or Mertesacker who just do not want to spend another 6 to 8 weeks a year away from home. The national team is like coming home.

2353~~~
Clearly doesn't have the legs to be all action anymore but still brilliant

2354~~~
Let's be honest, even though he does not have the captains armband he is pretty much the captain, the one that every player will look up to and when he points or speaks on the pitch, no one will dare to question him. He's just one of those immense character every football team needs to be great.

Won't get the headlines much but the fans will always just be in awe as will the players. Just can't believe he is playing for us

2355~~~
What a composed performance. Feels so relaxed as a fan to have him, Carrick and Schneiderlin in that midfield. 

Controlled the game with such ease. He is getting back into his Bayern form.

2356~~~
May be after the Euros then?

2357~~~
He's got one more World Cup win in him <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. Can't let him retire from the nationalteam before that.

2358~~~
Germany has some great prospect in midfield though with Kramer, Gundogan and others. Also Kroos and Khedira are much younger than him. Hopefully he would be forced to cede his starting position and that might make him retire. But perhaps that is wishful thinking. Jogi Low is unlikely to drop one of his stellar performers as long as he's at the helm. Is he going to be there after the Euros or is it his last tournament as manager of Germany?

2359~~~
I don't think he ever said anything about when he wants to retire from the nationalteam. He's clearly very excited about being captain now and talked a lot about his desire to win more. I'd be surprised if he retired after the Euros if he's still healthy and a regular starter. And I can't see him being replaced in the team as long as he plays on such a high level. It might change, if he becomes a father in the near future and wants to spend more time with his family. But as long as Ana Ivanovic is his girlsfriend and travelling around the world all summer long anyway, why should he sit alone at home instead of playing football for Germany?

2360~~~
I think you misunderstood me. What I meant to ask was about Jogi Low, who'd perhaps never drop him but with a new manager you never know. I don't expect him to retire right after Euros. He has a three year contract here and there's a WC right after that. He obviously backs himself to be good enough player till then to play for both Man United and for Germany NT.

2361~~~
Great to see him racking up the minutes again as well as for Germany last week. His performance was exactly what you expect from a controlling midfield general! It's so exciting for us to have him and the scary thought for other teams is he will only get better each game!

I'm so happy Reds <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2362~~~
Oh you asked if Löw might retire after the Euro? No idea to be honest. The contract doesn't matter all that much. If he wants to do something else after the Euro, the German FA would let him go, no doubt about that. But he seems really happy in the job, I expect him to stay at least until 2018.

Difficult to say who could maybe replace Löw and if that new manager might prefer a younger midfield combination without Schweinsteiger.

2363~~~
He's been named fussballgot for a reason. He was incredible today. Even in the first half, he tried some flicks for Herrera and Depay to run into, which were not picked up by the team. That understanding will come and he must have incredible pass completion stats. He always wriggles out of tight corners and seems to know when to press and when to drop back. He has been doing these things little things that are only noticeable if you watch him closely. Stands out if you watch the game again. 

Playing midweek for Germany and another 90 minutes here, I'm wondering if Van Gaal would rest him on Tuesday against PSV.

2364~~~
I just hope people don't climb on his back when he is injured or he has to manage game time by playing 60 minutes a match.

2367~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2368~~~
Didn't he play 90 mins for Germany during the week? If so then his fitness has come on leaps and bounds.

2369~~~
One word: Majestic

He looked unfit the first couple of games, but was immense today. I still can't believe we got Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger for 6,5m. Thank you Bayern <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2370~~~
I love how he can use his left foot and when in a difficulty position to still pick out a great pass like it was nothing. Being good on your weak foot like that is a huge advantage if you couple it with a great footballing brain, it opens up so many passing possibilities. The way he keeps his composure under pressure is what has impressed me the most about him.

2371~~~
<i>"If you don't hit the back of the net, my fist will hit you here!"</i>

2372~~~
I've been so so impressed with him so far. To be honest, I thought we had another Carrick on our hands after watching him build his fitness in preseason and the early games (that's a positive comment btw). I thought it had probably been agreed between him and Van Gaal that he'd opt to play a slower game and use Schneiderlin's legs next to him for longevity.

I couldn't believe my eyes last night when he was still charging around at full pace and blasting forward to join/carry the attacks so late in the game.

He looks incredibly fit again and the internationals probably helped with that. He's always had a fantastic engine so why should that change at 31?

Then you get on to the personality side of things and he's just fantastic again. The way he marshals the troops around him, the way he singles out the younger players during a break in play and has a little chat. He's like Roy Keane on Prozac.

2373~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2374~~~
This is the sort of player we have been missing and that Liverpool now lack, an experienced player who's seen it all.

2375~~~
He ran like a madman yesterday, he chased everything.

2376~~~
Two weeks of training with his national team and he comes back looking in shape and fit. 

What has our training regime been doing wrong?

2377~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2378~~~
Excellent and he loved playing yesterday.

2379~~~
Incredible yesterday, any other day he'd have been motm for that performance.

2380~~~
Incredible energy levels considering his international exploits... great performance overall.

2381~~~
Does anyone have a gif of his ribery turn pass he done near the end of the game and megged someone with it.. sure I didn't imagine it.

2382~~~
loved his one man pressure in the first half where he went all the way to the gk, we need a gif of that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2383~~~
That trick from darmian is getting popular. But you use that on the opposition basti

2384~~~
I love how he cradles the ball so effectively. He's hard to tackle and rarely loses the ball on a pass. He's so reliable it's just great having him here. Also amazing how much energy he had yesterday.

2385~~~
Quote of the day <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2386~~~
Midfield general. 

If only we had got him a few years earlier

2387~~~
Scholes played til he was 38. Bastian has only just turned 31! We have a good few years of this born leader yet <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Was excellent yesterday, 106 touches and he went after the ball a lot which was great. I couldn't believe it was him when the forwards should've been chasing the ball up front.

2389~~~
they energetic performance from him yesterday, was shocked, completely different to the sluggish player we've seen so far this season and a lot of last season for Bayern.

Not convinced him and carrick together is a good idea mind, but yesterday Schweinsteiger defiantly started to win me over.

2390~~~
Feck me he's good. He's absurdly good.

2391~~~
Fantastic yesterday, was a real joy to watch.

I just hope we win something while he is with us.

2392~~~
Agree with those saying he was MOTM.

Looked a class above everyone else on the pitch for me.

Didn't understand the scepticism over his signing in the first place since alll he had to do was basicallly get himself half fit and he'd have been a significant step up from what we had in that area of the pitch last season (i.e. no one)....but looks like he still has some hunger to go with the ability as well which is a big bonus.

2393~~~

2394~~~
So Milner for free or Bastian for 6m? Gotta love the scousers' optimism.

2395~~~
Do Bayern have any more over the hill crocks for £6m?

2396~~~
Deary me. I thought Bastian was coming here to enjoy an early retirement. And I knew the guy could play, but oh my God, now I really know the guy can play.

There were some good performances against Liverpool, but in my opinion Schweini was the pick of the bunch. He was having one of those 'God mode' days, where he just looked head and shoulders above everyone else. Great to see him last 90 minutes, and he was closing people down and chasing lost causes from the first minute until the last. His intelligence on and off the ball made him look like a teacher on a field full of students.

Long story short, I've now realised what a massive addition he is to our side. Can't wait to see him boss Champions League games.

2397~~~
Immense. Absolutely immense. 

Has that quality of always seeming to know who is where when he receives the ball and that ability to instantly make space for himself. I couldn't remotely understand anyone being underwhelmed by his arrival with us he could end up being player of the season.

2398~~~
And it's time to realize that he'll be at this level for 3-4 seasons easily, top class midfielders have very good longevity and I can't see him going poor before 34-35 at all. When you look at the likes of Xavi and Pirlo they were still great at 35 and Scholes was very good even at 37-38.

2399~~~
Reminds me of Van Persie who played with a similar determination during his first season. Here's hoping Schweini can stay relevant for more than a year and a half.

Looks at some of those GIFs.

2401~~~
I guess his qualities as footballer have never been doubted by anyone. Really hope he can keep this level of fitness then he will turn out to be a bargain.

2402~~~
Good performance from him, especially physically. But there is still a lot to come from him.

2403~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/6550212/Bastian-Schweinsteiger-in-bizarre-love-triangle.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepag...-Schweinsteiger-in-bizarre-love-triangle.html</a>

He has good taste in women

2404~~~
glad to see so many people happy with his performance. It is one of those phenomena that make football such an interesting sport:  Obviously a player can be good/fit/fast enough to wipe the floor wih the likes of Real, City, Barca or BVB, even with the brazilian or argentinian team, but stil be too slow/fat for the mighty Watford or Crystal Palace. Of course, he is only worth 66% of Dante, so there's always that.

2405~~~
That slide tackle <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2406~~~
The article tries to paint this bad boy image of him. But even in his early Schweini days he wasn't that bad. Eventually he publicly anounced that he wants to grow up "from Schweini to Bastian Schweinsteiger" and not be treated like a kid anymore. He definitely seems to be a very mature guy now. I mean who isn't a bit bad when he's 18-25?

2407~~~
I wish he is just 25

Let's enjoy him while he's here

2408~~~
Couldn't agree more. Scholes was his age in 2006 (I believe?) and look at what he did beyond that.

Schweinsteiger will be great until 34/35 easily.

2409~~~
It has to be noted, though, that schwiensteigher isn't <i>that</i> level of playmaker as Scholes and Pirlo were. He's more well rounded and all action and those midfielders possibly have a lower shelf life. He's been better and more classy than Vidal but just to use an example, I'd expect Vidal to not last as long as busquets at the highest level.

Then again, given that he's not one dimensional and has always been classy on the ball too, he may as well do it.

2410~~~
I do know what you mean but even when he was plodding around against Liverpool his composure and passing was excellent. I can't remember which Liverpool players they were but a couple of them got made to look like fools in the second half at times and he wasn't even displaying much 'trickery' when doing so. Even without the 'all-action' tackles and drives with the ball, he still brings a hell of a lot to the table for me.

2411~~~
Aye, same goes to Carrick.

2412~~~
Yeah that's why I added the last bit.

He is complete. Neither an absolute playmaking genius nor largely about tackling, tenacity and running, but somewhere in between.

2413~~~
He was able to convert from wing to central midfield when he was younger and less experienced, with his passing range he will have absolutely no trouble adapting his game to perform a different role to the one he had at Bayern.

2414~~~
Did they all wait in the tunnel since he was ready getting his hair in shape - and then he passed them and went on the pitch first? <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/> (I do not know him like this. At Bayern or the national team they always have to wait in the tunnel until he arrives but they never let him pass to go on the pitch first...) 

No. Schweinsteiger is not really a playmaker. I always like to descripe him as the complete midfield allrounder. There are better players in passing, tackling, build-up, attacking or defending, more pressing resistant players, players with better heading abilities... But he has from everything enough. What I like about him is that he can speed up a match when needed - and slow it down when the team is nervous.

2415~~~
Wilson is still there i see

2416~~~
I thought he did very well considering he was on his own. 

That pass to Mata was brilliant.

2417~~~
I thought he was our best player tonight. Picked out a couple of sublime balls that we should have converted into goals.

2418~~~
Another good performance from him. Beautiful pass to Mata who ended up fecking it up.

2419~~~
Yeah was a lovely pass. Should have lead to an easy tap.

2420~~~
He is fit no doubt, good times.

2421~~~
He's looking pretty fit now, would be fantastic if he started all our games from now on.

2422~~~
I wish he would stay central and build up our play on a regular basis. Team should play more to his strengths as well

2423~~~
His defensive screening is not good as Carricks to play the sole DM.

Also tires out towards the end of each half. Anyone else noticed that ?

2424~~~
Initially I was quite critical of his performance but I missed the Mata chance he created.  It hasn't quite worked out as well for him as he probably thought. Be good to see him play more regularly though.

2425~~~
Was good but looked on his own at times. Just cannot understand why Schneiderlin or Carrick didn't get a look in.

2426~~~
Had another good game, I don't think Herrera is the right partnership with him though.

2427~~~
I agree with this. But he offers more in an offensive threat.

2428~~~
Apart from his superb pass to Mata, I thought he was ordinary, with some very poor passes and one careless moment that gave them a chance on the counter-attack which I think De Gea saved or it went wide, can't remember.

2429~~~

2430~~~
Really seemed to be lacking support around him, especially noticeable when he took an eternity to pick a pass around the halfway line.

I don't think the partnership with Herrera is going to work.

2431~~~
One decent pass into Mata but overall slow.

2432~~~
Pretty sure you mean Mata there. And Schweinsteiger was nowhere near ordinary.

2433~~~
It's our most attacking partnership, so I hope to see more of it, doesn't work, when the #10 to link up with is utter terrible though.

2434~~~
He was good, controlled the game, would like to see Schneiderlin paired up with him so he has more freedom to go forward, he's great at picking out passes behind the opo defence and is capable of scoring too.

2435~~~
The problem yesterday was, as he was dictating the game, and screening, he wasn't available to drive the game forward too, which Herrera couldn't manage. 

I was shocked we didn't play Schneiderlin with him, of course Carrick needed the break.

2436~~~
That is quite something <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> 
Thought he had an OK game, very much trying to encourage and drive on our players, some sloppy moments as well.

2437~~~
There's a point in the game when Martial pressured the PSV keeper into a rushed low clearance and it went right to him. The keeper was way out of his goal and I thought he'd try and score from distance but he didn't.

2438~~~
Welcome to Manchester! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2439~~~
I remember that chance. I could understand if he didn't want to risk it because there were two or three players getting into position. Risk is not something that's allowed in LvG's system unless you're one of the front four, after all.

2440~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love how each and every thing gets twisted to somehow blame van Gaal and his system.

2441~~~
I had a choice between criticizing BFS and LvG... I took the easier route <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2442~~~
Atleast you admit it. Fair dos

2443~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2444~~~
On at half time surely?

Not sure why he didn't start

2445~~~
Can't play every game, he's not that fit.

2446~~~
We need him to give us some drive on midfield, it's way too safe in there right now.

2447~~~
Have to rotate him and manage his minutes.

2448~~~
He looked knakeredfor the last 15 mins against PSV. Doubt he could start 3 games in 8 days. Hopefully will come on for 45 mins though.

2449~~~
He's so calm, still can't believe he's playing for us!

2450~~~
What an impact he had on the game when coming on. Instant change and we completely dominated (until the last 5 basically when they scored).

2451~~~
Best CM in the Prem IMO. He's still got it and he makes our midfield tick. When he came on, we completely dominated the midfield.

2452~~~
Best player we've got. Absolute class.

2453~~~
Class.

2454~~~
It's basically cheating to be able to bring him on with 30 minutes to spare. Especially for £6m. FIFA need to look into that one.

2455~~~
Cheaper than Bebe. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2456~~~
Fast becoming my favourite player. If only he was a couple years younger. He is the man.

2457~~~
He is brilliant. Nothing more to say.

Got to love his chant too.

2458~~~
Was brilliant when he came on. Needs to start every game, although it's not exactly possible.

2459~~~
Best deal of the summer. He's just too good.

He always seems to recover from misjudgements. There was one moment right on the half way line where he seemed to misjudge how close the opposing player was. It looked certain he was going to lose the ball, but he just body checks the lad to the ground with his hip, and we keep the ball. I think I cheered that louder than I cheered any of the goals.

2460~~~
Helped us a lot. Absolutely controlled the game. What a fecking player. 

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2461~~~
He is looking far better than I was expecting


I did doubt this deal

Lvg handling him extremely well too. Even when on the bench he is an amazing option to bring on and always makes an almost instant impression

2462~~~
Just pure class.

2463~~~
That little pass into Memphis' shot that hit the post is a pass that basically nobody in our squad would make... Just such a smart player and knows how to find players and adds that bit of creativity and vision from midfield that we don't have all the time. Different class.

2464~~~
Same here. I thought LVG would only play him in Europe for his experience when he wanted a 5 man midfield. Proved me wrong.

2465~~~
Completely changed the game when he came on. £6 million. What a bargain. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2466~~~
The panic in here when it looked like we were signing him over Schneiderlin. Schneiderlin is a very good player, but BFS is easily one of the best CMs in the last decade.

2467~~~
Take that fecking armband of Rooney asap and get it on the only boss on the pitch..  BfS best signing of the summer...

2468~~~
He Germaned the shit out of the game when he came on.

2469~~~
He's fecking amazing. Every touch and economy of movement is class.

2470~~~
This.

His attitude is phenomenal, I enjoy watching him play. Even when he is poor his attitude and character is always positive.

2471~~~
The Captain.

2472~~~
Wish we had got him when he was 25. What a master he is. I hope we can get atleast 2 good years out of him.

2473~~~
He really is good!

2474~~~
He's so much better than I thought he would be. I knew when he played he'd do well but I didn't expect him to play this much or be this dominant. As long as we keep managing his playing time well he'll have a huge impact on our season. We look like a different team when he's playing.

2475~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I love that term.

2476~~~
Loved the fans singing his German chant today!

2477~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2478~~~
To me his pass was the key to our Barcelona-quese third goal. (His pass and Memphis' firsts touch, of course.) 88% passes succesfull. Pretty good match.

2479~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.. That's so fecking true.

2480~~~
He's fantastic isn't he. So much quality. What we've been missing in midfield for years. Pity he's not 25.

2481~~~
Boss!

2482~~~
He's the leader on the pitch that we've been missing for some years. Love to see him get the armband.

2483~~~
He is such a joy to watch.

That little acceleration and pass to Depay is such a small thing but it exactly what separates him from the rest and makes nice keep ball into brilliant football.

2484~~~
I don't think we've had a player recently who can get so much done with so little effort.  Maybe Carrick, but I think BS wins that comparison.

I also think he needs to be considered for the captaincy. Rooney at the rate he's going might feature less and less and BS is the ideal leader to have.

2485~~~
He deserves a title*. Just hope we can get him one. 

*And i don't mean Lord Bastian. Ahh feck it, yes i do.

2486~~~
World class gonna world class.

2487~~~
It's got to be him and Carrick starting

2488~~~
He's just too good.  Pass and move master.

2489~~~
Very comforting having him on the field. Honestly feel we are in good hands with the three CMs but he just oozes class.

2490~~~
Fantastic player. If its true we paid less than£10m then that is hard to believe and must go down as  one of the  best £10 milliions this club has ever spent. I know hes only really played in fits and starts but his energy levels look really good  and he covers the  ground so quickly for such a  powerfully built player. you can see why van gaal  loves him though because when we are up and in  control  everything goes through him and his control  of the tempo of a game must be  among the best that's ever been.

2491~~~
Just needs to stay fit. But when he's like this, he's the best midfielder in the league (Toure up there with him when Toure is on the form he's been for the start of this season). But they're both a class above the rest. Fabregas and others a level below. Just oozes intelligence and composure when he's on the pitch. Felt we shouldn't have started him against PSV as so many games back to back will inevitably tire him out, and he wasn't at his best in the second half against PSV because of that. Didn't help that he played every minute for both games for Germany during the international break, then ran around non-stop against Liverpool. Anybody would be knackered. 

Having him subbed on just makes me so comfortable and confident that we'll see the game out though. He just knows where to pass it at all times.

2492~~~
This. he makes wise choices all the time. I can't believe how ordinary he makes everybody else look.

2493~~~
It's even less than that. £6-7m is the reported fee by BILD and if that's the case, then it's one of the bargains of the last decade.

2494~~~
He's the God of football.

2495~~~
Yeah, he's our best midfielder. An absolute joy to watch. 

Any concerns I had have been pretty much put to bed. Just wish we got him when he was 25!

2496~~~
The best thing Van Gaal has done.

2497~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Midfield authority

2498~~~
Can't get enough of watching him play. What an influential midfielder he is. Perfect for us and looks to be a ridiculously good signing.

2499~~~
He cost the same amount as Bebe. Let that sink in for a moment.

2500~~~
Him and Carrick should be starting our home games.

2501~~~
Why does anybody doubt the sum?

Actually the 9m EUR were varified by his youth club on their homepage who got some ten thousand EURs from that sum because of FIFA laws. So it is not even speculation of the media anymore... 

And I am pretty sure that Bastian let's you bleed with his wage... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2502~~~
we paid 40m player less then 10m, its simple as that.

2503~~~
Didn't know that, thought it just the BILD info (though very reliable when it comes to Bayern). Cheers man.

2504~~~
Merson said he would flop. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2505~~~
Still have to pinch yourself when you see him out there. Class again.

2506~~~
There's no bleeding. The club is loaded. Would be like you throwing a coin down the wishing well.

2507~~~
But he's old and past it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2508~~~
The money for sure will be better spent than the money you threw out for Falcao or di Maria... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

But he should stay away from the crisps...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlObw5L_aX4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2509~~~
Yep, it still feels so weird that he plays for us. 

Really hitting form now. Van Gaal deserves credit for how he's managed him so far too.

2510~~~
Just get the feeling that OT will explode if he sticks one in at home. A winner against City would make it worth triple whatever we paid.

2511~~~
MOTD2 had a nice bit highlighting how he knitted the 45-pass goal together.

Wait, which chant is this?

2512~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jw3_OpGpY1g?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Really gets going about 50 seconds in

2513~~~
Ah, thanks. Great atmosphere there.

I also really like how he hesitates between "football" and "Fussball" at the beginning, and then decides, nah, "football" sounds much better. He slips back into "Fussball" once later on but quickly corrects himself.

2514~~~
Catchy tune. What are the words?

2515~~~
Deutsche Fussballmeister
Deutsche Fussballmeister
Deutsche Fussballmeister, Bastian

Bayern fans chanted the same thing (shown below), but with FCB (FC Bayern) at the end instead of Bastian.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbHF_Zi2Dzw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2516~~~
anyone got a video of this?

2517~~~
This!! Absolutely do not believe it that he is playing for us. Calm and composed. Two words I will use in all my posts related to him. He really knows how to control his game. I am really hoping he can stay fit and become our Pirlo playing past 35-36

2518~~~
he is getting there. such a world class.

the key is how to manage him and carrick and fit them in for the team. how strong our midfield look today as compared to the last few years..

2519~~~
Wages cost money too. It's a two-step purchase. 

But anyway.. He's <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Still hard to believe he's a Manchester United player.

2520~~~
The way he strolls through games he can play like this until he's 40.

2521~~~
It's there in the 45 pass goal thread.

2522~~~
Hopefully no need for him vs Ipswich and so he can get a nice full week rest

2523~~~
Still think him paired with Schneiderlin are our best midfield duo at the moment.

2524~~~
Basti at 100% is the best CM in the league. Can't understand why Bayern didn't seem fussed about letting him go.

2525~~~
I hope Herrera is shadowing him very closely in training and the matches as well. He won't get a better live example to mould himself on.

2526~~~
Left and right foot too. He already knows how to position his body in order to make the intended pass. There aren't many CMs who have this great ability and seeing that one of them play for us is just great.

2527~~~
He wanted to go to experience something new and, given the fact that he had given them 10+ years of service, they respected his wish.

2528~~~
Love him. He does the simple things well and reads the game brilliantly. There's a lot of hard work goes into making it look so easy.

2529~~~
Well yeah, but it's still fecking weird that his transfer fee is the same as Bebe's. He's one of the best midfielders in the last decade and he cost the same amount as Bebe. It's fecking insane.

2530~~~
Must admit when we made this deal I was very sceptical but he has proven so far to be a fantastic signing. I really wish we got him 2-3 years ago.

2531~~~
Weren't they also a bit concerned about his recent injury record?

2532~~~
On the ball, he just seems better and calmer than most of our other players.

2533~~~
Such a subtle player. Love him.

2534~~~
Yeh I was sceptical because of fitness. Seems we've managed him perfectly so far!

2535~~~
Yes. And given his injury record in the past two years at Bayern those concerns weren't entirely unjustified (fully fit he's, well, Schweini though). The main reason was still to fulfill his wishes, imo.

2536~~~
I'm glad, decent of them.

2537~~~
thank god we have this guy for the champions league.

2538~~~
Yeah, like the way we let Butt / P.Nev go for nominal fees as a reward for their long service.  I know, not a direct comparison - but you know what I mean!!

2539~~~
So what you're saying is Nicky Butt is about the same level of player as Bastain Schweinsteiger?

Wow, pretty controversial I have to say.

2540~~~
Are you really suggesting that Phil Neville was about the same level as Schweinsteiger at his best? Wow...

<span style="color: #ffffff">Hheheheheheheh </span>

2541~~~
He just oozes quality and authority. He should start every week if fit and available without a shadow of a doubt.

2542~~~
I know, awful comment.


Like he even compares to Fizzer....

2543~~~
I knew the white text was there! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2544~~~
He's our best midfielder by a mile. The difference when he came on for Carrick was night and day. Carrick is obviously a v good player but his partnership with Schneiderlin lacks any kind of movement and our midfield becomes rooted in front of our CB's. Schweini just took control and made the team flow as soon as he came on and that was our best period of the game. The way he reads the game is like he has a computer in is head it's just amazing to watch. He sees situations before anyone else and that brings a calmness to his teammates.

2545~~~
Martin Koewn (I know!) made a great comment about him yesterday, he says the difference between him and Carrick is that he actually runs with the ball, which attracts oppostion players to him thus creating space for others, whereas Carrick is the opposite and prefers to pass the ball first rather then running with it.

I'd like to see him paried with Carrick and Scheinderlin, with Memphis, Matrial and Rooney upfront. That would be quite a good line up!

2546~~~
Pass, move and direct. That's all he does all match long. Nearly impossible to mark, you will lose team shape following this guy around.

2547~~~
We now finally have a replacement for Scholes,  Bastian is amazing

2548~~~
Agreed. They offer the perfect balance for each other.

2549~~~
But guys, he's not even as good as Phil Neville and Nicky Butt... no idea what you're all getting excited about.

2550~~~
If we can get him fit enough to continue playing into his mid 30s, he'll be one of the best buys we've ever had.

2551~~~
Fixed.

2552~~~
Bastian f*ckin Schweinsteiger.

I feel thats needed on every page. Still so happy hes a United player <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Important signing, last season showed how poor our midfield is without Carrick. Now being able to rotate the two keeps control for the majority of the game for us.

2553~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RM0kiAA72II?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2554~~~
Bastian can do what Carrick does but Carrick cannot do what Bastian does.

2555~~~
I think that's a very limited way of looking at it. They're different players.

2556~~~
Of course it's limited, it's one sentence.

2557~~~
I demand an essay on the matter right now.

I'm with Gerrard in Istanbul by the way... very different players, and I not sure Bastian can do some of the defensive things as well as Carrick

2558~~~
Put Bastian down in that Lone Holding midfield spot behind two CM's and you would see that Bastian can't do what Carrick does.

2559~~~
Why would he struggle? It's pretty much what he's playing damn great for Germany for years now.

2560~~~
He plays for Manchester United

2561~~~
I didn't say he would struggle, what i meant was that he isn't at the same level as Carrick when it comes to dictating from deep.
Schweini is the better overall player though.

2562~~~
What a player.

2563~~~
Fair enough, still don't agree. Schweini never really played a classic box to box role next to a deeper sitting partner. He always did the build-up from deep, often dropped between the centerbacks and I don't see how Carrick has done that better than him. Schweinsteiger was clearly the deeper playing midfielder next to van Bommel/Khedira/Kroos. Even next to Gustavo and Martinez he was usually behind them in the build-up. He offers more going forward, is more mobile and physical than Carrick, so a more disciplined partner like Martinez gave him an even better platform to shine and influence the game all over the pitch as it was next to gung-ho, headless chicken Khedira or in a 3 man midfield with Kroos and Özil.

But Schweinsteiger's prefered and best role clearly is one where he has the whole game in front of him and he's the one dictating the play between defense and attack. It was one of the reasons why he never found his place at Bayern last season. He came into the team after a long injury break and Alonso had that role, who is incredibly dominant on the ball himself, needs the game running through him. Carrick is quite happy to share that area or play 2nd fiddle in the build-up, just like he did next to Scholes. That's why Schweinsteiger and Carrick together can work. Schweini + Alonso on the other hand was a clusterfeck, way too similar in how they want to play the game.

So I really think that:
is a pretty accurate description. And that's no slight on Carrick at all, he has been fantastic in his role. But Bastian can play the disciplined deep role just as good and additionally offers even more.

2564~~~
He is just wonderful. Still surreal to see him on the pitch, wearing our red shirt <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2565~~~
I couldn't have explained it better <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a>.

2566~~~
Didn't realise how underrated this guy was till he joined us. People really think Carrick is better at dictating play?

2567~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2568~~~
I love occasionally popping into this thread to have a quick wank

2569~~~
Did awesome work against Southampton especially during the 45 touch goal. Really masters the midfield, our midfield general.

2570~~~
I think it's less that he was underrated, and more that people were worried about whether he was getting too old to be a success for us, and whether his fitness was a problem. He's widely been recognised as one of the best midfielder's around over the past 5 years or so.

2571~~~
watching the 45 pass goal again, whilst the rest was just playing keep-ball he was playing chess.

2572~~~
At the risk of sounding stupid, during that 45 pass goal he seemed to just waive his arms around and point a lot but it don't seem to have any connection to where the ball went. He did without doubt make the key pass, but are we nevertheless in danger of granting him supernatural powers based solely on his reputation?

2573~~~
Likewise. The closest thing we have to the fantastic Bastian-Martinez midfield that did so well in Europe.

2574~~~
What danger ? What we say as fans on these boards have zero impact on what happens on the pitch ?

2575~~~
maybe its just a nervous twitch or summat. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2576~~~
Just an expression. But I like to think the collective view of fans has quite a big impact on the club. Maybe we could hire a plane to fly over Old Trafford with a tickertape banner saying "BSF - not as influential as sometimes thought." I'm in for a fiver.

2577~~~
Is he still planning to take the team over to Munich for the Oktoberfest?

2578~~~
There is a good and detailed interview with him in the German newspaper Zeit.
I link it for whoever can read german: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zeit.de/2015/38/bastian-schweinsteiger-manchester-rio-finale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zeit.de/2015/38/bastian-schweinsteiger-manchester-rio-finale</a>
He was nervous before his first match at OT because he had fouled Rooney last year when he got sent off and didn't know if the fans would still hold that against him. Well he's definitely not reading redcafe<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2579~~~
That is "standard mode" for him. You'll know he means business when he starts holding one arm across his chest, Beckenbauer-WC70-like.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.futbolsapiens.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011.08.15-franzbecenbahuer.jpg" src="http://img.futbolsapiens.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011.08.15-franzbecenbahuer.jpg"/>

2580~~~
I think most would have took his side over Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2581~~~
Doesn't Carrick have a larger passing range though? I haven't seen Schweinsteiger pinging passes diagonally across the pitch at United like Carrick often does for us. No slight on Schweinsteiger, but I don't agree that's he's just Carrick+. Different players, with different strengths, and Schweiny the better overall.

2582~~~
He, along with Rooney and Mata, touched the ball more then anyone else in that move.

Also, It's not just "waving his arms and pointing" it's being vocal and communicating with your team. Letting the man on the ball no where his options are - which is just good team play really. Sometimes the ball did go where he was pointing, most often it didn't... but who cares? It's just good team play.

2583~~~
Don't think so. I haven't seen too many United games this season, so can't really comment on that. But Schweinsteiger played wonderful long passes to Ribery and Robben countless times. Attacking down the wings has been our biggest weapon since 2009 after all and Schweinsteiger was often the heart of the transition, from deep forward or from one wing to the other.

2584~~~
Well it does rather suggest his influence is not as great as sometimes suggested based on the noise he makes. Not that I'm dissing him - he's obviously a very good player. I like the way he can pass and move at the same time, which seems to be something Carrick finds difficult.

2585~~~
I also remember seeing him do this countless times for both Bayern and Germany. 

He doesn't seem to do it much for us though. Maybe it's just a matter of instructions from van Gaal; keep it tidy.

2586~~~
He is probably our most important signing this season (although its difficult to pick one tbh). Not just in terms of contribution only but also having a star/big name player in the team which the opposition could fear. Else there is just Rooney who isn't suitable anymore these days.

2587~~~
I see. Maybe he is just playing differently at United then because we don't have that quality of wing option and the team needs something else.

2588~~~
Agree however given his age (and Carrick) we have already created an issue in needing to bring in a replacement fairly soon!

2589~~~
Yes, but right now I don't want to worry about that but just enjoy seeing him every week producing his magic.

2590~~~
Anyone reckon he will start tonight? He's just tweeted about the game so I think he will be involved somehow.

2591~~~
Its amazing we got Bastian and Morgan in one transfer window....midfield is sorted!
We haven't had a midfielder who can control the play and boss the game since Scholes retired, Bastian is the closest thing to Scholes I have seen play for MUFC.

2592~~~
On the bench if we need him, I guess he'll probably play most of the games against Sunderland, Wolfsburg and Arsenal so if we can get away without using him tonight I reckon we will.

2593~~~
Think it's more to do with our wide options then his inability to play that pass.

2594~~~
Pure class from him today. If it weren't against Ipswich i would say his best match since he came.

2595~~~
three words: Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger

2596~~~
He keeps on improving, if he keeps his fitness up he'll be an absolute monster for us for a good 3 years at least.

2597~~~
What. A. Player. Apart from that one misplaced pass, don't think he did anything wrong today, and was still covering the length of the pitch at the ninety minute mark. MotM today by far.

2598~~~
I know it's <i>only </i>Ipswich, but that was a cracking performance. Head and shoulders above every other individual on the field.

2599~~~
fecking top shelf performance. I still can't believe he plays for us. 

Oozes class. Truly a world class player.

2600~~~
Gave motm to Pereira because of the goal but he's just a beast. Only against Ipswich so you'd expect this type of performance from him, but he makes it look so easy. What a signing.

2601~~~
Very, very good performance. Only discouraging thing was that he played 90 minutes, so most probably won't start on the weekend! It's just about getting up to 100% match fitness for him before he starts to put in PL performances like that every week. Today seemed a big step in that direction.

2602~~~
Starting to look like the Schweinsteiger I know. Absolute class today. He was everywhere.

2603~~~
shitty stream but he looked calm and cool as can be.

2604~~~
Unbelievable signing. Master stroke

2605~~~
Hope he's fit enough to start on Saturday.

2606~~~
Actually looked pretty nippy today as well, getting himself around the pitch and dribbling a bit.

I thought we would get passing masterclasses from him sure, but this is even more encouraging.

2607~~~
Can't get enough of the Schwein.

2608~~~
It's just like watching Scholes. Thank you, Bayern.

2609~~~
What a player.

2610~~~
Glided through the game in his Pajamas and slippers reading a copy of the financial times, effortless stuff from him and the undoubted boss on the pitch, most pleasingly is that he's looking so sprightly and full of running.

2611~~~
Majestic.

2612~~~
I know we all love Scholes but this fella is just as good to be honest.

2613~~~
Really gets up and down the pitch, impressive.

2614~~~
Couple of great dribbles tonight...

2615~~~
Class human being, class footballer.

2616~~~
Very smart guy as well. Read that Rooney gave him the armband but Basti gave it to De Gea. Very subtle but clever, showing De Gea how much he's respected by the captain of the world cup winning team no less!

2617~~~
Nothing phases him, so cool and experienced.

2618~~~
A joy to watch. Want to watch the match again in hi def with orgasmic Arabic commentator (no stoic Norwegians) a glass of something nice and me feet up.

2619~~~
I just love it when the opposition are putting pressure on him and he doesn't panic, he just holds them of with his strength and finds the pass he wants. Even Scholes would have been proud of that performance tonight.

2620~~~
He's got the ability to pass and move his way out of trouble that we've not had for years. It's a privilege to watch him play, absolutely fantastic player.

2621~~~
You know when you were a kid and your coach was telling you that your first touch should bring the ball in the direction you want to go in? He does that as well as anyone I've ever watched I think.

2622~~~
Calling Danes Norwegian is like calling Irish Aussie. Or something. It's insulting and stupid anyway.*

*For Norwegians obviously

2623~~~
Ipswich <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2624~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">.
</span>

2625~~~
I'd rather rest him against Sunderland and play him in the UCL.

2626~~~
His touch wasn't too bad tonight in fairness. Took a tricky chance very well for the first goal.

2627~~~
I didn't know this. De Gea was captain?

2628~~~
Better then sex.

2629~~~
After Rooney went off yes

2630~~~
He's just a class act.

2631~~~
There something about him, not just how good he is at football, but the way he approaches things, his attitude, that just makes you so incredibly proud to have him at the club. I know the our bayern fans like <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a> were devastated when he was leaving them (despite the amazing talent that they have left and can attract) and after only a few games with us you can fully understand why.

I remember when the Spanish team were dancing around him during an interview after the EC final loss - I'm so glad for him that he managed to get the WC under his belt after seeing that, he deserved it!

I know he's a Bayern legend but if there was ever another club he was to play for it's us, and I see that as a huge compliment to both him and us.

2632~~~
I love watching him play. He's the first midfielder we've had since Scholes who is actually a joy to watch, and that's no slight on Carrick.

2633~~~
He's beyond brilliant.

2634~~~
Was just talking like in general.

2635~~~
If everyone is raving about him, how come his rating is 6.5?

2636~~~
Anyone playing FIFA 16 just laugh when the commentator says Schweinsteiger?

Still find it hard to believe and a bit funny that he is a United player.

2637~~~
I was so delighted that we signed him, but like everyone else had question marks over his fitness. However, he's already answered those questions. His performance against Liverpool showed that he can easily handle 90 minutes of being up and down the pitch in the premier league (and that was after playing twice in the previous week for Germany). Use him right and look after him a little bit, which LVG seems to be doing, and we can get at least two seasons of top quality from him. A joy to watch and have at the club.

2638~~~
No one should be surprised at how well he's playing. He's the most complete midfielder that we could have hoped to buy - physical and mental abilities in abundance.  They don't all him fussballgott for nothing!

2639~~~
Goddamn he's such a pleasure to watch.  So intelligent, keeps things simple, responsible for starting most of our good play, and seems like a great guy to boot.  Fecking love the man.  He's our playmaker, and as great as Smalling, DDG, and Martial have been, BFS stands out as our most important player.  Our season and any titles that may go along with it, will largely be dependent upon him.

2640~~~
Yeah I appreciate that. Probably like calling us Scottish. But I can't speak either Danish or Norwegian; apparently they are quite similar so I am fecked.

2641~~~
I gave him 9.

2642~~~
Our best player.

2643~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> His average rating for the game is 8. He's leading the MotM poll as well.

2644~~~
We've been starved of a good midfielder so long that many of us don't know how to appreciate one anymore.

2645~~~
At first I wondered if he really is that good, or if we've just become so accustomed to the likes of Cleverley and Anderson that a cabbage in midfield would look tasty. But nope, I'm wrong. Schweinsteiger actually is that good.

2646~~~
He's come on as a sub on a number of occasions. That's probably the reason.

2647~~~
My Danish isn't great but there were a couple of moments they were laughing at how good he was under pressure, and the second time they followed it up with "Ice Man, Mr Cool" which I thought summed things up pretty nicely.

2648~~~
So...is it fair to say you were being a buzzkill for no apparent reason now? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2649~~~
God was he good yesterday. Even started to dribble his way past players and made a few very good runs with the ball. I'm in love with him.

2650~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> who the feck moans about signing Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger? On the same day we also sign Morgan Schneiderlin.

I mean, seriously, what sort of human does this?

2651~~~
We finally have a player again that's among one of the best in the world in his position!

2652~~~
Watching him play reminds me of Scholes, but tbf there is no-one like him. my all time favourite player, imagine and Scholes in the same side <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

2653~~~
We already went through that period with Blind.

2654~~~
Can't believe how good he is. I mean, you knew he was world class but it's not until you watch a player week in week out that you realise just how good he is. And he's one of the best.

We're gonna benefit so much over the next few years. Is it even out of the question that he could get some kind of coaching role at the club? Maybe even AM to Giggs.... <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2655~~~
Our goalkeeper isn't too bad either.

2656~~~
His intelligence is incredible.

2657~~~
BFS , looking very good .

2658~~~
Seems to be getting better with every game. Still can't get my head round  how good he actually  is, or that he actually plays for us!

2659~~~
Fussballgott.

2660~~~
He's a Rolls Royce of a player, simple as that.  He did well yesterday, but you'd expect that given the opposition.  In my opinion, he's our best midfielder.  He's such a smart and commanding player.  A true leader.  He does everything well, and will do anything required to win.  I expect him to improve as he continues to adapt to a new league and country.  I pray he stays healthy this season, as he'll be a key if we're going to challenge for trophies.  What a great role model for the younger players at the club.  His influence will likely be felt beyond the term of his contract.

2661~~~
And that's why he is captain of the world champions.

2662~~~
Heard he had a great turn in our own box taking out 2 players. Any videoa/gifs for that?

2663~~~
I remember that now! Would also love a gif if anyone can provide one.

2664~~~
He's really getting up to speed now, his engine still seems be to there and there's no reason we can't get another 2 quality seasons out of him. £6mil, what a bargain!

2665~~~
It was like watching mozart himself conducting his own Orchestra to symphony 40 in G minor. feck sake he's unbelievably good. I loved that he was playing the Lone DM aswel.

2666~~~
Couldn't agree more. Even though it was just Ipswich, that is how you boss a midfield in every way possible. His command of the position and his subtle movements on and off the ball are incredible. 

I also love how when we're in possession and he doesn't have the ball he's constantly pointing to where we should move the ball. He's always thinking ahead of where the ball needs to go and anticipates what should happen - the mark of a true world class player. We're laughing with him in our team, still can't believe we have him. Like I said yesterday, it's like watching a German version of Scholes. Such a delight.

2667~~~
Bastian is Boss.

2668~~~
6.5 is the new 7.

The old 7 has moved to 7.5.

7.5 is now homeless and thinking of emigrating to the EU.

He's afraid the Hungarians won't let him in, but Schweinsteiger has offered him his old house in Munich.

2669~~~
I have him at 5,9, don't know how that happened <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Actually - it is spelled wrong... 

Deutscher Fu<b>ß</b>ballmeister 

The "u" is long and not short. That is why it is "ß" and not "ss". 

But how could you know!!!

2677~~~
Just twittered them that, it is unforgivable. Next time they will know better.

2678~~~
Sackable offence, tbh. 

But love the pic. Such an honour to have him playing for us.

2679~~~
I just love watching him in United shirt, something i never imagined i would see. He is doing great, much better then i thought he will, especially his fitness and stamina has impressed me. He is just the kind of player who can help other teammates to perform just a little better then they would without him on the pitch and can control the game from midfield with his passing and leadership.

I just hope he can stay fit because i think he will be/is one of the most important players in our squad.

2680~~~
I am not going to get tired of writing how immense this guy has been in our midfield. Our quarterback!

2681~~~
As great as he is going and as much as I want to see him play, I would be tempted to rest him against Sunderland.

2682~~~
Master stroke signing from LVG. He deserves massive credit.

2683~~~
He didn't start against Southampton, he can play two games in a row.

2684~~~
No doubt but we have a must win game during the week, I think he should be 100% for that.

2685~~~
Sunderland are awful, give him a rest.

2686~~~
Yeah I'd say rest him.

Play Schneiderlin and Carrick, then get Schwein on for Carrick for the last 20-30 minutes.

2687~~~
Definitely should rest him. Maybe a little cameo at the end, but I want him for Wolfsburg.

2688~~~
Keep him Fresh for Wolfsburg.

2689~~~
Schneiderlin and Herrera for Southampton, Carrick and Bastian for Wolfsburg.

2690~~~
Assume you meant Sunderland.

I think we will lack legs in midfield with a Carrick-BFS combo. Would like Herrera and Carrick against Sunderland with BFS-Schneiderlin against Wolfsburg.

2691~~~
I really liked Schweinsteiger and Carrick together against Liverpool (true it was only Liverpool, but still) - I think Bastian has enough running in him, and combined they're easily the most intelligent football midfield in all the land.

2692~~~
I don't think he'll be rested and rightly so.

He's 31, not 36 and it's early in the season still where they're match fit and working towards peak fitness. Playing games will help that. It's not like he's been played to exhaustion recently and we don't play til Wednesday. The more he plays, the more he'll settle into a rhythm, we don't need to think about managing his game time like that until we start hitting 3 games in 8 or 9 days over Christmas.

2693~~~
I just feel we might get overrun with those two there. Much like how Scholes and Carrick were both technically brilliant but we kept getting mauled in midfield. Need someone like Schneiderlin to add bite. IMO Carrick and Herrera would work really well together as well.

2694~~~
I'm not familiar with that ever being a "thing". Who exactly kept mauling us?

2695~~~
Certainly did last season

2696~~~
Scholes and Carrick got overrun because we played a less compact system. Rio and co would drop much deeper than we do now and leave big holes in midfield.

2697~~~
Every half-decent team who strolled through our midfield, which is why everyone on here were craving for midfielders.

2698~~~
I agree but a lot of that had to do with neither Scholes (at that age) and Carrick having the legs close teams down.

2699~~~
The Wolfsburg game is very important after our loss in the first game. If he can play only one game then I'd want him to play that one.

2700~~~
I'll cream my pants when he scores his first goal for us. Honest to feck I will.

2701~~~
I think he's my new favourite player.

In fact, I'm sure we've not had as many genuinely admirable players for quite a few years

2702~~~
Just turned 31 when he signed too! Agree he should play, he's coming into match form and fitness so he'll only get better! Wow! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2703~~~
He plays like a real boss on the pitch, and class above everyone else.

2704~~~
Can't believe some didn't want him here. Madness. I was through the roof when it was confirmed. I would have taken him even @ 35 years old. He was one of my favourite non United player. He's now probably my favourite United player. 

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.... Can you believe it <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2705~~~
He's 2 steps ahead of everyone on the pitch just like Scholes.

The ipswich game was just too easy for him.

2706~~~
Extremely noticeable when he's not on the pitch. I understand he's being saved for other games but we really miss him when he's not playing. Imagine if we wouldn't have signed him?

2707~~~
We look a much more positive team when he is on, there's no question of that IMO.

2708~~~
Or if we'd signed him five years ago <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2709~~~
He's just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2710~~~
Around the 80th min he was in a tight spot but some quick feet helped him get out of it and he played a wonderful ball to Valencia who was in acres of space. Was beautiful to watch..

2711~~~
Quite simply a master craftsman what a player. No wonder  Germany are so good. Hope LVGs army has more Germans in it next year (Hummels/Reus/Muller)

2712~~~
Quality bit of composure and skill.

2713~~~
Have people forgotten 06/07 already?

2714~~~
I always knew he was great but having him playing here makes him ten times better..  Deutscher Fußballmeister par xelance..

2715~~~
They played really well together when Scholes came back from retirement too, didn't they?

Carrick and Scholes was the best midfield combination we've had in many a year. If we get a partnership that good going, I'll be very happy.

2716~~~
Nope, but we don't have an attack like that of 06-07, plus 11-12 is fresher in mind <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2717~~~
We were crying for a midfielder because Scholes had lost his legs and Carrick was never the terrier type. We regularly got run over in midfield by mediocre teams.

2718~~~
It's amazing watching a player like Sweinsteiger when he plays for you then you only realize how good he is. I haven't watched much of Bayern in recent years apart from the CL and even at that you generally don't take notice of everyone on the pitch as you would do if its your own team.

2719~~~
Schweinsteiger is like a hybrid of Scholes and Keane. Has the passing range, technical ability of Scholes. Has the engine/boxtobox drive of Keane as well as some of the leadership qualities. Can run the game from deep, can get forward to supplement attacks. He's a joy to watch. I'm interested to see if he can add goals to his game, had a decent record at Bayern.

2720~~~
I love the fact that we have both him and Carrick. Each adds something different to the team.

2721~~~
He makes the game look incredibly simple, the best way i can describe him on the pitch.

A pleasure to watch live always in space and never looks rushed!

2722~~~
I have to hold my hands up and say he has been an absolute mile better than I expected. Whilst I didnt think he would do <i>badly</i> for us, I had big doubts around his age and injury record but he has been absolutely dominating the midfield. Very much a complete midfielder - imagine if we had thrown the kitchen sink at Bayern and got him 5 years ago or so, could well have been the difference between us bagging another CL or two.

2723~~~
The best midfielder in the league buy a mile. Hope we sign a few more Germans Hummels Reus Muller would be nice!

2724~~~
He is what a proper midfielder looks like. 
Really hope we start him against Arsenal, we look much better with him in the team.

2725~~~
I love how as soon as he gets on the pitch he starts dictating everything, pointing everywhere, being vocal, proper leader and looks like he's been here for years.

2726~~~
That's what you get when you buy the Germany captain. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2727~~~
Schweini might just go on to be my favorite footballer of all time...A mix of Keane and Scholes even though he perhaps is not 100% the warrior he once was but still world class - he's a monster on the pitch and a true gentleman off it.....I just love him.....I would have him 1000 times ahead of Giggs as our next manager when Van Gaal quits...He just looks like someone who has the personality to be a monster manager if he ever chooses to go down that path and he'd be able to sign a lot of top German kids along the way too

2728~~~
I think he will end up at Bayern at some point eventually, in the sporting or management department.

2729~~~
Agreeing with what so many of us are saying - we all knew he was a top player but had no idea the character of the man and truly happy we have him in squad.  Absolutely no doubt he's already one of the leaders and how he speaks of helping the kids and young players to make the best of their talents and careers is brilliant for united but speaks volumes about the man too.  

Not saying the likes of Carrick etc aren't doing this as well but just happy that someone like his has taken such an interest in the club and players, a lot of players his age would move for one big pay cheque and not do what he's doing for us

No wonder bayern fans were so sad to see him leave.

2730~~~
Haven't bought a kit since RVP in 2012, but if anyone is worth it, its schweinsteiger. Got the home kit. Can't wait <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2731~~~
I think this guy will prove a very astute signing as the season progresses......

2732~~~
I've rated Schweinsteiger at 7.5 so far on this site this year which reflects my optimism and admiration with what he brings to the squad.  There is no player in the club that is more vital to our performances.  I think he's been "managed" a good bit so far... working him into the club and into LVG's vision of "fitness".  I think if he will stay healthy and show energy for 90 minutes, that he'll start getting the lion's share of minutes for one of the holding mid spots.  Good Lord I hope so!!!   He is a monster for us!  

With a potential 60 fixture schedule...  I know LVG will be careful not to burn BFS out but he needs to be on the pitch on every big game!

2733~~~
Just had a good chuckle. 
On Schweiny's instagram, there's a picture of him and Rooney warming up, and one of the comments says:

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Not sure what I find more funny.

2734~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Sounds like our Facebook page thread

2735~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2736~~~
Usually when we buy a player (especially high profile ones), it takes about a season or so to sink in that he's one of "ours". I love RVP for what he did for us in 12-13, but for that whole season I couldn't shake the weird feeling that he wasn't really a Manchester United player; I associated him so much with Arsenal. I felt like that with Mata until last season too right.

But with Schweinsteiger, for some reason seeing him in our kit clicked with me instantly. This is the fastest I've felt this way about a new player since Carrick in 2006.

2737~~~
Yeah, same here. I think that's partly down to his role as midfield general being mainly down to our current manager. Reminds me of the Keane-Fergie dynamic, where a player is the manager's embodiment on the pitch.

2738~~~
I think he'll dominate this game today.  I hope the ball touches his feet a LOT!!!

He looks to be settling into a box-to-box role for us and with his and Blind's passing coming from the back and midfield, I'm hopeful we'll sharpen our attack.

2739~~~
Gif of that reaction please. That was hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2740~~~
I thought I had missed a previous yellow and he was getting sent off the way he was going on!

2741~~~
Guy's still got some B2B juice left in the tank. Game is poised for him to score the winner from distance.

2742~~~
He is excellent.

2743~~~
BFS

2744~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2745~~~
It wasnt the foul, but the ref is a joke at times. The yellow a minute before his was a scandal.

2746~~~
I think he was annoyed by the way the Wolfsburg player cried when he made the tackle.

2747~~~
Best player on either team so far for me. Winning the ball time and again, and pulling the strings of so many of our best moves.

2748~~~
Poor Arnold must have been shittin his pants when Schweinsteiger was having a go at him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2749~~~
I think he got frustrated at the lack of options our #10 gives him as he's always too close to him. Not sure why we brought him off as we lost our composure without him, hope it's not a knock.

2750~~~
I think if Carrick has a knock then we really need Schweinsteiger for Arsenal on Sunday so he was taken off to keep him fresh.

2751~~~
Very good, we fell apart when he came off.

2752~~~
Van Gaal just said on German TV said he did not think that Bastian played good today and that he subbed him because of that.

2753~~~
Its hard to understand our manager sometimes..

2754~~~
Tell me that's a joke?!

2755~~~
I errrrrm errrrr...no I've got nothing.

2756~~~
Not really, Bastian was frustrated with himself. Our midfield was very open the whole match.

It's just a blip. Even God has to take Sunday off. Our fussballgott will be alright.

2757~~~
Must have been watching a different match. Apart for the first 10 minutes we dominated them with Bastian being at the heart of it all.

2758~~~
I'm watching the game again at the moment, it's the 30th min mark and we were controlling squats in midfield.

In a way, it's not really his fault, Wolfsburg bypassed the midfield a lot by going down the wings and played lots of long balls down the middle.

2759~~~
I think it's about where you are now we start taking over the game, then once he gets subbed off they get back into the game.

2760~~~
No. And the German Sky guys told that he did not give any interviews to them but rushed into his car after the match.

2761~~~
We've been missing what he brings. He's got a big footballing brain, great passing range, he gets stuck in, his technique is flawless, and he carries the ball. We've not seen all of those attributes in a single player for a good long while. We can count on him to tackle, to speed or slow down play, to cut open defences, and to retain the ball well in a tight spot.

I expected no less from a Weltmeister, but boy is it refreshing.

2762~~~
I actually agree with this to an extent.

Basti was brilliant through 60-70% of his time on the pitch, being an absolute boss. But he also made som horrible decisions at times, and they could have cost us three points.

2763~~~
Just finished the 1st half. He was barely involved after Mata's goal except for the tackle and yellow card. Rooney kept dropping deep, hogging the ball and spread it down the wings didn't help him either.

You may disagree and show me the moments he was involved, but after 2 viewings I think it's safe to say for a variety of reasons, he didn't really have a good match today.

2764~~~
So you missed the balls he played behind their defence in the first half?

The only player in our team willing to try it and make use of Martials pace.

2765~~~
The ball that Martial chased down but was offside?

A few isolated moments did not a good performance maketh. It's ok to say that he didn't have his best day. I love him too.

2766~~~
It wasn't the best performance on an individual level, but it's difficult to over-state the effect he has on a game even when he's not playing at his absolute best.

2767~~~
I was at the game and this is what I saw, even if he had a few iffy moments everything was going through him. He was given a standing ovation and we fell to pieces when he went off

2768~~~
Completely underrated this season, had another great game this evening. Keeps our team ticking perfectly.

2769~~~
What? Most people are wanking over him, he has not been bad, but the praise he gets on here is imo way ott.

2770~~~
We need a gif of his reaction after recieving the card! I've never seen a player so upset after recieving a yellow when not getting banned for the next game.

2771~~~

2772~~~
And he also totally deserved it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> was hilarious

2773~~~
That was ridiculous from the ref though, two players clatter going for the same ball. At best it's a warning. Same with Schneiderlin's. Soft as hell.

2774~~~
Cheers! Made my day <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2775~~~
Everyone gets a standing ovation these days though, does my head in.

2776~~~
That was brilliant, love how he seemingly berates one of the Wolfsburg players for signalling for a card.

2777~~~
If Herrera can't play against Arsenal and Carrick is fit, I think I'd start Schweinsteiger as the 10 against Arsenal. Far more likely to play a killer pass or finish off a move than Rooney. 

Worst case we'll be stronger defensively and have someone to help on Cazorla and can always remove one of Carrick or Schneiderlin in the 2nd half for a more offensive option.

2778~~~
I love him even more after today. I must have been watching a different game to LvG as well then because I thought he was brilliant. He's steadily improved and grown in stature as the season had gone on. He's got such quality and had a hand in everything we did tonight. 

We also lost all composure and were under severe pressure after he went off. I hope he starts against Arsenal.

2779~~~
One of the best reactions after an yellow card. Ever <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Fussballgot, Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

2780~~~
I got the 'feck you' part but what about the rest?

2781~~~
Nature of the game changed after he was subbed off. We lacked composure and drive without him. Just shows how important he is to our game.

And his biggest asset is his intelligence.

2782~~~
We were like headless chickens without him.

2783~~~
It gets more amazing the more you see it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2784~~~
He is easily my favourite player already. Pure, absolute, unadulterated class.

2785~~~
I agree.  He's so important for our club.

2786~~~
I've seen that reaction about 20 times now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Showed it to my family as they missed the match. BFS <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2787~~~
Beastian FS. Signing of the summer. Value.

2788~~~
Time to see the yellow card reaction again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2789~~~
Don't really understand Van Gaal on this; thought Schweiny was very good, breaking up the play and I loved the passing range he displayed. But then again, I'm not a football coach.

The reaction to the booking was hilarious. I genuinely had no idea what was going on, had my heart in my mouth thinking it was a red for a moment.

2790~~~
He is not milk. He is a man.

2791~~~
What a buy!

2792~~~
Probably posted before but I'm not going to scroll 5 pages.

2793~~~
What a man. I remember Fabio/Rafael got the armband once and just wore it for the rest of the match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2794~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Can't wait!!

2795~~~
It was Rafael, who came and just took the armband for himself. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Then SAF ruffled his hair after game, and Rafael got that picture put onto a shirt and wore it on SAF's last game. Love me some Rafa. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2796~~~
I miss the guy. Adorable <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2797~~~
Should still be a United player <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. One of the few LVG decisions I disagree with. Not many players out there with so much heart.

2798~~~
It amazes me a bit that so many oppo fans seem to just have written him off as past it just because Bayern respected his wishes to leave. He's still the same world class midfielder he was, he just needed a run of games to get fit. Best midfielder in the league IMO.

2799~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2800~~~
It seems the narrative has been decided before he kicked a ball in a United shirt, even the better UK based pundits have yet to give him any credit.

2801~~~
Bastian is my current favourite player and has somehow made himself my 2nd of all time after Eric in such a short time. His leadership, coolness and class should make him our captain regardless of how long he's been here. We need a captain like this.

2802~~~

2803~~~
I'm going to be really disappointed for him if he never wins anything with us. Such a quality player and he deserves it after leaving Bayern to come here

2804~~~
I want him to lift the premier league trophy next season. As captain.

2805~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2806~~~
Sorry, but that's ridiculous.

2807~~~
why? He can like who ever he wants.

2808~~~
I know. It's still ridiculous. I'm ridiculing it.

How long has he been a fan of Manchester United? Schweinsteiger has played seven games for us, and he's his second favourite player <i>of all time</i>?

2809~~~
I knew it, all part of the masterplan. comes in like a boss, large brandy in hand and is offered the captaincy. "not yet mate, finishing my brandy"

2810~~~
Are you the infamous Adolf Hatelove? Are you that hateful that you can't let the man love? <span style="color: #ffffff">I deeply apologize.</span>

2811~~~
Blame Fifa

2812~~~
Its odd if he didnt like him before the transfer i give you that. Players and clubs are two different things though, its normal that you like more United players as you follow them closely but one of my favorite player of all time is a legend of Arsenal, our rival club. In your view thats probably ridiculous.

He is in my 3 favorite players from the current squad but i liked him before the transfer.

2813~~~
No, not at all. Probably more of my favourite players of all time are non-United than United. But saying that a player is 'one of your favourites ever' and that a player is 'one of your favourite <i>United players</i> ever' are completely different things. However awesome Schweinsteiger is, he's barely stepped on the pitch as a United player yet compared to any of the usual candidates.

It's a sign of the times that you'd probably get a majority of fans saying they don't much like Wayne Rooney, one of our greatest ever strikers and the heart and backbone of the club practically since we first bought him 11 years ago, but you can find fans saying Bastian Schweinsteiger is their favourite ever United player.

2814~~~
Bergkamp?

2815~~~
the last thing i want is start a debate about Rooney but you probably picked a wrong player for example. I get what you saying but people who dont like Rooney have good reasons(i am one of them) for that and it has nothing to do with his performances on the pitch.

yap <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2816~~~
He was a magical player to watch. Zola too.

2817~~~
I won't argue Rooney, I think ultimately it's no different than any other example and the 'other reasons' are superficial excuses, but it's complicated and unnecessary to argue.

Let's say Vidic instead. Vidic was as good, relatively, in his position for around the same period of time as Schweinsteiger. But Vidic did it entirely at Manchester United, whereas Schweinsteiger has done it entirely (bar <i>seven games) </i>at another club. You don't think it's daft that Vidic probably doesn't even come into the <i>conversation</i> for Von Mistelraum about his favourite United player ever but Schweinsteiger is second only to Cantona?

2818~~~
Haha you just remembered me about this. I started following United pretty early when i was 6-7 years old. And one day my mom took me and my two brothers to the shop where they were selling football shirts. The seller asked me which shirt i want and i tried to tell him that i wan't Beckham's shirt but didn't even know how to pronouce it correctly and he just brought Bergkamp one (luckily national). I really don't know if i could read or not but it looked wrong that a shirt was orange so i asked if it shouldn't be red and he said to me it's national one. I said ok still thinking i bought Beckham shirt and the disapointment when i found out it is not Beckham on the back was just unreal.

Still it could be worse, Bergkamp was a class player.

2819~~~
But he isnt naming best players or the players that did most for the club. You dont like only best players around, everyone has different reasons for liking a player. Sheasy would probably be close to my favorite United 11 and he was never a first choice let alone for some prolonged period we are talking now.

2820~~~
Well, I still think it should take more than seven games for a player to become your favourite no matter what your reasons. O'Shea may not have been brilliant or ever first choice but he was here for a long fecking time, and that's integral to his 'favourite ability'.

Maybe if those seven games had been the seven knockout CL games leading up to us lifting the trophy...

2821~~~
if he liked him before than its not odd in my book, some people need that United bond + i dont see that he mentions United in his post...just an all time favorite player along with Cantona.

2822~~~
Looks like the captain at times tbh.

2823~~~
Actually it's not quite as ridiculous as it might appear. You see, there's this thing called free thought.....marvelous thing it is too! Allows a person to decide on their own ideas and even little things like who their favourite footballers might be. For example, a certain, devilishly handsome person might have watched a certain player for many seasons at a certain German club and always held a certain level of regard for said player. They may have even wished, on many occasions that the player in question played for the team he supports. He might even have been known to watch rather more of this other, possibly German, team's matches simply to watch the player in question, only to find that one day, the stars had aligned in such a way that a minor miracle had occurred and that very special player had, against all odds, finally wound up at the very team that our vigilant protagonist supports.

But alas! The player had been said by some to be coming to the end of his career, past the peak of his powers and was, in fact, unable to even last a full ninety minutes on the football pitch. And yet, our hero kept the faith, feeling in his gut that signing for the world's greatest club would revitalise the player and....lo and behold! Ninety minutes <i>were</i> completed! Calm, classy, stylish football <i>was</i> played once more by the veteran, possibly German, star! The dragon was slain and at last, peace finally returned to the realm. Hang on, what was I talking about again? Ah, sod it, the point is that I believe I can decide this for myself, thanks <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Oh, and I missed the part where you asked how long I have supported United. Well I'm 38 now and I've supported United since I was around 7-8. You know what else? My third favourite player ever never played for United :O

2824~~~
You mean the same Wayne Rooney who held the club to ransom twice for a payrise, who fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson and really should've been sold but we're now stuck with him and his horrible decline in quality?

That Wayne Rooney?

fecking hell people don't like THAT Wayne Rooney? Shit the bed mate.

Heart and backbone my fecking arse.

2825~~~
Oh no he asked to leave once. Giggs shagged his brothers missus. Keane did far worse (then Rooney I should specify, not Giggs). Rio missed a drug test and was suspended for a long time for being an idiot. Cantona was suspended for a long time for being an idiot. Footballers do stupid things. You can overlook little things when a player is going to become the all time top scorer of a club I think.

2826~~~
Pretty sure Best wasn't a saint either? Heard so on here.

2827~~~
Yep. Law and Schemeichel actually played for City as well. Ronaldo left after 6 years. Yet Rooney because he had a little fall out but ended up staying anyway and is set to become our all time leading goal scorer has people hate him because he dared ask for a raise. Drama queens on here ffs.

2828~~~
It's been a distant dream come true to see BFS in United colors. Admired him since so long and now playing with us. It's surreal and exciting. Hope we can get the best out of him and he goes to Giggsy way of prolonging his career.

2829~~~
You can hate him all you want, but whatever may have happened during those falling-outs, no-one with eyes could question that for the vast majority of his time with us that has been true on the pitch. Fans can be very precious, but ask the players who has been the heart of this team for all those years and you'd get a unanimous answer.

2830~~~
Quite.

2831~~~
He looked absolutely knackered after being taken off on Wednesday evening ..

2832~~~
Everyone else's thread seems to have been bumped, surprised this one hasn't. 

One of the main reasons for the gaping hole in our midfield, why the feck does he keep pushing up in his own? 

Horrendous so far.

2833~~~
You could actually see him pleading to the bench for us to make a change. He's having a shocker not being helped out by Carrick and Rooney either though.

2834~~~
He's not having a great game at CF/AM/LW/RW ... shame he's not playing Centre Midfield though as he'd be quite useful there.

2835~~~
Him and Rooney look like they swapped positions. Was caught up the field far too often.

2836~~~
Must have been instructed to by Van Gaal. 

His worst performance for us.

2837~~~
He's not the problem, he's actually running around like a midfielder should whilst Carrick and Rooney plod around like idiots. Not that I expect Neville to make a fuss about that. Schweinsteiger drops deeper than Carrick when we have the ball and presses higher than Rooney when we don't have it, it's not his fault he's trying to play 3 positions by himself.

2838~~~
It is when one of them isn't central midfield.

2839~~~
We have a massive gaping hole in front of our defense and he is pressing the centre backs.

2840~~~
Schweini has to press up high because Rooney and Mata aren't.

2841~~~
Possibly because Rooney and Memphis aren't closing anyone down. They're just watching the game happen. Schweinsteiger is doing Rooney's job for him, which I'm not excusing him for, because it leaves too much space in behind. 

Schweinsteiger should play as the advanced midfielder, and Carrick and Schneiderlin can sit. Rooney should go off because he's not really offering anything.

2842~~~
I don't know how he could play so positionally poor for a CM of his vast experience.

2843~~~
Of course he is a part of the problem. He is nowhere to be seen when Arsenal have the ball.

2844~~~
Yeah, he's been horrible so far.

2845~~~
He's obviously following orders today, van Gaal's been outdone by Wenger today.

2846~~~
Uzz knows.

2847~~~
He is our only midfielder doing anything a midfielder should be doing, it is not his fault that Rooney can't press or drop into Schweinsteiger's postion when he presses or that Carrick is too immobile. He's been doing this every game for us so far, I think if anything van Gaal has been too naive in our setup and perhaps the whole team should drop off as a whole.

2848~~~
He's trying to do Rooneys job for him.

2849~~~
He usually does this while the other sits so I guess it comes from LVG. Either one of him or our staff should have realised it wasn't working after 5 minutes and changed it though.

2850~~~
Mata? They're playing different sides of the pitch. Rooney hasn't helped in there at all but Schwein has still been awful.

2851~~~
Gone all kamikaze.

2852~~~
As shit as Rooney has been, trying to blame him for Schweinsteiger being shit is ridiculous. 

He's one of the most experienced midfielders in the game and he's wandering all over the frigging place leaving huge gaps in behind himself.

2853~~~
There is no pressing of Arse's midfielders. Memphis is doing it on his side, but Rooney isn't doing it and Mata isn't doing it which is why Schweini is leaving a huge gap behind him.

2854~~~
Awful, awful, awful off the ball. I can understand why he's in the team, because his movement in the attacking third adds a different dimension to our otherwise flat midfield (unless Herrera is there to that job, which he isn't), but off the ball he has been shocking. He, like the rest of our midfield, including wingers, are nothing more than mildly lively traffic cones in this match.

2855~~~
There's a robotic element to Van Gaal's teams. No doubt Basti was told to get forward and support pre-game, but instead of stopping when things went wrong he's carried on.

2856~~~
After a totally bizarre first half he was good in the second offering the energy and drive to keep us pushing at Arsenal.

2857~~~
I dont get why Basti is being flamed, he was 10x Carrick.

2858~~~
That first half was mental. Has to be instructed to do that.

2859~~~
Great footballer but that was shocking. A man of his experience leaving centre midfield wide open, time after time.

2860~~~
Seemed like he was frustrated with the flatness of the whole team and as a result ran around like a madman everywhere which didn't really help us. In the second half he was probably one of our better players still.

2861~~~
I thought he was great in the second half.

Neville kept laying into him in the beginning but it was clear he was being told to push on, not his fault if he's being instructed to do something wrong.

2862~~~
He was good. Worked his bollocks off. Needs runners around him though. Carrick and him will not be good enough against pacey, top teams.

2863~~~
Pathetic stuff from him. Playing him and carrick immediately drops our tempo.

2864~~~
He worked far harder than Rooney or Carrick. If Rooney put a similar shift in during the first half Schweinsteiger maybe wouldn't have needed to push so far forward. Maybe he was naive to keep doing it but he was the only one pressing like he did and looked like he gave a shit.

2865~~~
Who cares if he looks likes he gives a shit when he's leaving us exposed in the first half. It was stupid and Neville was right.

2866~~~
Neville was also ignorant at Rooney's, Memphis' and Young's failings in that. If Schweinsteiger was following his man, he's part of a unit that should also follow their men. If you stop an outlet ball to any of those players, you stop the run in behind. Rooney, Memphis and Young didn't cope with that at all and so the openings were available. 

Blaming Schweinsteiger in an isolated case would be ok but this was a clear instruction and a repeated exercise throughout the game and as such the whole unit needs to be scrutinised too. To blame Schweinsteiger alone is wrong, in fact when you consider the above, you could actually say he was the least to blame from all of the aforementioned parties.

2867~~~
So people thought he just pressed around like a headless chicken by himself? Really? Not his fault for the instructions.

2868~~~
Well he did.

I suspect the problem actually was that other players that were supposed to be pressing weren't, i.e. Memphis, Rooney but if they're not he has to the presence to cajole them to do it and not to run around like a loon because a one man press doesn't work.

2869~~~
He was 100x better than Cariick who I think shouldn't be anywhere near the team atm. Playing like he's about to retire.

2870~~~
If the rest of the unit isn't pressing, you shouldn't either unless you're a forward and you're not going to leave a massive hole behind you.

An experienced player like Schweinsteiger should see how Young was struggling down his side and hold his position or call Memphis to come back.

And if this is a tactical instruction then LVG should be blamed. He should've seen his instructions weren't working and should've told Schwein to hold his position until half time.

2871~~~
Stats:
1 shot
1 on target
79/92 passes
85.9% completed
11 attacking passes failed, of which 5 were through balls into the box.
33/34 middle third passes.
6/6 defensive passes.
2/4 crosses
3/3 take ons
1 chance created
3/7 tackles
1 block
1 aerial duel won

Statistically he was our best player looking at the above.

2872~~~
To be fair he should't need to cajole the captain into putting in a shift. Memphis does need to up his game with the effort he puts in defensively though.

2873~~~
Sure, but then someone has to stand up and get some instructions to the players and change it. Leaving it up to them when nobody steps up is not the answer.

2874~~~
Shocking in the first half, much better in the second.

2875~~~
plus if the others saw him furthest forward you would expect one of them to try and cover for a few seconds

2876~~~
LVG said last year he expects players to see danger and think for themselves

2877~~~
That is working quite well. I guess he will leave in a year and our players still wont be able to think for themselves, so i dont know what the fuss is all about.

2878~~~
We're talking about 5-10 minutes into the game. I don't think he can expect them to all collectively shit their pants and not do their jobs or what they talked about the whole week leading up to it.

I'd have been fuming if I was Van Gaal.

2879~~~
Judging by LVG's post match comments he wasn't. So odd for a player of his experience to ignore his instructions as drastically as that though.

2880~~~
He pressed all game, which tells me LVG did instruct him to do it. The bad thing about pressing is, if you do it alone you look an absolute madman. Rooney Memphis and Mata didnt press for shit in the first half. 

I had 0 issues with his perfomance tbh. Whilst Neville was screaming at him for trying to be proactive, I was looking what Rooney was doing and wondering why he aint doing the same. People need to realise, Basti is playing as a box to box and as a number 10 for us. He is doing his and Rooneys jobs.

2881~~~
Needs to learn he isnt 27 any more he cant cover the ground he once did, the amount of times he was caught out of position today was ridicules!

should also never be on the pitch at he same time as carrick!

2882~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's 30 not 35! He had the energy to do the running but was just out of position too often. Whether it was LVG instructions or off his own back it didn't work today

2883~~~
Schweinsteiger was just doing the wrong thing, it wasn't like Carrick who just looked utterly incapable of having any influence on the game even after Arsenal decided to sit back.

2884~~~
well first of he is 31 <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> and as a fellow 31 year old, i can promise you i can run as fast as i did 5 years ago <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> 

so  yes he did a lot of running today, but you still have to get back and cover your position, and he just doesnt have the legs to do that anymore, so he charged forward then just can't get back like he use to, kind of like evra in his last season or so with us, still charged forward but no longer had the legs to get bk and left us exposed. same thing was happening today with schweinsteiger.

2885~~~
Ok then 31 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I just don't get peoples obsession with players losing all of their fitness when they hit that age. He still covers a lot of ground and the issues today were positioning rather than not being able to cover the ground. Get any CM in the world to press as high as Schweinsteiger did today and they would all have the same issues with leaving the midfield exposed

2886~~~
He was very lucky not to be taken off at half time because he was so bad in the first half it was embarrassing to watch him. He did redeem himself a bit in the second half though to be fair.

2887~~~
people do lose thier fittness as they get past 30, it just happens, especially when uve had the injurys schweinsteiger has had.

of course you are gonna leave gaps like if you press high, but you do it with a player who can't cover the ground like he once did and you leave your self very exposed.

add carrick to the mix, a player who has always struggled against teams playing high tempo football, and isnt a player who covers a lot of ground,  and you get the utter mess we saw on the field today

2888~~~
Judging by what Van Gaal's criticisms of the midfield were I would highly doubt he was complaining about Schweinsteiger.

2889~~~
You're both right there.

Schweini's problem is just like Herrera's. Far too good and dynamic to be playing one-pace, highly disciplined positional possession football.

It's their natural instincts to press and move and continually run around the pitch looking for the ball etc. If they have team mates or tactics that played to this, they would be effing brilliant.

But like in today's game, call it naivety, lack of discipline or being let down by team mates too willing to play the status quo, their willingness to actually try and make an impact on the game meant they exposed themselves and their team mates.

2890~~~
LvG did say that he couldnt change much as most of the players could have been taken off. I guess most of our starting eleven were lucky that theres a limit to number of subs per game.

2891~~~
Whatever he was playing at today in the first half, it was absolutely ridiculous. Just kept leaving the midfield totally and utterly open, for Arsenal to waltz through at will. 

Suicidal tactics.

2892~~~
I haven't watched the match - but Schweinsteiger often has problems to come into the match at the beginning. I remember e.g. that it was like this in atleast one of the matches at Arsenal before, the first Juve match in the treble season, the CL final - even the World Cup final - and yes, some of the Dortmund matches, too, as they often start the match rushing it (but seem to loose it later on).

2893~~~
Seriously, why was he playing so far forward?

2894~~~
Both him and Carrick played very strangely I thought. As though they had a third man in a holding role behind the pair of them, giving them license to both get forward and provide attacking support. Ideally that DM role would have been filled by Schneiderlin with Rooney watching on from the stands. But since we didn't set up with a three man midfield, it needed to be the case that when one of them went forward the other held their position to offer Smalling and especially Blind, protection. The amount of space that Ozil had to operate in at times was ridiculous. You have to question the tactical instructions and what van Gaal was thinking setting up in that way in a big game away against Arsenal.

2895~~~
100% sure he was told to press that high up front. It sometimes looked like he was playing as a second striker off the ball, a CM of his experience would never do that if he wasn't given any instructions.
Apart from that an average game but I had to laugh at his face when Ramsey tried to stir shit up.

2896~~~
Is that your polite way of saying 'shitely'? You expect much better from such experienced players in a big game, but ye you do have to ask what their instructions were and Van Gaal must take some blame

LVG was asked about Schein's position in the post match - his response was difficult to understand as I think the question was getting lost in translation along the way, but he didnt seem happy and mentioned a change in the 2nd half. His play seemed almost niave at the start, running round like a headless chicken.

2897~~~
I was almost screaming "let 'em go!" in the pub when that happened. Bastian would have destroyed Ramsey if things came down to that.

2898~~~
Well, van Gaal's tactics seemed to involve having Carrick and Schweinsteiger press very high up the pitch to put pressure on Arsenal's midfielders. If that is indeed the case, they did as instructed although I accept that they should have seen the danger far sooner for players who have that level of awareness and understanding of how to control a game. We were still piling forward at 2-0 down and leaving huge gaps which is utterly insane and very unlike what you'd expect from a typical van Gaal side. You'd have expected one or both of them to try and calm things down, there was still 80 minutes to play. It was the sort of naive display we saw from Arsenal last season ironically.

2899~~~
It was just utterly bizzare. If they brought out a DVD of how not to play against Arsenal, it would just be a replay of our first half performance today.

I honestly don't know what LVG was thinking.

2900~~~
He improved in the second. Was suicidal pressing in the first though.

2901~~~
Gary's criticism of him in 1st half was winding me up yesterday.  He was pressing up the pitch because nobody else was (Rooney) which should have been perfectly ok as the missing player (Rooney) should have slotted in to cover, unfortunately that didn't happen.

I do agree however, Bastion should of known or at least realised very quickly he would get no help and just sat back & let Arsenal come at us.  At least they wouldn't have got in behind our midfield so easily.

2902~~~
He is an all action midfielder, and you can see how he was doing everything/trying to do too much. He was always available for a pass. There was a moment in the 2nd half where the ball was on the near touchline and he was passing it short to Valencia (or Mata), and moments later it was on the left wing and there he was trying to dictate play again. 

Yesterday, the 1st half was pretty abysmal for the whole team, but in the 2nd half you can see how he tried to force the issue where as others weren't.

2903~~~
I personally thought he was slightly better than Carrick, although thats saying nothing because Carrick looked completely past it. He did try to make a few things happen coming wide and getting some crosses in. But yes his pressing left us exposed far too often

2904~~~
It must be hard to be in the exile in Manchester when Felix and Usain Bolt are rocking the Oktoberfest...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://7LjGTk9SzY8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7LjGTk9SzY8</a>

2905~~~
There were times that Schweinsteiger went to press the ball and Carrick just stood there a good 10m not covering the space he left. All Arsenal did for that first 20 mins was play the ball into the space left by Schweinsteiger when he moved up. One straight pass consistently beat 3 or 4 of your players.

2906~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm sorry but these are always the most ridiculous posts.

2907~~~
For me, it indicates that the whole gameplan was shit from the start, including individual instructions. Schweinsteiger tried his best, but the task that was asked of him was certainly exposing us and the damage was already done from the moment he probably realized what the whole situation was. I agree with you when you mention that it was because Rooney didn't do his job that Schweinsteiger was so far up front.

2908~~~
My impression was, that he tried to press the deep play making of Arsenal, while other players had a different idea of how to play. He left acres of space behind him, that no one covered. It was really weird, because it is certainly reasonable to press Arsenal high up the pitch, but it doesn´t make sense that Schweinsteiger would have to do it all the time. No one else did it and he was drawn out again and again.

It is something that happened occasionally in other matches as well (we just weren´t punished). Nobody is putting pressure on the guy with the ball, so Schweinsteiger would charge forward to do so. It is a high-risk lose-lose Situation. You can´t allow players to have so much time on the ball, but Schweinsteiger shouldn´t be the guy, who pressures the deeplying playmakers. I hope, that the team learns something from the last game. They have to be all on the same page, when it comes to pressing.

2909~~~
The tactics were way off. What was he doing way up the pitch? Obviously that had to be instructed since thats not natural for him.

2910~~~
You should seriously consider retiring from watching football. 


He was trying to do the job of Memphis/Rooney all on his own, United have played with a high press all season and those 2 just stood around allowing Arsenal's CB's and MF all the time in the world. His heat map showed an average position higher than Rooney's which perectly illustrates just how bad Rooney is as a 10. 

Being new at the club I suspect he thought Rooney was actually a capable footballer, it wasn't enough that he was doing the pressing for Rooney but he didn't even have the intelligence to cover for Basti when he left the CM and we got horribly exposed.

Playing a system with a high line falls to bits when a few players don't do their jobs and vs a side like Arsenal we got torn apart.

2911~~~
I was thinking this, he must be baffled what he is seeing. This is the guy who lifted the world cup for Germany and grown up at Bayern, I think he would know a thing or 2 about team shape and discipline in sides who follow instruction.

We are comparing the current German captain with the current England captain. The difference is staggering

2912~~~
Really surprised by the amount of shit he got from the media after one bad game, would be nice to judge him after some time but I saw an incredibly high amount of criticism for him as compared to our other players even though pretty much every player was bad.

2913~~~
I mean just bizarre why he got singled out so much

2914~~~
Because Rooney, Carrick and Young are English and therefore exempt from it. Martial is likeable right now and can't be subjected to negativity while Memphis wasn't on long enough.

It's wrong. Schweinsteiger was arguably our best player statistically.

2915~~~
See, I don't agree with this sentiment. Rooney seems to get a bit of a free ride by many in the press, but Carrick has largely been under appreciated and Young isn't liked either because of his antics. I'd say it's more because he's a big name signing on big wages.

2916~~~
Because Neville made such a big deal of it

2917~~~
It was utterly suicidal play from Schweinsteiger but it totally exposes the Carrick deep down we all know. I don't get the high praise/he's under appreciated bs. He does a decent job most of the time and is very good at best but he is a passenger and his style of play is completely playing to the status quo and 'tacitical positioning' i.e being content with sitting deep.

I think Schweini does what Schweini wants i.e he might get told tactics etc but his natural instincts will dictate where is on the pitch and most managers will allow that because of his ability and leadership. I think the LVG post match interview sort of confirms it for me. The interviewer basically asked 'why was he pressing so high and was it your instructions?' and LVG's quizzical response was to dodge any direct criticism of Schwein's movements and his own tactics (because they didn't matched i.e he didn't want to admit who was 'wrong').

2918~~~
Stupid and lazy journalism. So was Schweinsteiger caught high pressing or was he out maneuvered by the younger mobile midfield? You cant claim both of those things, you have to decide on one.

I re watched the match and still have the same feeling I had at the time. He was doing the all the pressing alone and the players around him especially the attacking lot either should have backed him or the management team should have told him to calm down. Judging by the fact that everyone pressed with him in the second half and he wasnt taken off, I would like to think he was let down by his team mates and not by the coaches.

Here is Ronaldo doing a similar thing and realising his mates are just walking around watching him.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWFD5ZjdrkA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2919~~~
Yeah, his pressing was fine. It would've worked if he rest did it as well, but it was only him and rooney really. Memphis didn't do much pressing, Carrick went hiding all game and there were huge gaps all over the pitch because of this. Carrick and Schweinsteiger as a partnership just doesn't work because Carrick cant play in a huge paced and high pressing game anymore. The flak schweinsteiger has received in the media is wayyyyy off, it should be Carrick being criticized if anyone from the midfield. Schweinsteiger did his job basically as he does every game from a pressing view point. The others didn't work with him though.

2920~~~
But you can't really do the pressing alone when the rest of the team isn't because that's pointless and leaves us vulnerable as it did. Agree with people saying that he was naive with his pressing in the first half an hour or so because it was annoying to see him play #10 at times. But yea, shit he gets is just funny but that's to be expected as nobody would touch Rooney despite him being 10000 times worse and being shit this season, the criticism has to fall somewhere.

And obviously agree that him and Carrick can't play together because it's too slow, especially with useless captain in front of them.

2921~~~
I totally blame LvG. The team he picked left us so badly exposed. Schneiderlin had to start. He is the most mobile of our midfielders. Rooney should not have played. Schweinsteiger at least made an effort. Carrick did absolutely nothing.

2922~~~
One of the things I noticed about Bayern recently is how much they work in pressing their opponents to recover possession - it's relentless. I think Schweini still sees the way Bayern played perhaps as THE way, and does so instinctively. I'd like to see him paired with Schneiderlin and being both given instructions to press.

2923~~~
It was confusing, it was almost like bastian was told to press high and hard as soon as cazorla got the ball, but nobody else in the team followed suit. 

The problems came from that really, carrick sat very deep and bastian sprinted off which left a massive hole in midfield for ozil and then Ramsey who was floating more into midfield.

2924~~~
I only watched the first 25 minutes, but it really looked as if Basti was playing Guardiola tactics and the rest of the midfield van Gaal tactics. Which obviously sucks and shouldn't happen. It's a bit odd though, because he's normally a very disciplined player. There had to be a colossal misunderstanding somewhere, it didn't make sense at all. Whatever it was, he should have realised that he's causing way more problems than he's solving and should have stopped, acted calmly from a deeper position until the game lost its pace a bit.

What was in my opinion even more worrying, no one reacted. There's a midfield with 3 experienced players in Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Rooney and there was no communication, no together, no problem solving. And van Gaal didn't look as if he gave instructions either. For almost half an hour, no one did anything to change what was going wrong. It was surreal to watch. It happens, that players have a bad day and that the manager gets the tactics wrong and it's never guaranteed that changes ingame help. But the indifference from the whole United team and coaching staff to it all was so so weird to see.

2925~~~
I think this comes of Rooney being captain. Like so many English players, he has no game intelligence (see also English national team where our players struggle with the lack of foreigners in the team). Agree that nothing coming from the coach is worrying though.

Schweini should be our captain for the next 2 - 3 years and hopefully some of the game intelligence he has will rub off on whoever becomes our next captain.

2926~~~
He didn't show much intelligence in the game against Arsenal though <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. Maybe he's a bit overmotivated, too excited and wants to do too much in that box to box role. It really looked as if he wanted to do everything and forgot to do the basics first and that's not really like him.

I've defended Rooney a bit in the past because I like him a lot as a player, but yeah, he's clearly an awful captain and he's just an odd fit for the role van Gaal forces him into. I don't think Schweinsteiger needs to be captain, he never was at Bayern and only after the World Cup win became captain for Germany. It doesn't mean anything for his influence on his teammates. He's new in the team, let someone else be captain. But his role needs to be a lot clearer, a lot more defined and that's on van Gaal to do. He's better in a deeper role when the game is played in front of him anyway.

2927~~~
It's not uncommon with United under LVG, when things are bad, they are really bad and the players are visibly lost on the field and in their minds.
They are totally unable to even slightly adapt to the circumstances in order to stay within Van gaal's tactics.

2928~~~
The times today claimed Van Gaal wanted to press  Arsenal from the off which could suggest Bastian running around like a mad man but the senior players like Carrick and Rooney wanted to sit back. We were set to press, our back four was very high up the pitch but Carrick, Rooney weren't putting any pressure on the ball and our wingers were very advanced. Was a disaster really.

2929~~~
You sir, are an idiot. i dont know where to start with this. The game plan was to press high, Neville even said seconds before kick off look how high united's line is from kick off, set up to press. WATCH IT AGAIN. What LVG said afterwards was he didnt want Arsenal having time on the ball letting them decide their passes. While the tactics were questionable he was doing exactly what was asked, wheras people like Rooney/Carrick went hiding, likely with years of beating Arsenal on the counter firmly etched in their heads

2930~~~
exactly, as i replied to the above. But Neville singled out BS who was following instruction, while he gave the white Pele a free pass. Why was he so far ahead of the number 10? because he was doing his job for him

2931~~~
I think the instructions were to press as we press every single game pretty much we never sit back and defend. Our team was like split in two minds, half of them pressing, while half of them with experience against arsenal deciding to sit back and defend against them to try and soak up pressure. Definitely think the instructions were to press though so that split of opinions made it a bit of a disaster.

2932~~~
You need to read my post again, although I can see how you misread it. My criticism there was for Carrick (who I have a problem in general tbh i.e during a lot of his career here). However, it doesn't negate that Schweini's pressing was too gung-ho; not the first phase that possibly was by instruction but after going 1, 2 or 3-0 down. It's not his 'responsibility' to manage the team and give instructions but he should have shown a bit of composure even in that chaos.

2933~~~
I'm not sure how this happened, but he's my lowest rated player at 5.5 - not that far behind the Caf average.

I'm underwhelmed by what I've seen from him so far - other than the a few phases of some games where he seems to come alive and pull the strings. Hasn't been consistent enough for me.

2934~~~
He's like an old, not particularly good looking Italian sportscar with a rather fragile, ever worsening engine. It was great once and you love to own it, but you know it won't win you races anymore, even if it shows occasional glimpses of brilliance.

2935~~~
The team hasn't really performed well this season so I'm not surprised that his rating isn't high. We've also struggled with the #10 role, and prior to acquiring Martial, with the #9 role. We are playing an AMC on the right wing, which has meant newboy Darmian has had to cover that whole side by himself. The team lacks balance. 

Only a handful of players have had a decent season so far: de Gea beause he's world class and shows it time and again, Smalling as he's stepped up and is playing like a man possessed and Martial, who is the business. Everyone else has been mediocre (even Mata who's still got good stats). 

I think Schweinsteiger has shown that he is far from being over the hill, he's got class Carrick can only dream of, and he's got experience no one else in the team has - a proven winner. Once Louis finally gets the balance of the team right, his class will show consistently.

2938~~~
Yeah god knows what happened to German football that they have a "not particularly good looking Italian sportscar with a rather fragile, ever worsening engine" as their captain and their first team player. Sack Low, retire Schweinsteiger. Amirite?

2939~~~
It is stupid to blame a player when the whole system (or the match plan) has not been working. Schweinsteiger, when fit (and that he is right now), has a lot of abilities but weaknesses, too - like about every other player does. He never was the fastest and most dynamic player - that is why he was not very successful on the wing and his big career really started with the move in the center. Too me he does not look worse than he has two or three years ago - but the match plan, the working system, the performances of others are important, too. 

That Bayern was not really working on keeping him (or that he was reluctant to stay) had a lot more to do with the system of Bayern and other players being more compatible to each other and his special role in Bayern as being undroppable (somewhat a similar role Rooney has at United). I am not sure if he would have wanted to leave if he would have still played the key role he has played in the team during the Heynckes period - but then Bayern would have been a lot more keen to keep him.

2940~~~
I'm going to give you benefit of the doubt as you're a Bayern fan (and thus you've probably seen more games/minutes of his career than me) but he is undoubtedly Utd's most talented midfielder at this point of time (along with Herrera, who brings different qualities). 

Bastian's got it right below

I hope not but it could be like an ADM thing. Crazy talented player that doesn't work for LVG (not Utd) but I don't think that's going to happen. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Carrick is a passenger and it doesn't matter who is playing (of a two) but we can't have a long term plan without a 3 man midfield (Rooney absolutely does not count).

2941~~~
He seems like such a class act on and off the field. Couldn't be happier that we signed him.

2942~~~
No he didn't. He specifically said that it should be Rooney who should be pressuring Cazorla and said that he should be doing better.

2943~~~
It was tongue in cheek to fcbforever's post, which was nothing short of ridiculous as Schweinsteiger was playing really well after he took a few games to settle in, and all you have to see are some the post-match reactions on this very thread. He has controlled games for us and has been amongst our best players so far this season. And there you have fcbforever making him out to be a past it Steven Gerrard on the basis of 25 mins against Arsenal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2944~~~
Which was incorrect. Wayne should be on coquelin, bastian on cazorla and carrick on ozil.

2945~~~
Why? Coquelin was no threat whatsoever and Cazorla was playing deep. The initial point being that Neville did point out that Rooney wasn't doing enough.

2946~~~
The 10 always marks the DM or deepest midfielder, cutting off the easy out ball from defence. You wouldn't want Rooney chasing Cazorla all the way back into our half as he will always be out of position for when we counter, and plus he would be knackered. 

Carrick is the least mobile so generally sits infront of the back 4 screening, trying to mark Ozil out of the game when central. 

The problem is Cazorla on form is very difficult to mark, his quick passing is as good as anybody's and his low gravity/agility allows him to wiggle out of tight marking well. The fact is as a team we didn't follow the same plan, and that means you end up leaving big gaps like we did.

2947~~~
There's no point marking a player who offers no threat. We wouldn't mark John Obi Mikel. Cazorla was playing pretty deep and was the one causing us problems. What happened was Rooney neither offered attacking threat or helped stem the flow of Arsenal attacks. Something Neville pointed out more than once.

2948~~~
Sorry but that's just completely wrong. Just because he won't get the ball and smash it in from 30 yards doesn't mean you don't block off his passing lane and let him receive the ball easily. He is quite capable of carrying it up the pitch and then feeding an easy pass into 1 of the more attacking players.

By limiting the options out from the defence you can then force them into either hoofing the ball forward, or intercepting the ball high up. Just because Coquelin carry's little scoring threat of his own doesn't mean you don't mark him and just let him have all the time in the world.

2949~~~
No team in the world marks a player as limited as Coquelin. If you want to mark players you do it with people that can hurt you.

2950~~~
I am not saying Rooney is man marking him all over the pitch? but when Arsenals defence/goalkeeper has the ball he simply stands infront of Coquelin between the defence and him and blocks the pass into his feet. Can you not understand why that helps?

2951~~~
I've never referreed to the Arsenal game. Just about his general situation.
And it's just true that while he is still capable of very good performances, he can't do it on a regular basis anymore as the center of a top team. He is, as someone pointed out, Germanys captain, yes. And he's a leader we probably need on the pitch sometimes.
But as someone else just said, I've seen a tad more minuted of him than you lot have.
I'm not saying he's past it, but that it will be difficult to reliably form a team around him.
I don't think he can offer that anymore and his first few month in Manchester seem to confirm that.
He should be an adition to a top team, not the center of one.

I love him to bits and from the very beginning of this move I feared that it would do him no good.
I can understand he wanted to experience something different, but it was maybe too late.
You know, I love the fact that everywhere outside of Germany Schweinsteiger seems to have gotten the recognition and standing he should've had in Germany from at least 2010 on. A lot of people still doubted him over here, till our Champions League win or even the World Cup win, because of his immaturity and his winger career prior to 2009.
I fear this move will shatter his legacy and reputation internationally, because that's the first time a lot of people really see him on a regular basis, expect him to do something great which he might not be able to deliever anymore. And it would really be a shame if the world at the end of his career would think: "yeah, good player, but couldn't make it at Manchester and in the Prem."
Because he could've done it, but a few years prior to his move.

2952~~~
I actually think the move has raised his profile significantly. His problems do not stem from being past it (or like you say, no longer able to be an integral part of a team) but rather from being part of a team that is still in the making, where a manager has not found his first 11 nor even the system to get the best out of his team. Contrary to what you say, despite your confessed love for him and years of observing him, I think Schweinsteiger has already shown that he has got class United have not had in midfield since Scholes could still do the business. We are talking years, and for a top club that is kind of mad. 

Isn't it better for him to be at a club that is just as big (or bigger), that has a much bigger profile (though the footie is not as good!) where he will play when fit, as oppose to be back in Munchen with a coach who doesn't really fancy him? In Manchester he is loved. 

When Louis finally gets things going, Schweinsteiger will be at the heart of it.

2953~~~
Not really because they are always going to have a spare man who can do what you describe. What's stopping a defender from doing what you describe Coquelin could do?

2954~~~
That is extremely harsh and he hasn't been as underwhelming as you are painting him out to be. Even in the early games when his match fitness wasn't up to the mark, you could see the sheer influence he wielded on the team when he was making 30 mins cameos. After he took some time to settle in, he was more or less at the heart of our play and is arguably our top 3-4 players thus far alongside Shaw, Smalling and Mata. Most certainly our most influential in terms of how pivotal he is when it comes to running the game and leaving his mark on the way the team functions.

He had a bad game against Arsenal, but it wasn't due to him being past it or being physically unable to cope with the game either. It was due to a tactical error/misunderstanding or maybe even overzealousness on his part, although that is highly unlikely given his experience. I'd say this though, he was probably the only player who showed any fire and willingness to get back into the game whilst other experienced leaders like Carrick and Rooney went into their shells and were overly passive for my liking. Which was why it irked me to no ends, when you were painting him out to be a physically or even mentally past it player. Just look at the monstrous 90 minute master-class against Liverpool, a display which some posters claimed was Roy Keane-esque. Or how the team capitulated when he was subbed off against Wolfsburg without someone to stem the tide and bring both composure and authority to midfield.

Only fools would think that. He was arguably the world's best midfielder when Bayern were winning all those trophies and was absolutely magnificent for Germany and the heart beat of the team in WC 2010. That WC 2014 final display more or less confirmed his legacy as one of the greatest midfielders of all time. Also I think most United fans are realistic and aren't expecting the 2009-2012 version of Schweinsteiger to turn up here. We appreciate the sheer class he has and sometimes go overboard in praise of him but I honestly can't see his legacy being tarnished here, if that's what you are worried about.

2955~~~
Schweinsteiger only had a bad game against Arsenal because of van Gaal's foolish tactics. Why did he have Bastian pressing so much? It's quite clear he doesn't have the pace and legs to get up and down the field. Schneiderlin would've been more suited to that role. Schweinsteiger has been excellent for us so far and he's one of the best midfielders in the league. A class act.

And it's funny how these people think Schweinsteiger is past it. Was only last year where the whole world were praising him for his heroic performances for Germany. He's not past it, far from it. He's an instrumental player when playing deep.

2956~~~
To be honest, if we are talking about central midfielders here, a lot of players would've pulled that trick.
I do understand that a lot of people here really want him to succeed, but doubts should be allowed. He is very, very injury prone recently and on the wrong side of 30.

2957~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79117, @fcbforever" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79117/">@fcbforever</a> 

Are you Raimund Hinko? <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2958~~~
It's a lot more risky for a central defender to carry the ball forward, risking leaving a big hole in defence and a defender 1v1 with a striker. Not to mention central defenders comfortable enough with the ball are very rare - hence the best are usually highly rated. It's exactly why he uses blind as a CB.

2959~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2960~~~
Is injured and cannot play tonight.

2961~~~
Schweinsteiger injured for an international match during the season? Stop the press!

2962~~~
Jesus wept, I can't believe the twitter account of the German NT is called Die Mannschaft.

2963~~~
Always reminds me of that Simpsons scene where Sideshow Bob shows his "Die Bart Die" tattoo...

2964~~~
Injured? When? With the national team?

2965~~~
He just has muscle stiffness in his adductor, during the last training session for the national team.

2966~~~
Ah so not serious then. Need him for Everton although will he start? Schneiderlin will surely.

Thanks anyway

2967~~~
Schweinsteiger-Schneiderlin should start, with hopefully Herrera ahead of them but Rooney will probably play there.

2968~~~
There is already the possibility that he can play Sunday again. So it seems to be nothing serious.

2969~~~
Phew, Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger must play together against Everton, by far our most balanced midfield for the big games.

2970~~~
just seen something on twitter to say he got injured last night. that true?

2971~~~
No, not last night. Happened during the last training session, but nothing serious (musle stiffness). Should play the next game for Germany.

2972~~~
Is in the normal training today. In full wintergear - with cap, scarve and gloves - but I guess that is just smart.

2973~~~
Solid game from him today, seemed a bit tetchy.

2974~~~
Him and Schneiderlin are by far the best duo we have, in my opinion. And they are far better then Herrara is in the number 10 position over Rooney.

2975~~~
Decent game, nothing amazing but kept things ticking.

2976~~~
I think he's taken to the league brilliantly overall. He's played for one club in one country all of his career and making a move to a frantic Premier League, to a big club that's rebuilding, was brave.

Yet he quietly gets about his business. He's a second captain for us on the field and keeps the midfield ticking over very successfully. When you consider the fee this looks like a phenomenal piece of transfer business.

2977~~~
I'll continue to eat crow, he's giving us a lot of stability at the back.

2978~~~
Him ignoring the whistle totally fecked Everton trying to take that free kick quickly. Such a pointless stoppage as well.

Don't care who wears the armband. It's clear who the leader is out there when Schweinsteiger is on the pitch. He and Smalling play more like captains than Rooney does.

2979~~~
He's done great job today, they tried to man-mark him out with Barkley who was interchanging with McCarthy (depending where BS positioned himself), he's got incredibly calming aura surrounding him and other players and he's a great midfield general, somebody we've lacked.

2980~~~
He simply makes the players around him better. He is miles better than Carrick.

2981~~~
The wealth of experience he brings is fecking incredible. Midfield battle was over once we got that second goal.

2982~~~
He isn't. Both players bring the best out of others around them.

2983~~~
Carrick is nowhere near Schweinsteiger's composure. His distribution is also excellent, but he's not as relaxed on the ball when under pressure, does not have anywhere near the same level of technique and I doubt he has the same level of energy (though they both tire in the 2nd half when they start). Carrick is a very good player but Schweinsteiger was - and still could be - world class.

2984~~~
I would disagree but then I wouldn't expect a poster called Bastian to be completely objective on the matter. At his best and at a peak fitness he was a better player certainly but there's not much between them now. And let's not forget Carrick has a few years on Schweinsteiger.

2985~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20951, @acnumber9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20951/">@acnumber9</a> 
Well, the alias may mean this or that, but just judging it on what I've seen this season I think we'd do a lot worse without Schweinsteiger than without Carrick. Granted, Carrick is older, and it shows. I just think the midfield 3 (with Herrera connecting attack and midfield) should be our default picks, seems so obvious. Carrick can replace Schweinsteiger when he's tired.

2986~~~
It means you signed up with the username after we signed him. It's fairly obvious you're going to have that belief. If you watched us last season you'll see the difference not having Carrick made to us. Obviously Schweinsteiger being just as good means we don't have that same problem any longer.

2987~~~
Schweinsteiger <i>is </i>the better player, in his defence.

2988~~~
Schweinsteiger is the leader on the pitch. He makes everything tick and the players around him seem to respond.

2989~~~
It's not even really in question.

2990~~~
He certainly was. He clearly isn't quite as good as he used to be due to fitness. Saying he's miles better is ridiculous especially coming from somebody who only signed up when we bought him.

2991~~~
Yeah, miles better is definitely pushing it. On the ball there isn't a great deal between them at all, if only an added bit of niftiness under pressure.

Upstairs, I think there is a huge difference, however.

2992~~~
Good display again, only thing I can pick out is he needs to stay in position at times. He was all over the place against Arsenal and then today when he was filling in for Jones he just fecked off back into midfield trying to press. It left Smalling in the box alone with Lukaku and Naismith wide open. If they would have put a ball through we would have been screwed. Alright he isn't a CB but if he is going to cover for Jones then he needs to cover.

2993~~~
Such a fecking great player. Even now I pinch myself sometimes when I see him in red.

2994~~~
I love him, would love him even more if he convinces Gundogan and Hummels to join. We need more Germans and Spaniards <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2995~~~
Before he played for us I thought of him as the very best in his position, I still do. I don't care about the stage of his career or any other nonsense, seeing him play for United is superb and he loves United. Hope we can win something big with him. Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

2996~~~
I totally agree with the bolded part. He plays like a boss, his experience is only a bonus in a position where he plays and experience only comes with age. I really don't get this "fitness" thing, he can play 90 min and he showed it already, he also played 2 times a week for us.

2997~~~
He's a winner. We need those.

2998~~~
That's a fair point actually about mentality/intelligence because Schweini uses all of his ability with his bravery on AND off the ball. The thing about 'if only an added bit' of calmness under pressure is actually a big deal for me. Peak Carrick might had been fine being under pressure/when pressed/having someone on his back but that was a 2-3 year period at best. His whole playing style and career with us imo shows he is not a great player under pressure and subsequently plays like that i.e he removes himself as an option in those really tight situations.

Schweini (and your Herreras, Fellanis, Valencias, Matas) consistently offer themselves in unfavourable situatons and are able to do something good with it (recycle possession forwards, turn on the ball, play a forward ball etc). Carrick simply does not or certainly not enough of it.

Schweini is easily another level better imo.

2999~~~
Funny I thought he was man of the match today. Surprised no-one else thought so.

3000~~~
Carrick is a great player and he gets a lot of shit from a few United fans, which is completely undeserved. But it's no slight on him if he comes as second best to Schweinsteiger though and there's no need to be defensive. He's not 'miles better' than Carrick, but it's also needless to say Schweinsteiger isn't quiet good as he used to be. Both are great players and I'm glad to have both of them playing in our team, but Schweinsteiger is clearly the better player and is clearly visible. Not miles, but clearly better.

3001~~~
Yep, I agree. That calmness under pressure comes as a result of Schweinsteiger's personality and leadership. Passing and first touch, and technical things like that, are a much of a muchness to a certain degree. The pair of them are great footballers. 

The overwhelming difference between them is that Bastian has left his mark on the game more often and more consistently over the course of his career. For me, mentality is the biggest reason for that. It's why one was indisputably one of the best midfielders in world football while the other one was not.

3002~~~
Yep me also he's the best midfielder in the league by a country mile imo

3003~~~
I would agree with this. Just wait for him to load that right foot <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3004~~~
He isn't as good as he once was though. I'm not saying he isn't still a very good player because he is. The statement I replied to was stupid though. Carrick is more than capable of putting in the performances Schweinsteiger has this season.

3005~~~
Well, nobody is the same player they were two years ago, especially players who are pushing 30 and above. Applies for Rolando/Messi/Carrick. 

Not sure if Carrick can do the same of what Schweinsteiger is doing, at least not this effectively.

3006~~~
This guy oozes class.  Giving instructions all over and a very calming influences on the pitch.  Captain de facto

3007~~~
Considering he is coming back from a slight injury, this was a good performance from him. Really hoping Carrick can pull his socks and we can bench Bastian against CSKA to keep him fresh against City. 25-30 mins against CSKA should be a good run for him.

3008~~~
I wish someone had highlights of him (or the match)

3009~~~
When things work his way, he's just brilliant and so clever

3010~~~
You are dead wrong in regards to Carrick imo

3011~~~
Unbelievable yesterday.  Did he give the ball away at all?

3012~~~
For sure <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3013~~~
What a player!! Calm and composed.. He ll start the CSKA match for sure,hopefully will get taken off early after we get a couple of goals and we can give him rest till the weekend!!

3014~~~
I hope we rest him to be honest. Think Carrick next to Schneiderlin is good enought to start, that combination gets labelled as too defensive but we're away in Europe so it's probably the best time to play it. I'd rather have Bastian fresh for the derby at the weekend where his leadership will be key. 

He does a good job of battening down the hatches so ideally we should give him 20 minutes at the end of the CSKA match.

3015~~~
Saw him telling Smalling and Jones to push wider at one point in the first half. Such a smart player, really beneficial to have him around some of the younger guys.

3016~~~
He reminds me of Roy Keane in that he is so vocal as a captain on the pitch. He is such a born leader. There was a point in the first half when Smalling and Jones seemed to be advancing a bit and BFS simply just told 'em off. Asked them where exactly they should be holding their positions. So refreshing to see a midfield general again.

3017~~~
He is the real boss on the pitch, and rightly so.

3018~~~
Class performance, but I was disappointed with him vs Arsenal and would want to see how he does vs a weakened City side before calling him best in the league and all that. He's had some outstanding performances but also quite some lesser ones.

3019~~~
More like Bosstian amirite

3020~~~
I would rather bastian in the team with morgan and herrera than carrick, yes bastian is in his early 30's, but lets be honest carrick 35 pushing 36, would rather bastian in the team. Who offers experience, leadership and is just a upgrade over carrick now

3021~~~
He was let down incredibly by those around him against Arsenal.

I am not saying he played well, but he wasn't at fault for the pathetic performances in defence and and the rest of midfield.

3022~~~
Go to fullmatchesandshows.com and bookmark the page. 

After about 4 hours, they upload the full match and different highlight versions. You never have to ask for this again.

3023~~~
Thanks, I'll check it out! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3024~~~
He was all over the place and completely abandoned his position, of course he was at fault. He has been great but it doesn't make him exempt from criticism.

3025~~~
I disagree. To me he was fulfilling to Scheiderlin role in the side. Carrick tends to sit and Morgan usually presses right alongside the striker. Schweinsteiger was doing that, the problem is that he doesn't have the legs.

Schweinsteiger is far too long in the tooth to be abandoning his position on a whim. These were our tactics. The wrong ones, granted, but he was doing what the manager wanted.

3026~~~
Schneiderlin never just abandons the midfield and tries to press CBs by himself. We were playing two strikers anyway so there was no need for him to do it. He was also chasing the ball out wide and everywhere but in the midfield. He also abandoned his position yesterday when he was filling in at CB so I'll have to disagree that he is somehow to good to abandon his position. The tactics were to play with no midfield? I'm not buying that.

3027~~~
Schneiderlin presses hard and bypasses Rooney in most games we play. On occasions he's been the one pressing the goalkeeper, infact. Our second striker tends to drop back in when he does this.

The tactics clearly weren't "abandon the midfield," but one midfielder pressing higher than the other is obvious as we've been doing it all season. 

I don't know what you're referring to about centre back yesterday?

3028~~~
What are they singing?

3029~~~
he's very good.

3030~~~
Was he this active on social media at Bayern? He seems to be going above and beyond to form an attachment with the fans so far with United. 

What a man.

3031~~~
He is more active than he used to be - but he might have more time in England for that now than he had in Munich where he had his full social life. Martinez told last week that he is phoning with him very often.

3032~~~
I'm sorry but Schweinsteiger was and still is in another league to Carrick, that's no slight on Carrick but it's bonkers to think they were ever comparable. Carrick is as criminally overrated as he is under at times.

3033~~~
Thought he looked a bit off tonight.

3034~~~
I was surprised he started. Thought he'd rotate with Carrick to keep him fresh.

3035~~~
His stats look ok. Thought he was overly safe in his passing, as were most of the team in the first half. Hardly any imagination from anyone. Didn't notice many runs off the ball, with the exception of Lingard, so perhaps that explains the predictable passing.

3036~~~
That and the fact that he himself stands still after every pass.

3037~~~
Probably told to conserve energy when he could for the weekend. We came for a draw.

3038~~~
Thought he played pretty well but he got subbed off for a bit of a rest before City and also so we can start going long to Fellaini if needed.

3039~~~
Did anyone else get offended on his behalf when Owen said Carrick should be first choice over him? I'm generally a big Carrick supporter, but he's never been quite at Schweinsteiger's level, and now that Schweinsteiger is just past his prime and Carrick is well past his, it's not that close.

3040~~~
Carrick is usually useless until Christmas. I won't count him out for the season yet. But yes, Bastian is simply better, period

3041~~~
Agreed on both counts. We may need the usual post-winter Carrick brilliance if Schweinsteiger has injury problems.

3042~~~
Carrick has never been as good as Schweinsteiger. For me this season he's been one of our worst players.

Schweinsteiger looked a bit off last night which is obviously why he was taken off. I do prefer to start with him and Schneiderlin for the City game.

3043~~~
Owen generally has his tongue stuck up Carrick's arse.

3044~~~
I think had we seen a more in form Carrick this season then the argument wouldn't be straight forward. 

As it happens Carrick has been pretty bad this season so far, so yeah feck you Michael Owen! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3045~~~
Carrik was better last season than Schcweinsteiger has been so far. We can't just ignore the fact that he is having as many poor games as good games currently.

3046~~~
I'm not sure how to view him today, he did give the ball away a few times but I think he was tasked with being the creator so the risks that carries are that you'll give 2 or 3 over hit ones, his composure on the ball deeper though was important in us controlling the game.

3047~~~
A good game, but a few shaky moments. His pressing was instrumental to us controlling the midfield.

3048~~~
He plays it too safe for my liking. Carrick's not been in good form this season but even in less game time he's played more penetrative passes. Schweinsteiger controls the game brilliantly but I think we should be asking more of him.

3049~~~
Well, he didn't really create anything, so that shouldn't be a valid excuse. He was average today.

3050~~~
He is no Paul Scholes, that's for sure.

3051~~~
Too safe, but a great fighter. I would prefer if he shoots more and goes for the killer pass at times, today too many touches and just passing it around to death.

3052~~~
That Schmidfield + Ander could be supersolid and crative enough for midtable and lowertable teams but when it's played at higher tempo, he struggles a bit. Maybe we should rotate them even more with Carrick who would have been fresher today, maybe drop both for Fellaini, we played some lovely football with last year. I'd rest them both next game Carrick and Basti.

3053~~~
Poor recently after a good start, no ambition in his passing today at all. Carrick used to get stick for passing sideways and backwards but Bastian took it to a new level this afternoon.

3054~~~
We usually play better without him.

3055~~~
Seems a yard or two slower than I thought he'd be, having said that it's hardly a surprise given Bayern allowed him to leave. They wouldn't allow a peak condition Schweinstieger leave, we've got the shot legged on the decline version. 

Given all that I still feel his experience is going to be huge during the season ahead.

3056~~~
This thread is hilarious, just look before and after the man City thread mark. 

Before threadmark = awesome midfielder 
After threadmark = poor form

3057~~~
Thought he was good. Don't know what guys are on about.

3058~~~
Schweinsteiger is playing the role that Van Gaal demands perfectly. He controls the game and gives us the solid base and pressing to win the ball back instantly. 

We seem to be happy to control games and play cautiously to try and nick a goal and three points, which I am fine with away from home or against the better teams, but we cannot continue like this when we concede. If we go a goal down, I want to see Schweinsteiger taken off and a more attacking midfielder come on - we look a decent threat with Schneiderlin anchoring and two others (currently Herrera and Fellaini) going forward. I'd like to see Pereira given a chance centrally, when we need a goal at least. We need pace and Schweinsteiger can't give us that, but there really is nobody better at controlling a game.

3059~~~
I was happy to see him running with the ball at times, something he definitely can bring to games that Carrick doesnt. However he can be very frustrating with his passing, 83% is pretty low for the kind of pass selection he makes

3060~~~
Such a great player but...he's past it ain't he?

3061~~~
He was average in the last 3 games.

3062~~~
He was brilliant today. Some of you need to pay attention to the game.

3063~~~
I'm amazed. He was very effective today and did his job almost perfectly. 

What the hell are you lot expecting from him? Maybe a goal would have been nice but he did everything else. 

Him and Schneiderlin are a great partnership.

3064~~~
I must have watched a different game to some of the posters above. I thought he was fine. 7/10 performance

Only issue I have is that he looked spent when he was subbed off.

3065~~~
I agree with the posters on here who say he's being too safe. He needs to take more risks: go for more key passes and take more shots on goal.

3066~~~
I'm with the minority here today. I thought he had a very good game.

He's one of them players, excellent to watch with the ball at his feet. Every time the ball is passed to him, he looks up, knows what his next move is, and executes it.
His passing may look simple, but it's what he does before the pass, he takes the player out of the game before he passes

3067~~~
isn't that what people say about the whole team and philosophy?

3068~~~
We need his calming influence when people like Jones are in the side.

3069~~~
From being at the game, he ran us in the second half. There was a period where we just kept getting the ball back of City every time, and it was thanks to him. You can see hes such a good leader on the pitch. He had a few misplaced passes, but other than that, you can also see he has a great understanding with Morgan.

3070~~~
He bossed it today. I think people were expecting a different kind of player going by some of the comments. I love the way he pushes forward in that left-hand channel and always seems to be available for the ball.

3071~~~
He was good today. Not his best outing but he helped us dominate and keep pressure on them, especially in the second half. Not sure what some of you were watching but he was just fine today. That midfield three did very well and most mid fields would be overrun by City's power and speed.

3072~~~
I thought he was quite good. He did give the ball away at times but his passing helped us gain control in midfield.

3073~~~
This! Don't know why the moaning here. Bossed that midfield with Morgan and controlled the game for us in the midfield. Kept closing the opposition. Decent game from him.

3074~~~
Yeah but the counter argument is that we're not good enough technically (and we give the ball away).  In Schweinsteiger's case, he can definitely afford to be a bit more risky. The pros would outweigh the cons.

3075~~~
I will admit that I've been slightly underwhelmed by Bastian so far.

I think he is putting in solid 6/10 performances, but certainly not hitting the heights I'd expect from him, just yet anyway.

No doubt he still has the quality, but just expected a tad more that's all.

3076~~~
fecking hell, do people not remember when our midfield was incapable of stringing together five passes, too slow to press and win back the ball and regularly taken to task by teams sat just above the relegation places?

Our midfield right now is light years ahead of anything we've seen here in almost ten years. It controls games with such an ease I think people are beginning to take it for granted. Schweinsteiger's arrival, alongside Schneiderlin, is a big part of the reason why we can go to places like Goodison Park, or away to Moscow, and completely dominate the ball.

Our team is a major work in progress but we should call out the positives when they are there. Our midfield is very good, and does what the managers demands to a tee.

3077~~~
His calmness in playing out of the back under pressure is almost like playing FIFA 16. Such a boss. Its like he pops 4 valiums before every game.

3078~~~
He seems to play the same terrible lobbed pass over the top about 3 times per game. Apart from that he's been fine.

3079~~~
One moment in the last game summed it up for me. He had made himself space for a perfect shot instead he decided to try and slide someone in. That's not the Schweinsteiger I want to see

3080~~~
Is it just me or does his technique occasionally let him down for no apparent reason? Like he'll scuff a pass or miss hit a through ball for no apparent reason. Its not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, its just a bit strange. 

He also needs to stop trying to dribble past people with skill, because he can't do it. At all.

3081~~~
I think it's not just coincidence that every player on here bar De Gea and the centerbacks has been criticized for his offensive contribution and not risking more. This is the way Van Gaal wants to play - one either agrees or disagrees with it but there's no point in slagging off the individual players for it.

3082~~~
He plays like Brian McClair used to in reserve games in 1997. He's obviously a step above a lot of the players, but he never takes shots, he's always looking to help other people along and then he gets a stitch after 65 minutes. I'm begging for a bit of selfishness from him.

3083~~~
This!

3084~~~
I don't think he can be expected to start 2 games a week. I understand why LvG wants him to. But rather than looking stronger for having built up match fitness, it just looks like he's being run into the ground.

3085~~~
10 games in and I cannot recall him ever taking a shot for us.

Have a go Bastian, seems like he's way too caught up on possession retention instructions.

3086~~~
He's not the only player we've criticised by and large for a lack of balls, so to speak offensively, its clearly a tactical instruction being given to the squad as a whole by the coaching staff.

Safe possession is the defining theme of this united team we are watching grow, for a better or for worse its here to stay until we improve our offensive options to add that fluidity that other top possession sides have in their arsenal.

I think a year down the line, with another top winger and striker in the squad, and another year of learning the tactical approach I think we will see a more offensive United.

3087~~~
Some of the comments on the last couple of pages have been slightly harsh on him. I too agree to a certain extent that he does not shoot for us but that has been the case for most of our midfielders this season. No one is ready to take a shot from outside the box except Memphis. (And when Memphis does and misses, half the people here moan!!)
But I think he was bought for a purpose and that was to control the game and ensure possession remains with us. That is what LVG demands. So far he has excelled in that requirement. And it has only been 3 months, the whole season is left and I am sure he will grow in to the role. Keep in mind he has just come into full fitness in the last one month as far as I remember. I believe goals will come.

3088~~~
Ander takes shots, and personally I think some of our best stuff so far has been with the Ander and Schneiderlin partnership I wanted in the summer. A partnership that is far more direct. I appreciate why Schweinsteiger is in there, but I don't think he's been very successful at doing the things hes in there for. 86% pass completion so far this season sounds seriously short of what you'd expect from him when you see him looking for the sideways pass so very often. I'm not sure he's passed the ball any better than Carrick, who has been below par himself.

3089~~~
Schweinsteiger isn't in the side because he's a better passer than Carrick. 

Plus there's a tendency on the Caf to assess quality of passing based on its length, height and prettiness. It's why people will double check when it's claimed Fellaini is a good passer even though his ability to pass the ball forward into feet with accuracy is just as good as any other player in the squad.

3090~~~
He has been fine, came here to take the pressure of Carrick, now we have two players who can dictate play which is great.

He is on the decline though, we need to find a young player to take over the reigns.

3091~~~
Can't be bothered looking through these threads - can someone quickly explain, why do posters call him BFS? What does it stand for?

3092~~~
Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!

3093~~~
Cheers pal!

3094~~~
Just picked a BFS jersey in Istanbul for 60 lira. If you look at it close u can clearly see its fake but i don't really give a feck haha. Dude tried to sell me a Rooney one also. No chance

3095~~~
Wasn't pleased with his performance. Not influencing the game as much as I thought he would.

3096~~~
I disagree, I always feel we lose control as soon as he is subbed.

3097~~~
Lots of bluster today but not enough impact on the ball.

3098~~~
Looks like he's 40 games into a season not 10!!

3099~~~
I've been underwhelmed so far. He's obviously a good player but 0-0 score-lines don't really help us and Schweinsteiger's control of the game could easily be described as letting it drift.

3100~~~
Think he had a very poor first half. Misplaced a few passes, got on the ball quite a bit but just slows things down too much in my opinion.

3101~~~
Been poor recently but thought he did very well tonight. 

Him and Carrick were both very good.

3102~~~
[QUOTE="Kraftwerker, post: 18351059, member: 36088"<b>]Been poor recently </b>but thought he did very well tonight.

I don't think so I think he's been one of our best players so far this season

3103~~~
Ran himself into the ground. Immense work rate. Reminded me of his performance in the WC final.

3104~~~
I thought he was solid and provided good ground coverage alongside the less mobile Carrick.

3105~~~
I agree.

But last few games I've been looking for a bit more from him in terms of changing the tempo and getting the ball forward quicker.

It's Bastian Schweinsteiger, it's what he does.

A lot better tonight for me.

3106~~~
thought his performance was a bit flat last night. However, it looks to me that his instruction is to hang back and control the midfield with Carrick being invited to do the playmaking.

3107~~~
Joachim Löw said he's going to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/nationalelf/638629/artikel_laedt-loew-trapp-weigl-und-stindl-erstmals-ein.html#omsmtwkicker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rest him</a> during the international friendlies due to not having a Winter break in the Premier League. He's also going to rest Ozil and Kroos.

Good man.

3108~~~
Very sensible by Low!! Hopefully Basti will take a much needed break..

3109~~~
Where is he these days ? A bit disappointing tbh. He just passes the ball safely.

3110~~~
He is turning into our new 6/10 player

Does little wrong but doesn't exactly help in attacking situations

3111~~~
50 from 58 passes. 86.2% completion.

Almost every pass in and around the box failed. Whether delivered high and thus feeding the static WBA defence to head away or delivered low. Conclusion - there hasn't been enough movement so far from the players around him to criticise Schweini yet. Others need to step up and work harder for space to have a ball played into.

3112~~~
I still think we should line up with a CDM - CM-CAM rather than a CM-CM combination.  It's kind of static.

3113~~~
His touch was quite heavy today.

3114~~~
He's a fecking tank - slow to move and get started, but an absolute beast in midfield duels

3115~~~
I thought he did well today, was working all over the pitch and actually moved forward more often than in previous games.

3116~~~
My MOTD today, so strong when fighting for the ball.

3117~~~
His role is primarily stability in midfield rather then attacking the lines. Yes that means playing that safe ball first before that risky pass and inviting the opponent to run through the middle.

3118~~~
Keep waiting for him to play like the player I thought he would. Isn't happening for whatever reason. Needless to say that he has played a lot of minutes now. 

Dissapointing really, reminds me a little of how Ballack flattered to decieve after the hype of signing for Chelsea.

Lets hope he picks up that old form sometime.

3119~~~
So much more improved in the second half, he's absolute class.

3120~~~
I should have a go at players more often

He was immense in that 2nd half

3121~~~
He was indeed. Turned it around after a fairly average first half.

3122~~~
Fantastic in the 2nd. Thankfully he's just as good at bossing midfield duels as he is getting into shooting positions and not shooting.

3123~~~
A huge part of why we're so solid at the back. Fights for every ball throughout a game and many were questioning his fitness when we signed him!

3124~~~
I always feel like he's playing within himself but there's no question he is a huge reason for our midfield domination. Wins the ball back over and over again, constantly presses the opposition high up, rarely struggles under pressure and recycles the ball intelligently. I just think he could do more.

3125~~~
Not only he did his duty as midfielder perfectly but also provided some needed assecuration for young Jackson at the left side.

He's a natural captain in almost every aspect.

3126~~~
He plays for Manchester United.

3127~~~
He got an ungrateful role to run around Carrick, but I think he did well, second half was much better though.

3128~~~
I love him. There was a time when a United midfield couldn't complete more than three or four passes. Remember that.

3129~~~
He's one of the best big game players, so clearly he's saving himself for the CL final <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3130~~~
Strong second half, lovely control in tight areas and kept us ticking.

3131~~~
He is a General. That is all.

3132~~~
Wish we had him 3-5 years younger.

3133~~~
He's terrific and all, but why the feck he doesn't shoot at all?

3134~~~
Inspiring performance from him today, would be interested to see some stats on him, but it looked like he covered a lot of ground and he made a LOT of tackles. Just wish he would put on his shooting boots soon.

3135~~~
He's not very good at it as far as I know.

3136~~~
I thought he played really well, but where is the shots he used to hammer in from range? He just won't shoot. He had crazy long range stats on FIFA for a reason.

3137~~~
He's scored some crackers throughout his career.

Not sure why he's been reluctant to shoot at United so far.

3138~~~
Improved so much in the second half.. Has so much composure!! Knows exactly how to retain possession even when pressed by 2 players..

With Low saying he won't play him in this round of friendlies,hopefully he come back rejuvenated after the break!!

3139~~~
This, basically. Deutscher Fussballmeister indeed.

3140~~~
He will be a very popular goal scorer when he eventually gets one

OT always encouraging him to shoot

3141~~~
Was excellent today loved the tackles he was making in the second half.

3142~~~
He was closed down too quickly to pull off the shots. Didn't help that WBA could do that easily with so many men in and around their box.

3143~~~
Ask the Portuguese about that. Nevermind if it's for club or country, he always screamers against them.

3144~~~
More specifically the Germal couple behind me at the match. Shows how bad my memory is, I've already forgotten the German word for shoot.

3145~~~
Didn't shy away from Pulis' fouling machines taking skin off everyone who came near them. He gave it back in spades whilst still playing football. He's tough as old boots.

3146~~~
Been pretty negative about him of late, I have to hold up both my hands and admit, he's improved a great deal in the last two games.

3147~~~
We haven't had a battler like this in midfield since Roy Keane was shown the door

3148~~~
Das Shoot ?

3149~~~
<a class="username" data-user="56559, @Tillo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56559/">@Tillo</a> from the newbz helped me out:

shoot! - schiess! (sheess!)
have a go, ffs - zieh ab! (tsee up!)

It's OT, it's gonna be the second one for sure.

Edit: <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I just got it.

3150~~~
Was nice to see him throw himself about the pitch. Another solid performance. Bargain.

3151~~~
#LikeABoss today!

3152~~~
He is fecking brave. 

How brave he is you can see when you compare Bayern matches with United matches. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> Thanks Basti for leaving the best club in the world to fight this battle with us.

3153~~~
His refusal to shoot confuses me because he's been shooting from range for a decade. Is he worried about his hammy?

3154~~~
Huge respect to him for that. Is a legend in Bayern and had it all there. Joins us was brave of him. My favourite player.

3155~~~
He was our best player today, in my opinion.

3156~~~
Probably side pass Louis as told him not to

3157~~~
Yeah that's bullshit.

3158~~~
He's brilliant at controlling the midfield and dictating the game. But there is that nagging feeling that I want more. A bit more 'star' quality if you like.

Also, his long range passing is wank. He constantly shanks the ball or miss hits it. I wasn't expecting that at all <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3159~~~
I'm not surprised. Pointless long range passing seems to be a contractual obligation here at United. And still the fecking nutters in the crowd gasp as one of our players blasts the ball out wide for the tenth time in the game.

I'm half joking, but there's a bizarre inclination on this forum - and perhaps in general - to assess the quality of passing based on its range.

I can't think of another football team that hits so many of these kind of balls out wide. I expect Bastian to have mastered this in no time at all.

3160~~~
I wish he'd fecking shoot once in a while.

3161~~~
Just oozes class, incredible player.

3162~~~
Have you ever been pleased about anything? Serious question.

3163~~~
I'm inclined to agree. The raking diagonals often do very little to instigate or continue attacks. Schneiderlin is another subscriber to the long ranger out wide right.

3164~~~
Yep, and I don't remember him hitting too many of them while at Southampton either. We didn't buy him for that and it's not the kind of thing that makes him the quality midfielder he is.

3165~~~
He's a warrior. Even if he isn't on top of his game I love how he's up for the midfield scrap.

3166~~~
Loved how he was immediately tracking back to help out CBJ against Sessegnon and Dawson. He was everywhere in the 2nd half, winning the ball back or taking up great positions in attack!

3167~~~
Thinking I should watch the match again. I was surprised when I saw his average rating. I thought he was solid, but nothing overly special.

3168~~~
LVG has overworked him these last 6 weeks in my opinion. Although a fantastic competitor he looks a bit knackered and need to remember he's been plagued by injuries the last 2 years, he's in a new league that is a lot more intense and he's in his 30's. Give Basti occasional rests and watch how much better he'll be for it

3169~~~
Literally in the post you just quoted.

3170~~~
Nah, he scored some crackers in his career so far. I hope he's given the green light to have a go with his ability.

I would love to see him take direct free kick duties when he can as well.

3171~~~
General Schweinsteiger! Fecking calm as ice. Bosses that midfield duels with ease. He and Morgan have had a huge role in that defensive run of ours. Loves breaking down game and keeps possession. LVG's dream midfielder. He really needs to find his shooting boots though. High time he starts shooting. I am going crazy and waiting for his first goal for us. I am going to go bat-shit crazy! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3172~~~
It should be Field Marshall Schweinstieger! <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

3173~~~
Pogba just sat Bastian down



Also,



Presume Ronaldo and Messi are 1 and 2.

3174~~~
that shirt is expensive aswell

3175~~~
Stay safe Bastian!!

3176~~~
He's not injured right?

3177~~~
He's playing? I thought Löw was going to let him rest during the international break.

3178~~~
Reminds me of Messi vs Boateng.

Anyway, hope everyone at the game, including himself arrive home safely.

3179~~~
Okay I can live with that.

But every-time someone bumps someone's thread during an international break I worry about injuries.

3180~~~
Martial №1, surely

3181~~~
That has got to be bs, Depay n°3 ??? For real ?

3182~~~
The German national team will meet tomorrow again and play on Tuesday night vs the Netherlands - but Löw gives some players like Schweinsteiger a rest.

3183~~~
im one of his biggest fans here but he is very poor today, hopefully he ups his game in the second half.....

3184~~~
Wonder if we can put the myth about his body to bed?

Plenty enough pace, physically as strong as anyone, engines still there.

Puts a lie to the myth of the physical wreck we apparently bought every time he steps out on the pitch.

3185~~~
Average and even surprisingly sloppy at times today.

3186~~~
Sloppy mistakes. But he saved Young's skin.

3187~~~
Good defensively, sloppy in possession.

3188~~~
Oh what a beauty!

3189~~~
What way to score his first goal for us. The mans a winner

3190~~~
You Big Beautiful German Bastard!

3191~~~
Fußballgott. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3192~~~
Showed the most energy of all players after the equalizer. Really cool on the ball and gave that finish that extra second instead of blazting it into the sky.

3193~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3194~~~
Was one of our worst players but all is forgotten <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Feels like the good old United

3195~~~
Outrageous to call that an own goal. He played it in off their man. Credit should be given.

3196~~~
Awful today but still great that he 'scored' <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Have to wait a little longer for Bastian's first goal though.

3197~~~
He is like a bulldozer at times this guy. Great drive. Reactions look slower than they once were though.

3198~~~
Almost as if he ... passed it towards him, you could say.

3199~~~
That's his goal. Shot was on target.

Edit: maybe not

3200~~~
Poor again.

3201~~~
Legend. Massive goal.

3202~~~
A World cup winner celebrates a goal like he's just scored on his debut. That was beautiful.

Own goal, mind.

3203~~~
I fecking love him! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I hope he gets the goal as his even though it's unlikely

3204~~~
I loved his reaction after the goal, it reminded me of Ronaldo's last minute winner at Fulham.

3205~~~
His reaction after we conceded tells you all you need to know about the man.

3206~~~
pure composure.

many players would have put that in the crowd or side netting

3207~~~
Was a bit meh all game but did a vital thing at the right time and that is all that matters in the end

3208~~~
His brain calculated the proper trajectory to bank it on off the ass of the Watford player who was sliding into the net. Was goal.

3209~~~
The general. 

Off colour on the ball today. Off it, great.

3210~~~
He was surprisingly sloppy at times but I love his mentality. Even if he has a game where he isn't the best on the ball he's always trying to win the midfield battle and pops up everywhere. Thought he reacted really well after we conceded.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What alternate universe is this in which Schweinsteiger is generally poor?

3211~~~
Not sure if ... oh whatever.

3212~~~
Massive goal for us, wasnt too good once again. At times he's excellent but then he's so sloppy/slow in thought the other moment. Surprised by his technique and skill at times though.

3213~~~
What a fecking beast. Legend of the game!!

3214~~~
Great man.

3215~~~
Well done! nice jinxing.
Cheer up we just won the fecking game.

Bastian feckING schweinstiger!<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3216~~~
One of those players that was jut born to play for United. Shit performance for 88 minutes and then shows up when needed.

3217~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3218~~~
If someone has a gif... I would appreciate it.

Hell of a man. As said in the live thread, he was unfortunate with a lot of his decisions today, but again he was nearly everywhere. His working rate is surreal. Still he can do a lot better than today.

3219~~~
Agreed. By far the most important thing about his performance today was his reaction after that goal. Really set the tone. His celebration just showed how much he wanted it too.

Need a gif of that cheeky flick in his own half too. Majestic.

3220~~~
I'm happy, just saying that he's not in very good form.

3221~~~
You get the impression he loves it here. It's only a celebration, I know, but he really <i>gets it.</i>

3222~~~
Phew I thought you were being serious. Well played, chap.

3223~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3224~~~
But haven't you heard? He's got the body of a 64 year old and his goose is cooked?

3225~~~
What a man.

3226~~~
You see how we played at 1-1 and especially BFS...he was taking risks, going past people and playing forward passes that took players out the game - why can't we play like that all the time?!

3227~~~
We've had this problem for awhile. We go through very extreme peaks and troughs in every game. Have to get rid of this and be able to perform well throughout a game more consistently.

3228~~~
He is a warrior, simple as that.

He isn't that great in possession as I expected him to be, but he is a great character on the pitch.

I seriously cannot understand how someone like van Gaal sees Rooney as better captain than him, baffling.

3229~~~
I thought he was shedding some tears during that celebration. Must have been somewhat emotional.

3230~~~
When you are ahead you dont need to take these risks. Its different when you have 4 mins left and 40 min left.

3231~~~
What a beautiful, brilliant man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3232~~~
Love the way he is constantly hassling & harrying in midfield. The injuries & formations meant that this was always going to be a disjointed performance but character's like his get us over the line.

3233~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUV-CaWWIAEcs5f.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUV-CaWWIAEcs5f.jpg:large"/>

3234~~~
Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger.

Our General.

3235~~~
Great drive and determination.

3236~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> - that face says it all.

3237~~~
Have to say I love a midfielder like this. Yeah, he's superb on the ball (usually) and all that, but he plays with real heart, and leaves everything out there on the pitch. Refreshing to see as opposed to "DMs" and "AMs" who have their specific role and don't deviate much from it.

3238~~~
First thing I said after the crazed celebration, "that's a fecking captain's goal". He is leadership personified.

3239~~~
"HES ONLY HERE FOR THE RETIREMENT MONEY"

Loved his celebration, like a young teenager making his debut scoring for his boyhood club. Not his greatest game, but maybe one of his most important contributions for us.

3240~~~
Not his best game but his mentality and composure were great, as was that celebration. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

3241~~~
I still don't believe that shot wasn't on target. that's his goal, imo.

3242~~~
His grandparents conquered our country, but his smile conquered our hearts!

3243~~~
I've still yet to fully process the fact that he plays for us. Part of me still thinks it's all some elaborate fan made video

3244~~~
lol same. mirage like

3245~~~
Thought he was poor - despite the goal at the end which was good. He is lucky that will save him from some criticism.

3246~~~
About to add a PL medal to his collection. What a fecking legend!

3247~~~
Shame about the fact that he probably won't be given the goal. Great moment.

3248~~~
It's not luck if you decide a game and hence get praise instead of criticism.

3249~~~
I'm liking the positivity.

3250~~~
That celebration <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3251~~~
It should be his goal though. it only matters if its on target, not that its going in. Keeper saving it has no bearing on the matter.

3252~~~
Was it on target though? Looked more like a cross that went across the goal.

3253~~~
I think it was. It was going across at an angle, not in a straight line.

3254~~~
They should just bin own goals and use the system they have in hockey. If your shot or cross has forced it, it's your goal, unless you Abou Diaby-it and literally smash the ball in yourself unopposed, or you pass the ball back to your goalkeeper and he slices it in. But if it's an attack which is deflected or bundled in, then give it to the attacking player.

3255~~~
The thing is with BFS's performances is that if he was a new signing that not many people had heard about, 24 years old, I would be very disappointed with his start to the season and would question if he should start in our team - don't think he has been great and isn't really what we need next to Schneiderlin or Carrick - think we need a Modric type player.

But then I remember he is BFS and he was the player that drove us when the equaliser went in, I use to think experience was very over rated but after seeing some performances last season (Leicester away) it started to hit me that we really lacked a leader and he seems to be that man.

3256~~~
Was his poorest game so far IMO but wow, the drive in this man! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/> You can see everyone else looks up to him, its like Cantona with the class of 92. Incredibly chuffed he plays for us and what a feckin celebration, I went nuts too!

3257~~~
He's our captain on the pitch. This team's been crying out for that type of leadership.

3258~~~
Should be our captain.

3259~~~
Not sure what you mean the guy oozes class his legs are not what they were granted but he's been anything but poor.

3260~~~
The goal was the mark of a captain, that's for sure.

3261~~~
I'm still calling it his winner.

3262~~~
Great work to force the ball in somehow, but apart from that, he was awful today. Like, really really bad.

3263~~~
Yep, our whole midfield was dreadful to be honest, him particularly so.

3264~~~
Just don't think he has been particularly impressive, he seems very slow on the ball at times and gets caught out especially in the high tempo away games. Saying he has been poor is a bit strong but he has been pretty average however today showed me what he really brings to the team and how important mentality is in football.

3265~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3266~~~
He looks younger... again.

3267~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/iu33B5njtjO/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

3268~~~
I thought he played well. He's vital to our pressing and and possession game. His touch was a bit off, but we were lighter in midfield without Ander once we went to 3.5.2/5.3.2 and weren't able to play as high up the pitch as we should have.

The goal is a sign of the character of Basti. His reaction to press and inject urgency was fantastic in the build up to the goal.

3269~~~
Leadership that we've missed for years.

3270~~~
Watching that,you realise how much even the younger players will look up to him..  Why wouldn't they,he is Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger!!

3271~~~
You'd never catch Rooney congratulating a team mates haircut. Give Basti the armband

3272~~~
I'm still not sure how we signed him.

3273~~~
Yup. Doesn't matter who has the armband, when he's on the pitch, he's the captain.

3274~~~
So has his goal been confirmed as an OG or not?

3275~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pilZLgdDSI8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Great video of his highlights for the season thus far. 

What a player.

3276~~~
Total mancrush!

3277~~~
Again... we haven't had a proper battler in our side since Keano was shown the door

3278~~~
Hello King Niall yes it has I can confirm for you today.

3279~~~
Much obliged peasant <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3280~~~
The guy is a total bulldozer. He doesn't play with the 'I want to kill you' intensity of Roy Keane but he won't give up on anything, totally driven. I think he really enjoys the physicality of the league.

3281~~~
Used to be box-to-box for Bayern and Ger. obviously can't do role that any longer but he is still a very good midfielder who contributes both defensively, offensively and is influential to rest of team-mates (improving everyone else's game) due to composure, charisma, experience. Great signing but we'll prob replace him in 2-3 years time with a youth player or new signing.

3282~~~
SSN have just said that he's missed training today. Along with Herrera, Carrick and Jones. There's not been any reports of an injury has there?

3283~~~
I'm weak.

3284~~~
Probably part of his recovery. Seems like his fitness levels are still not up there and he hardly plays 90mins anymore, seems knackered after 60mins

3285~~~
hes still on vction inhe? probably his worst performance n our jersey, his legs are completely gone, sub him off, let morgan anchor midfield alone, hes doing it anyway and fantastically well but basti goes missing, pereira on, it will never happen but still would hve been good sub in my view

3286~~~
He has no risk in his passing, so conservative. Sad to see.

3287~~~
I'll just keep repeating that he is no Paul Scholes. I might even add "not even close to" soon if he keeps up like this.

But I still like him, and he is not bad, I just expected much more from him.

3288~~~
He can't be happy in himself.  I won't be surprised if he retires at the end of this season, contract or no.

3289~~~
But replace him with Fellaini?  WTF

3290~~~
Even in the first half he didn't look fit to me. Think we have to be realistic about how many games he can play.

3291~~~
Swapping and subbing him and Carrick was working earlier in the season as it kept them both fresh and meant they both didnt play 90 minutes each game.

However today, we lost control of the game as soon as he went off (and fellaini came on for him). We pretty much only created once chance when he went off, we couldnt pass the ball at all. It was like we lost a leader.

Basti himself though, he looks like he struggles to run or goes out drinking the night before, not sure what it is.

3292~~~
He looks completely knackered and it's not as if he even plays 90 minutes in most games.

3293~~~
When we bought him I honestly thought he'd play a lot less than he has, he looks knackered to me.

3294~~~
Yeah he is struggling physically. Although we were clearly worse when he went off so he was contributing positively in some regard. Really need Carrick to be fit so the two can rotate and keep each other fresh.

3295~~~
It's weird isn't it, when he's on he doesn't do much but then as soon as he goes off everything turns to complete shit. We go from pointless possession to running around chasing shadows unable to keep possesion.

3296~~~
Agree with you, I thought it was really noticeable when he went off. I thought Schneiderlin had a (rare) poor game.

3297~~~
He's very underrated in our team, he dictates the game without anybody (apart from United fans) noticing.  Top class German international.

3298~~~
Never rated him as an upper tier technician, even at his peak. Scholes was much better in my opinion.

3299~~~
Give over, he slows the play down every time the ball comes to him.

He reminds me of robbo in his final days, a little overweight, slow and just plodding about the pitch.

3300~~~
It's not weird at all.

3301~~~
The way I see it, even when he's poor (and I didn't think he was great today) at least he goes around the pitch actually demanding the ball... thus, everyone in the team knows they have at least one person they can definitely pass it too and we don't look quite as stagnant. When he's not there, and Carrick, Herrera and Mata also aren't there, this becomes even more apparent... people barely even want the ball, let alone demand it. Schneiderlin shits himself because he has nobody to defer too and everything goes down the pan.

3302~~~
He does look unfit, but there's a sense of control of possession when he's in the team, similar to when Scholes was in the team (albeit without the quality of passing that Scholes had).  We got worse tonight when Schwinny was taken off.

3303~~~
I agree. Physically he doesn't have it in him to play so frequently, and technically, I don't think his passing abilities have been that high.

3304~~~
About 5 mins into the 2nd half I had seen him 3 times hiding and tell players not to give him the ball, he was fecked, pointless having him on the pitch, looked like he was trying to direct things, but don't give me the ball, Scholes at 35 was far more energetic and effective, he was eventually hauled off.  The Watford game, he came alive after they scored, looked like he pushed himself beyond his boundaries, he drove it, gave the ball away then drove on to get it back, effectively scored the goal, it was defo his biggest influence on a match since he signed, it was like he pushed himself one last time, but he is nothing to be relied upon.

3305~~~
Its remarkable that he just turned 31 a couple months back, you'd think it was 41 the way people go on.

Of course we are going to look worse when he is taken off and replaced by Fellaini, even a shit Schweinsteiger is better than Fellaini, replace him with any half competent midfielder and it would be a different story. Schweinsteiger keeps the ball but he does absolutely nothing with it.

You mean deferring the most touches and passes of any player? What about those 17 long balls, did he defer those too? He also tried to play to feet to Martial and Rooney plenty of times today, especially in the first half. If anyone was deferring in the midfield it sure as hell wasn't Schneiderlin.

3306~~~
He's definitely played too much. We need to sign a proper starting box to box CM this summer, sell Fellaini and let Schweinsteiger rest a lot more than he does. He'll be coming off the Euros too, which only strengthens the case for that.

3307~~~
I think he plays at his best he currently can but his lack of physical form is hindering to find his best form. Not sure if his fitness levels can be improved

3308~~~
His lack of shape robs him of his best qualities. You can see he's lacking confidence and sticking to the basics. Without a winter break I don't think this is something that can be fixed before the summer. Needs to lose a few pounds, too. There's no way he'll be able to retain his captaincy in the German national team in this condition, he'll struggle to make the bench.

I also think that resorting to using a non-footballer like Fellaini is testament to the fact that we still have a long way to go. Should never be near a United side, so limited.

3309~~~
Call me an imbecile but I genuinely think Van Gaal is the thing holding Bastian back. He did not look past it at the weekend when we were chasing a winner. The sideways, super cautious passing is clearly a tactical instruction. Bastian does not play like this for Germany. Yes, he plays a controlled game but he's not always looking for a five yard ball. Its clear that Van Gaal does not like his centre midfielders going forward or taking risks, we've seen that with his hatred of using Herrera in a deeper role. The way Bastian is playing simply reflects the careful methods of our manager. We won't see the best out of Basti until Van Gaal either takes off the handbrake or takes off out of Man Utd.

3310~~~
Hopefully he does that in January and rests him quite a lot in the 2nd half of the season. We need Schweini fit at the Euros <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3311~~~
It's actually funny. Schweinsteiger was heavily criticised in van Gaal's second season for the same reasons. Many fans and pundits constantly talked about how Schweinsteiger is holding Bayern back with his lack of directness and that he shouldn't start for the nationalteam anymore. Somehow that view changed a lot during the two years under Heynckes. Don't get me wrong, van Gaal deserves a lot of credit for turning Schweinsteiger into a brilliant CM and I'm very thankful for it. But Schweinsteiger's influence was a lot bigger under Löw (especially at the World Cup 2010, where he was in my opinion the best CM of the tournament ahead of Xavi) and under Heynckes.

Still, he should do more. I'm not sure if he still struggles physically and it affects his passing, but it really looks a bit off and with his experience he should make the difference in transition to attack more often during games. He looks way too happy to play it easy and safe for large parts of games, it's not good enough if he wants to help this United side to win trophies.

3312~~~
As a Bayern fan you should know what happens when you try to do 'more' in midfield under Van Gaal: you get dropped. Just look at how Van Gaal has <i>handled</i> Ander Herrera. If Basti looks happy to play it safe its because he knows his crazy manager will be happy with that.  

Just ask yourself this: If Jupp Heynckes was manager of Man Utd, and not Van Gaal, would Basti be playing like this? I think we both know the answer.

3313~~~
Last night was the latest when this happened but it has happened this season before. But I guess LVG had no chance but taking him off - he looked very very tired.

3314~~~
One memory of the match I have is from the first half. Basti gets the ball in midfield and immediately looks up for an option. Rooney, almost inexplicably, starts running further away from him with BFS calling out for someone to come closer for a pass. Seems like instructions to midfielders and attackers could not be more different.

3315~~~
Yeah, it's utterly, utterly bizarre.

3316~~~
Looked tired last night but we fell apart (as we always do) when he went off. That's happened damn near every time he's went off mid-game. 

I also do wonder how much influence LVG's strategy is having on how conservative his play is.

3317~~~
BFS, Bastian 'Fatigued' Schweinsteiger.

3318~~~
You mean those 17 long balls - around 60% of which he was succesful with? and all the good ones came in the first half? A first half where Schweinsteiger was next to him?

Schneiderlin does not go around demanding the ball in the same way or with the same authority that either Carrick or Schweinsteiger do. However, when they're next to him, he's generally more then happy to take the ball as he knows there's that bloke next to him who will, more often then not, want the ball off him... and then, like last night, when Bastian isn't having a great game and/or not taking up positions to recieve the ball due to being knackered, it forces Schneiderlin to actually use his passing range when he has the ball and (eventually) try and knock it long/play an adventurous pass - which he is more then capable of doing.

Then you have the second half, in which Schneiderlin didn't have Schweinsteiger next to him, and his performance rapidly detriorated. It was alsmost as if, because he knew that he didn't have a Schweinsteiger or a Carrick along side him, he didn't have the confidence to take the ball and make things happen himself. Look at how much more time Smalling and Blind were spending on the ball in the second half due to having no outlet in midfield - and the increase in long balls that the both of them had to play.

3319~~~
Yeah, blame van Gaal. In his post match he said the midfielders was not supporting the forwards enough, it's not like LvG tell them to always play safe. I also remember a few long balls from Schweini which didn't come off, he only have himself to blame for that performance.

3320~~~
Yeah Schneiderlin In particular seems to have a drop off in performance whenever Schweinsteiger isn't there. Then again if I received the ball looked up and saw marouane fellaini as my passing option id lose my mind too.

3321~~~
Heynckes would play a bit different in general, but I don't think it's a good excuse for Schweinsteiger being a bit underwhelming so far.

3322~~~
That would be the adjustment I would make as well, Bastian still has plenty to offer but needs to be used more sparingly and at times we'd benefit from having him in a 3 man midfield rather than double pivot.

3323~~~
We have one called Herrera.

3324~~~
We do. But we need another. Let's say it's Verratti for example - even though it won't be - to make me feel better after last night. We can then play:

Verratti--Herrera   (Schweinsteiger)
----Schneiderlin---   (Carrick/Blind)

when we go 4-3-3, or

Verratti-Schneiderlin as a pairing with good rotation or bench options in Herrera, Schweinsteiger and Carrick/Blind. 

And since Mata is he only player on the team who looks capable of being productive as a 10 apart from Herrera and Mata isn't strong enough or well suited to starting every single game, Herrera will get a healthy number of starts in that formation too.

Herrera can still get the 40 or so starts he should if we're in the CL and playing 55 games or so like we'll expect too. 

TLDR: All of Rooney and Fellaini's minutes next year and probably 25% of Schweinsteiger's should go to a CM signing and Herrera.

3325~~~
To be totally honest when Schweinsteiger does try and be more expressive on the ball he gets caught on it. As much as I like the guy and think he's our best midfielder, I still think we've inherited a midfielder well past his peak and far into twilight. He can barely run, his biggest asset is the calmness he brings, he has bags of experience.

3326~~~
I've been underwhelmed by Schweinsteiger so far, he's not influencing the game enough rather trying to be a leader with vocal part of his game rather than influencing play with his football. He's obviously a quality player but he seems to have lost a bit of spark from his Bayern days. 

He's getting caught on the ball too often, and his passing has been inconsistent. Maybe he's just knackered and needs a rest because he can be very important for us in the run in if he can get anywhere near his old level where he used to take games by the scruff of the neck and drive his team forward.

Even thinking back to the OT night in CL under Moyes. He was everywhere that night, making box to box runs, being more expressive and even getting a goal, I haven't seen him make any runs from deep, he's always playing in front of our back four or on the left of midfield when he gets the ball which doesn't suit him.

3327~~~
He's just looked tired recently, was doing much better earlier when he was being rotated with Carrick. Too many injuries forcing the schneids to play every game now.

3328~~~
In his first few games I remember him playing a few delightful balls through the middle to set attackers through on goal. Those have now ceased to exist. The question has to be asked, is this due to LvG tactics? 

He still does the basics very well with good workrate and intelligent play but like others I have expected more over the last few weeks. He is a quality player though so I still have high hopes that he will get to the level we know he is capable of.

3329~~~
The real captain out there.

Wayne just moans his arse off.

3330~~~
Might talk the talk but his football has been poor for a while now, shouldn't be starting.

3331~~~
He looked absolutely knackered to be fair. Needs a rest to recharge his batteries.

3332~~~
To be fair he's on his own out there. Carrick might as well not be playing.

3333~~~
Yes!!

3334~~~
The man. The main man.

3335~~~
Love him. So pleased he got his first proper goal for us now.

3336~~~
Just such a leader out there for us

3337~~~
Try and take that one away from him, feckers.

3338~~~
He's been class.

3339~~~
He deserved that. He looks absolutely shattered, but he's giving you everything he has. Both physically and verbally. Cant say that about everyone.

3340~~~
Yes he fecking is.

3341~~~
At least he his giving his best and kooks actually bothered. More than most of our others out there are doing

3342~~~
Delighted for him, but he doesn't look 100% at all

3343~~~
He's showing guts and class and bursting his lungs to do it all. Like any great United player, he's giving everything he has and more.

3344~~~
Real leader and hope that goal do lot of wonder.

3345~~~
love how pissed off he was after the goal went in.

3346~~~
Im tired of reading 'he looks knackered'. Thats just how he looks, there are players that just have this look to them all the time.

3347~~~
He doesn't just look knackered, he plays like it too.

3348~~~
Captain.

3349~~~
He hasn't been anywhere near class.

3350~~~
I didn't think he looked tired in his play. He wasn't too tired to fight the Leicester player there at the end of the half.

3351~~~
I hope so because we're going to need him to be a beast. They keep running at us.

3352~~~
He's a proper United player, just looks like his body doesn't quite match his intent any more, plenty more to come from him I feel if we switch to a 4-3-3.

3353~~~
He did brilliantly for the goal but it's yet another game passing him by where he's done nothing but play the safest, easiest pass.

3354~~~
He's the real leader on the pitch.

3355~~~
He's been almost just as bad as Carrick.

Constantly shying away from the ball, hiding behind opponents. Showing very little initiative to find space in midfield to receive the ball. 

Not surprised that he is getting praised in here, goes to show how shite the rest of the players have been, but Schweinsteiger is meant to be the main instigator.

3356~~~
And the alternatives are? Playing riskier passes does not guarantee we will improve our attacking play as the passes depend on movement and the defensive setup of the opposition. Leicester are playing deep and on the counter, riskier passes play into their hands, we need craft not risk right now.

3357~~~
Love this guy.

3358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3359~~~
Playing the ball backwards isn't going to help our craft.

3360~~~
For me he has been our best by a considerable mile

3361~~~
Been good since we conceded.

3362~~~
Looked good today, so glad he got his first goal for us.

3363~~~
Really impressive today. Shame he didn't score the header early in the 2nd half. Thought he was our best player.

3364~~~
Feel sorry for him. From Robben/Ribery to Young.

3365~~~
Only player with an sense of urgency late in matches.

3366~~~
Absolute boss. Ran the midfield on his own today. YOu really saw he wanted that win today.

3367~~~
In the post match he said that he is absolutely unhappy to not get the three points. Can we make him captain please?

3368~~~
1 man midfield today, his mentality is 5 levels above anyone else in the squad.

3369~~~
Still looks sloppy at times but he is one of the few players that plays with any drive and intensity.

3370~~~
Prime culprit for slowing our play down. Carrick's passing is miles better

3371~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3372~~~
whot

3373~~~
Class today. If only we had wingers who knew how to put a cross in or go past their men consistently, our play to get the ball to them would actually be useful instead of them  just giving the ball back to Schweinsteiger/Carrick/Mata.

3374~~~
Pity Carrick can't run. But aye, great passing, much wow. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3375~~~
I didn't think he was very good. Maybe our best player midfielder/attacking player but not that impressive.

3376~~~
MOTM for me.

3377~~~
He was so determined to pass backwards today I sometimes forgot which way we were kicking. It's such a shame, the close ability's still there but he's just so negative.

3378~~~
Has a lot of passion for the club. At least make him Vice Captain LVG. We need some energy and passion from our leader. We are crying out for this. Rooney is not suitable; Carrick is too passive; and Smalling does his job very very well, but just doesn't have that extra oomph that's needed. 
Our captains and vice captains don't all have to be British as LVG mistakenly thinks.

3379~~~
He's past it. Great mentality/leadership but on the talent standpoint doesn't do enough. Too safe with his passing, not mobile enough.

3380~~~
I'd argue it's the other way around and Carrick is the prime culprit for slowing our play down.

At least Basti drives forward at times.

3381~~~
Played with the kind of mentality I expect from players in a United shirt.

3382~~~
Thought he played well tonight. 

Did fantastic for the goal too.

3383~~~
Great at controlling games, but his absolute refusal to play any forward or risky passes is getting on my tits.

No wonder he's LVG's wet dream of a midfielder.

3384~~~
Basti is fantastic. He is still a magnificent player. If he can maintain his fitness, he will be great for another 2-3 years to come. He was by far the man of the match today.

3385~~~
Agreed. Plus he's got the right mentality and passion. Wish most of our players did<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3386~~~
Yep, agree completely. Was scrapping in the box and won a fair few headers through determination. Was my MOTM.

3387~~~
Seemed to get in the box more, which was good to see. Not many United players had a poor game and BFS was decent. As a unit, though, christ.

3388~~~
He can do those passes. But LVG doesn't like them.

3389~~~
Gave him man of the match just over Smalling. Always looks like he has the right intent in everything he does, just the lack of movement and pace out wide restricts his options.

3390~~~
I keep hearing that his legs are gone and he's too slow. He runs around the pitch like a man possessed, and he looks much faster than say Schneiderlin does. Is it just a cliche, used to make it sound like people know the insights of a man's physique? 

Thought he was really good today; I don't think his vision is as good as say Scholes', or even Carrick's as he often overlooks the simple pass to a player in space and dwells on the ball, but he is so resolute and such a presence on the pitch that he is now invaluable to our team.

3391~~~
Yeah, his two passes straight to Leicester players in our own half were masterful, i must admit. If only Schweinstieger could do that.

3392~~~
The real captain

3393~~~
Carrick has quite better passing, he's a bit older though and just came from injury.

3394~~~
This! The way he was trying to organise the rest of the team on our corners was fantastic and trying to lift everyone after he scored his goal. He might not be as good as he used to be but he certainly makes up for that in his experience and in his willingness to do well for the club.

3395~~~
Judging by his post match comments yesterday, Bastian was pissed off. Good.

3396~~~
Bossed the game. And his leadership qualities and desire are a great addition as well. Plus the guy really puts a lot into every game. Was pressing their midfielder in the first few minutes in their half ahead of strikers which is fantastic to see.

3397~~~
People that talk in buzzwords like that are just talking bollocks. If someone isn't articulating their problem they're probably wenting so just skip over the comment.

3398~~~

3399~~~
Deserved. Saved our asses in the PL a couple of times even if looked off the boil a bit too.

3400~~~
I think it should've been Smalling again but Basti has been one of the better of our rotten bunch.

3401~~~
Not really sure how he's won that tbh. He's not been great.

3402~~~
Well... it  has to be <i>someone</i>. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3403~~~
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'd have gone with Smalling or De Gea probably, they've been flawless all season really.

3404~~~
One of our better performers this last month, but I imagine his popularity with the fans also gave him a vote or two. Nothing wrong with that!

3405~~~
This past month has included his worst performances for the club, a couple where he was completely awful. He only won it because of his name and he scored a goal despite being crap for the rest of the match. There were easily more deserving players.

3406~~~
Not sure why he came off, he was trying to force the play, trying to press up and help the forwards. I guess maybe LvG feels he doesn't have the legs to sustain that for 90 minutes, especially with the Wolfsburg game so close.

3407~~~
His passing was shocking

3408~~~
Should've scored his chance. Or at least got it on target.

3409~~~
We need another top class CM in the summer. He's still a class act, but he looks knackered halfway through games a lot of the time, we should be looking to get as much value out of him as possible and thats not running him into the ground playing 2+ games a week.

3410~~~
When we were swapping him and Carrick early in the season I thought it was working. problem is injuries are not helping us in terms of that.

We tend to lose control of the game when he comes off, so thankfully that didnt happen today.

3411~~~
hive said it in another thread its times when he feels like hes in his late thirties coming out of retirement, hes good for us but his fittness and mobility is a real concern if we want to make a progress..

3412~~~
Looked tired as the game wore on. All our cover is injured so it sucks but he has to play every game pretty much as we fall apart without him usually.

3413~~~
He's always drenched with sweat after like 60 minutes. Like his whole shirt is just soaked.

3414~~~
The commentators were making too much from the push, there was nothing in it just tussling by both players. Clatternburg got it right.

3415~~~
Thought he was playing well, few stray passes here and there but nothing terribly bad. 

We do need another younger CM though that can dictate play, if he doesn't believe in Herrera doing that job of course.

3416~~~
I thought he was pretty average to be honest. His passing in particular was a bit off.

3417~~~
Today was his first match I saw live. To his credit he is excellent when we don't have possession, in positioning, pressing, tackling, nicking the ball, and breaking up play.  Once we have the ball however, he's a disaster. Nearly always negative, even if he sees someone breaking in front he simply won't pass to him, choosing to turn to look for someone level or behind to pass to instead. It's no wonder there's not much movement in front of him, there's not a lot of point in making a run.  On the ball he's taken the 'give it and go' mantra to a new level, now to be known as 'give it and stop'. Quite a few in this thread say he's an attacking midfielder, so I have to ask, does he ever take anyone on? does he ever run into space in front of the ball to receive a forward pass? is he a goal threat? No, times three. I can't see any role for Schwein except as a holding midfielder, and I admit I don't know if he can actually do that, but if he can't, then he's not first eleven for me.

3418~~~
Apart from some of his passes in the final third I thought he was good, although still think he's wasted playing him so deep.

3419~~~
The reason we see him being substituted almost every match is he struggles to play two full matches a week.

3420~~~
Should have used Pereira more instead of burning him out.

3421~~~
I said this last week. He's one of the main reasons our play is so slow. He takes too long on the ball and rarely takes a risk.

3422~~~
we play with 2 holding midfielders. Barely taking a risk is the theme throughout the team. Maybe, just maybe he is playing exactly how the manager wants him to

3423~~~
Apparently he might face a 3 match ban for the elbow on Winston Reid.

3424~~~
Yes, I can see that. Don't see how it changes the problem though.

3425~~~
we are flying when he isnt playing....

3426~~~
If he's banned and Morgan still out by our next league game, we're onto some midfield crisis.Could be a chance to force LVG to use Pereira though.

3427~~~
Ref saw it and has probably put it in his report. Won't face anything further in my opinion.

3428~~~
It's the FA. I wouldn't put anything past them.

3429~~~
We have Fellaini also.

3430~~~
They're calling it violent conduct. There was absolutely nothing to it. The West Ham player's dived holding his face when the contact was with his upper chest and with the forearm, not with the elbow. Of course the FA charge him; it's the FA.

3431~~~
Aye, ref clearly dealt with the "situation", I thought the FA couldn't intervene then?

3432~~~
Shocked the FA have charged him , but I did think at the time he was lucky not to get some sort of card.

3433~~~
Players are dropping like flies.Wouldn't be surprised if someone get injured during warm-up tomorrow.

3434~~~
Thought he should have gotten a card. It was a bit reckless to swing your elbow like that. Don't think there was enough in it to get a ban though.

3435~~~
There was no intent or maliciousness to it, Reid was pulling his shirt all the time and Schweinsteiger just pushed him away to get free. You see incidents like this every game

3436~~~
He's been pitiful so far.

3437~~~
Blind is offering a lot more pass-wise in defence than Schweinsteiger is. Mata and Martial look on point today, so he should be trying to regularly feed them with dangerous passes.

3438~~~
What has happened to his passing? It's completely deserted him of late.

3439~~~
He has been absolutely Shit today. Just let wolfsburg through to our defence. Barely makes a forward pass. Pathetic so far.

3440~~~
That giveaway was just horrendous. Put us under so much pressure again.

3441~~~
But... BFS!!

3442~~~
I would sub him, he's been awful.

3443~~~
He's been playing like Brian McClair in his last season tonight. He's blood is getting twisted by this lot.

3444~~~
He has been fecking garbage for 4 games now. I'd still probably leave him in but get Carrick in to partner him at least.

3445~~~
Looks like an old man tonight. Some very strange positions he's taking up when he's meant to be holding.

3446~~~
Has been awful.

3447~~~
Flat footed on their second and careless on more than one occasion, we really needed him to step up tonight with so many kids on.

3448~~~
worst midfield two in our recent history, absolutely no control and mobility, pereira/carrick on for fellaini who should never be a manutd palyer in the first place

3449~~~
His lack of positional discipline is shocking for me. Never would have expected that to be his failing.

3450~~~
Been utter crap today.

3451~~~
poor

3452~~~
He's a bit of a trudger, in all honesty.
This squad seems to be collecting them. Such a lack of players with quick feet and agility in this squad.

If the game is fast-paced, he gets twisted and turned for fun. And if the opposition sits back and allows us to pass, he hasn't the zip in play/passing to really get the team going.

This midfield still needs work. Herrera, Schneiderlin plus one (Gundogan?) please. Even <i>that </i>three may not be good enough, actually.

3453~~~
Absolute nightmare performance so far. Didn't stop Draxler before the 2-1 and lost the ball which almost led to a 3-1 if de Gea wouldn't have saved us. 

Really disappointing this is the response after the criticism from LvG.

3454~~~
He's been left to do too much in midfield by himself tonight, not surprised he's playing so poor. Playing him and Fellaini in the center was a crazy decision. We badly need to make a change, but our options on the bench are dire.

3455~~~
Awful game from him and our midfield was a gaping hole.<span style="font-size: 16px"> With Carrick there instead we would have probably won this.</span>

3456~~~
Are we ready to admit he hasn't been very good?

3457~~~
He's positionally suspect, gets beaten way too easily, wastes too much time on the ball and never passes forwards, even when we make a rare run.

3458~~~
Schweinsteiger was poor, but I don't see what else Carrick would've offered. He's hardly been any better this season.

3459~~~
Played alone in midfield. Can't blame him.

3460~~~
Somewhat glad he's not playing the next 3 games. Needs a break and time to get his shit together.

3461~~~
Fellaini did him no favours, but it's perfectly reasonable to criticise Schweinsteiger considering he offered little in the way of forward passes when he was on the ball. There's still some imperative on him to create for us, even if he's got someone who's very poor beside him.

3462~~~
Played without confidence tonight. Thanks Van Gaal for needlessly singling him out.

3463~~~
Bit early I know, but looks like another one of all the poor signings LvG has done since he joined us. He's not even close to being the worst though and has just been here 6 months so things can change.

3464~~~
I don't know what he does apart from drop back on goalkicks to pick it up from De Gea. They were cutting through our midfield repeatedly with Fellaini upfield and Schweinsteiger nowhere to be see. Don't think it would have happened with Carrick there.

3465~~~
Legs completely gone, we need cover so he can play now and again as a squad player.

3466~~~
Why not? Carrick's been just as anonymous in midfield as Schweinsteiger has sometimes been this season. I was fine for Carrick to be brought on, but I don't think he offered us anything that Schweinsteiger didn't.

3467~~~
Best midfielder in the league, bun that talk. He's been average at best and quite a pointless buy with Carrick here already.

3468~~~
Carrick is a proper holding midfielder, even when not fully on top of his game he is still important defensively with his positioning. Like I said I just don't know what Schweinsteiger does really.

3469~~~
Those 3 games he's about to get off will give him the rest he looks like he really needs, it was hilarious listening to his buddy Hargreaves baffled by him being subbed off.

3470~~~
Throw money at Gundogan and basically forget about Carrick and Schweinsteiger. They shouldn't be starting the majority of games any more.

3471~~~
His performance certainly merited being substituted. What on earth were Schweinsteiger and Fellaini doing in that first half ?

3472~~~
Has confirmed the concerns i had at the time of signing, he's past it.

3473~~~
He cannot play as much as he is put to play ATM.. He made some woeful errors tonight(Wolfsburg A) which I don't think he would had made if he was physically fit.. Carrick was needed to shape up the midfield much earlier than we did.

3474~~~
Really bad tonight. He doesn't look fit and to be honest he's way past his best.

3475~~~
He seriously just needs a few weeks rest. Unfortunately with our injuries, that's not happening.

3476~~~
Meh, never expected him to shine. Bayern saw it coming.

3477~~~
At least in terms of starting consistently. He's become a situational player.

3478~~~
I'm getting sick of this needs a rest shit, the guy just turned 31. He needs to get his shit together if he can't play 90 minutes at 31. He isn't an OAP. Its fecking embarrassing. At 31 Carrick was leading us to a PL title and was the best midfielder in the league. Schweinsteiger isn't a fraction of that.

3479~~~
Bayern never sell a player who is in their prime, only when their past their best or surplus to requirements, unlike us

3480~~~
Expected him to be more of a leader on the pitch tbh. Hasnt lived up to his reputation enough in that sense so far. Struggled to lift the peformances of the team like I thought he might.

3481~~~
I was hoping for him to put in a big performance for us tonight but instead he was the worst player out there for us.

3482~~~
Was shite. Absolute shambles of a performance IMO. Needs to be much, much better than that as the 'leader' he is supposed to be. Not having the 'Fellaini did him no favours' stuff either. Sure it may have helped a little if Fellaini wasn't wandering on the left wing but to use that as an excuse for Bastian's whole performance is wrong. Poor.

3483~~~
Started his career at United well, then went downhill.

I could be describing anyone we've signed under LvG here bar Martial.

3484~~~
Was terrible tonight. He's only 31, we should be seeing so much more from him.

3485~~~
Imagine how the other players must feel at his incessant, arm-waving, ordering about, shit, when he himself is contributing so little.

I would like to see one of the younger lads, who played their hearts out tonight, tell him in no uncertain terms to concentrate on his own fecking game.

3486~~~
He can't play more than once a week anymore.

3487~~~
He had his Gerrard moment tonight, his legs have gone.

3488~~~
And after all the shit I got in the summer people are now realising that we're not actually signing the best midfielder in the world <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

He's just getting worse as the season goes on. His legs are gone.

3489~~~
Bayern does it again.Sold us sicknote Hargreaves and now a burned out Schweinsteiger.Beckenbauer said he would struggle in the PL .But we went ahead anyway.

3490~~~
It was painful to watch him yesterday <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3491~~~
Bastian feckING Schweinsteiger!

3492~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3493~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> indeed. All those idiots who said we were getting the best CM in the world.

3494~~~
He was really poor last night but has been pretty solid up to that point if you ask me.

Kneejerkers all over the shop in here. What is this a feckin convention?

3495~~~
Been poor recently. As others have said his legs look so heavy. The same can be said for Carrick but at least he has the quality on the ball to pick out forward passes. We've yet to see Schweinsteiger do that and at the moment he is a bit of a passenger.

3496~~~
Agreed, the only problem I have is it's games like last night where I thought his experience would be invaluable. At just under seven million pounds it's still been a great value signing for me.

3497~~~
He's shot - needs a break asap!

3498~~~
He was very poor but people seem to be ignoring the fact that he was playing alone against 3 midfielders.

3499~~~
I don't think he was a bad signing but he's clearly not good enough to be a mainstay in a team looking to win stuff. When fit Carrick should be starting every game.

3500~~~
I'm seeing this a lot, but I'm not particularly sure why - Carrick's been average himself this season, and hasn't offered us anything more than Schweinsteiger has. He looks just as shot physically.

3501~~~
I don't even think Carrick has been average, I think he's absolutely dreadful. 
He looks completely finished at this level, although I would definitely use him and Schweinsteiger separately to save both their legs.

3502~~~
Please show me a single post, by anyone, which suggested that? There are a few idiots on here but I'm fairly sure that nobody thought a 31 year old midfielder who cost less than £10m was the best in the world.

3503~~~
Maybe not, but we've still got scores of posters carrying on with this BFS shite.

3504~~~
Because he can actually pass the ball forward. He's been better than Schweinsteiger and anyone able to look past the fancy name will see that.

3505~~~
He's been poor all season for me bar a few games. He's nowhere near his Bayern best or even 80% of that, his passing isn't creative at all and when he does try a difficult ball he puts too much trajectory on it literally landing it on the player's chest with someone closing him down.

In fairness, earlier in the season some of his through balls were top class and carving teams apart but that hasn't happened for a good few months now. LvG hasn't managed him well in all honesty, and that's definitely not a strong point of his management in terms of the use of his squad. A 31 year old who has struggled for injuries playing in the most demanding position yet being asked to play two high profile games in a week is madness. 

Only reason he has been rated on here is because of his name and leadership skills but as has been mentioned by me and many others, what's the point of all this leadership and finger pointing when your own game is amongst the worst. Lead by example and all that.

He's never far forward enough compared to his Bayern days. He used to get the ball in the final third and play quick incisive passes or if he was closed down, he actually had quick feet to beat a man and create something but now he's just sitting deep, getting on the ball and slowing down our play. Needs a rest, especially over the xmas period seeing as he's used to a winter break.

3506~~~
I just think he needs to be rotated. Switch him and Carrick every game, neither can play back to back games really as their performance greatly suffers. They'll both improve a lot I think.

3507~~~
We're about to hit the busiest part of the season in terms of matches. This ban will do him some good at least.

3508~~~
This is actually a very good point. How can a 31 year old, have lost his legs?

3509~~~
Because he's an individual, not a statistic?

3510~~~
I'm sure he'll find them in the last place he looks.

3511~~~
I think he can adapt his game to our benefit. It's also his first season in an unstable team. Our expectations are maybe a tad unrealistic. He is performing just fine in my book and will get better.

3512~~~
I'd like us to be more cautious about signing big name players who are unhappy at their current club next time, especially 30+ years old ones.He's an asset to the squad but I don't see us going anywhere if we make him one of our key players.Would be surprised if he's still here after summer of 2017.

3513~~~
Typical Knee jerk forum terrets. I read some absolute crap on here always after a loss. I don't see him struggling in the German World Cup winning side? Look around the team and ask how many would make any of the top 3 teams in Spainish, German or even bloody English football including Leicester at the moment. The issues aren't about him, he has pedigree but sorry the 80% of the rest of the team doesn't.

3514~~~
So would I. Indeed I was perfectly happy with David Gill's rule of not paying big money for players past their mid 20s. I suppose in this case the transfer fee was low but his wages will inevitably be high. 

Schweinsteiger has impressed me in a few games this season. Watford away is one, Leicester away another. But in the big games you'd hope he'd turn up for, he's been shocking.

3515~~~
Watford!? You were impressed with him against Watford? He was fecking awful, just because he forced the own goal doesn't change the fact he was bloody dreadful for the 90 minutes before that. Watford was one of his worst performances, 72% passing and consistently fecking up simple passes to the fullbacks by playing ridiculous suicide lobbed balls in which he could play on the ground.

He was better at Leicester but still far from impressive. His best performances were early on in the season, despite his goal and the own goal, he has been shite lately.

3516~~~
Say 'Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger' out loud and you'll quickly realise why, it's easily the coolest name in the squad.

3517~~~
Given our difficulties in scoring goals and indeed, creating chances, I place a great deal of importance on those factors. Retaining possession doesn't impress me, especially if the game is level or we are behind.

In the early part of the season he tended to come on as a sub and control possession, which was fine if we happened to be in the lead but of limited use if we needed a goal. He started against Newcastle yet we looked far better when Carrick came on and we started getting some chances. Swansea away was another non-event. Up until Watford, not only had he neither scored nor got an assist, he'd barely looked like creating anything; perhaps that's not his role. May be he is best suited to sitting on the bench then coming on if we happen to be ahead.

Quite frankly I'd have Herrera starting in central midfield (as opposed to no 10) whenever he is fit, as he offers us creativity and a goal threat. I'd be prepared to pay the price in terms of defensive vulnerability, though Schweinsteiger's defensive efforts against Wolfsburg were far from impressive.

3518~~~
Schweinsteiger was a fantastic signing, not only because of his ability on the field, but also his force of personality off it.

The major problem is that he's being run into the ground. Van Gaal needs to pick and choose his games and we'll then see a much more effective player.

Not surprised to see many fans have turned against the player. It's like a fecking free for all at the moment.

3519~~~
Agreed, when we signed hi  I thought it was to rotate him and Carrick but he's been played too much.

3520~~~
I'm probably wrong, but last time I checked his Twitter profile there was SOMETHING suggesting he plays for United... right now he's not got anything in his bio and his pic/header is him in a German kit

3521~~~
His picture was him during our Adidas kit launch. 

Not 100% sure of his bio but I'm pretty sure it had reference to playing for United. 

I wouldn't read too much into it.

3522~~~
tbf Bastian has been subbed off in most matches. He cannot play more than one match a week. Still he was overall a very good signing. But I do wonder how effective he will be next season or two.

3523~~~
He will go when Pep comes. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3524~~~
I love Basti, but I don't think he is being managed at all well by LvG. 

It's surprising as LvG is the guy that Schweinsteigered Schweini.

3525~~~
Could the Caf possibly think for one second, just one... that maybe Basti has been underperforming? 

I have many friends who watch Bayern Munich religiously and even they say that his pass accuracy has dropped remarkably at United and he's not been able dictate like he did for Germany at the WC.

3526~~~
I like his play, he is not the issue for the poor games.

3527~~~
Schweinsteiger is doing his part. Not been great this season but you can tell he's a big player the way he solves some situations. He offers a lot to us regarding leadership, aggressiveness, will to win and calmness. If you took him off the team we would definitely be worse off. 

To me he's a big clubs version of a water carrier. These players are not the best footballers but are the best footballers for that role they play. Deschamps, Edgar Davids are typical examples as well as Roy Keane. Every club need these sort of bricks who can handle all situations and not just the attack.

3528~~~
Yeah, while I'm not laying the blame entirely at LVG's feet I'd argue some of BFS's worst performances were down to questionable management decisions, namely the Arsenal game where he was pushed up the pitch and made to press in weird, ineffective positions. That's not to say I know better than a guy who has managed Bastian for years, it was just baffling to see that mess play out the way it did during such an important away game, in the midst a decent run of results.

3529~~~
He's  been a little bit of a disappointment so far, don't get me wrong he has probably been our best midfielder and there are certainly bigger issues with our squad but I was expecting more from him than he has showed so far. His passing especially has not been anywhere near the level I was expecting, hopefully it is all because he is setteling in to a new team, league and country and not him having regressed as a player.

3530~~~
Brilliant player but needs guys with mobility beside him to bring out the best in him and hide his deficiencies not Carrick or Fellaini who are pedestrian around the park just as much as Bastian.

3531~~~
Not sure why you're saying that when I'm pretty sure most would agree?

3532~~~
Ah right okay, thought he had something in his bio too. Twitter changes usually derive from some sort of fall out, but that's nothing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3533~~~
Forgot he was even a United player today. Is he injured?

3534~~~
Suspended for 3 matches..

3535~~~
Suspended for 3 games because of his clash with Winston Reid. Today was the second match.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35064336" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35064336</a>

3536~~~
Dear God, I should have remembered that.

3537~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/628332/Bastian-Schweinsteiger-criticism-poor-Manchester-United-performances-news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/foot...cism-poor-Manchester-United-performances-news</a>

3538~~~
So this is the best we can hope for then?

Shit.

3539~~~
Where are the 'Basti will be fine with LVG's public criticism' people at now then?

3540~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

van Gaal lost the dressing room a long time ago to be honest, they make fun of him now. First Powell, now Schweini <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3541~~~
What's Powell done?

3542~~~
He liked a tweet criticizing Van Gaal for spending too much money. But then tweeted that it happened accidentally.

3543~~~
He's a 31 year old, who clearly past his physical peak. 

Playing him in a midfield two, in the PL, in every game, is just asking for trouble.

He should be used in a midfield 3, with two other players (Morgan&Herrera) who can provide the 'legs' of the midfield. Similar to what Juve did with Pirlo. Same goes for Carrick.

3544~~~
I mean, every footballer thinks they're brilliant but it surely can't have escaped his attention that he can barely, you know, run nowadays?

3545~~~
My point was that he thinks he isn't past his peak.  But as for tactics, there is no way that a club of our resources, and having spent so much, should be having to play any formation out of fear to suit an ageing player that we've only just gone out and bought.   It's not Schwein's fault, it's LVGs for bringing him here, whatever he cost. Your suggestion reminds me of when we got Blanc, and the entire defence had to stay back because of him. A feck-up.

3546~~~
You put any player in world football in this United side and they will look half the player they are.

That's the thing.

I was actually <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/bastian-schweinsteiger-signed-for-mufc-confirmed.404903/page-71#post-17761119">skeptical</a> when we bought Schweinsteiger, precisely because I worried about his fitness.

But when the likes of Rooney, Mata, Schweinsteiger and Depay are *all* looking average to utterly gash on a regular basis, then you have to wonder whether there's more to it than just their own individual limitations.

3548~~~
If you read carefully he's actually saying the criticism he's received from the media - nothing about LVG. He may be pissed with LVG, but he says nothing about that here.

3549~~~
Has Basti done something bad to spark this stuff about how he can no longer run?! I thought he'd been fine in the games he's played. A couple of ropey ones, but lots of decent performances too.

3550~~~
If he thinks he's been okay he must have similar standards to LvG, he's been average imo.

3551~~~
Do you actually watch United? He may look shattered when he plays (as does Smalling) but to say he can't run is ridiculous. 

His work rate has been fantastic; better then Mata, Depay, Rooney, Jones etc.

3552~~~
Work rate or no work rate, there is no point anyone making runs in front of him because they won't get the ball. Must be soul-destroying for attacking players.

3553~~~
He has been average. We were desperate for a player to rotate with Carrick who was vital last season.
Both of them don't have the legs for a 2 man midfield anymore, they need to play behind two hard working midfielders where they can get the Space to dictate play without worrying about being pressed as much and covering alot of Space defensively.

Luckily he "only" cost us 8m quid.

3554~~~
I'd say he's deluded even.

3555~~~
I've read this so often I've gone mental. We were absolutely, absolutely not desperate for a player to <b>rotate</b> with Carrick, we were absolutely desperate for a player to <b>replace</b> Carrick. We could have kept Carrick on to cover injury, but at his age we should really have been letting him go. 

Two declining players do not make one first choice man and never will.

3556~~~
One of Carrick/Schweini should be playing with<b> both </b>Schneiderlin and Herrera in a three and we should be playing 4-3-3 but alas we don't.

3557~~~

3558~~~
Not really.

The caf only really has three moods the 'everything goods we're the best team in the world' mood, the 'despite being pretty good, everyone is shit' mood and the 'the sky is falling in burn the whole club down and start again' mood.

We're firmly in the last one at the minute, and between now and the time Van Gaal goes each and everyone of our players will be called shit.

3559~~~
Anyone got a GIF of his Messi impression.

3560~~~
We are a better side with him in it but he still leaves me disappointed watching him.

3561~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he's been poor in this game?

3562~~~
He hasn't been great by any stretch of the imagination.

3563~~~
He's slowed the play down constantly and looks absolutely knackered

3564~~~
This game? People have bought into his name and status so much they've ignored his inability to give nothing more than a 6/10 all season. His passing is cowardly.

3565~~~
It's not just the passing. Anytime he has to go forwards, be it a pass or a dribble, he's struggled. Terrible performance.

3566~~~
Cowardly

3567~~~
Not being a coward. He just doesn't have the ability to pass between lines with any kind of zip, or to dribble past anyone. He's not choosing not to do something he's capable of. He's just not capable of anything special with the ball at his foot. 
He's been 'okay' at best this season.

The midfield is still not close to being where it needs to be.

3568~~~
Very harsh

3569~~~
Not his greatest game granted but better than Carrick of late and Mata

3570~~~
Yeah...he's a bit shit really isn't he?

3571~~~
You'd think with all that time and space he had he'd be able to impose himself in the game more.

3572~~~
Certainly appears that way.

3573~~~
He was blowing out of his arse in the first half. It's shocking how a player of that age can be as unfit as he is.

3574~~~
The attacking part of his game has completely left him. I think the only role he can play now is our defensive pivot in the carrick role.

3575~~~
He's never been one to impose himself in an ultra-positive way or to move the ball into dangerous areas.
His best attributes were/are basically being a leader, being tactically versatile and being disciplined.
His actual ball-work is nothing special.

Delph and Dembele offer more with a ball at their foot.

3576~~~
I thought he was ok.

3577~~~
We're better when he plays.

3578~~~
He does help give our midfield more control, but we do need him to impose himself more.

3579~~~
He was shit.

3580~~~
This to be honest.

It's quite evident. He did miss 3 games tbf to him. He seemed to tire late.

3581~~~
You can say that again!

3582~~~
He was good. How blind do you have to be to not see we're a better team when he plays.

3583~~~
Does well to move in to space to receive the ball, on the ball itself however he is quite poor. Takes too many touches and sloppy with his control too. Every time he takes a heavy touch he invariably ends up losing it as he doesn't have the recovery speed or agility to get out of trouble.

3585~~~
Poor today, too cumbersome, too many touches, too many sideways passes, too slow.

3586~~~
You could copy and paste that most weeks.

3587~~~
Better when he plays, but how many times did he try and fool the opposition into thinking he was going to dribble round them only for them to call his bluff that his legs don't actually work?

3588~~~
This.

3589~~~
He didn't do enough when he had the freedom of the midfield and struggled when more pressure came late on, he just looks heavy and cumbersome when he tries to drive the ball forward, like his legs wont obey him.

3590~~~
Cumbersome is a good word to describe him.

Shane that players with such obvious weaknesses are still far better than any alternatives we have.

Continue with him, Morgan and Herrera in the middle.

3591~~~
We are better when he plays becaause he is a warrior both on and off the ball, he is actually quite underrated defensively, and he helps us control the midfield bit better than our other midfielders, but with the ball he is really average. And I am not talking just about his creativity and passing, his touch is seriously average for a supposed once upon a time world class midfielder. If you were that good surely your first touch can't be that average? It's not bad, but it's average. Scholes at his 37 had much better first touch and could get away from some situations more easily, he doesn't have that, and it's not like that's something you lose, you either have it or not, and by the looks of it his technique was never great. Carrick's first touch with his left foot is quite often better than Scweini's with his right foot.

I have criticised him earlier for his passing, but I can understand that that can be down to our style of play and what van Gaal asks from him, but the touch thing is quite simple, you either have good touch or you don't. I am really starting to think that I used to overrate him before he joined us.

3592~~~
There are some people that will criticise him every week because his name isn't Michael Carrick. It's so obvious we're a better side when he plays but every week people shit on him.

3593~~~
He´s a maestro, but he´s not making the music himself anymore. United needed somebody like him. They got what they paid for. He just needs a decisive play-making partner in defensive midfield and some fullbacks that push forward. If you expect Schweinsteiger to be the playmaker and best technical midfielder you are in deep shit. Obviously when you play for Bayern and Germany, who have top class defensive midfielders in abundance, his weaknesses won´t hurt the flow of the game. Meanwhile his positives will shine through.   

To add: He´s been surprisingly healthy. I didn´t expect that.

3594~~~
we're definitely more solid with him and Schneiderlin in there. certainly couldn't have seen us losing 4 in a row if those two had been in there each game.

doesn't solve the attacking issues though obviously.

3595~~~
in a team of shirkers he is one of the few who will always accept the ball, even if not having a good game. The players actually need him in the side to calm them down, whenever he isn't on the pitch the shape collapses. He has put weight on though even in these last 3 games off, pretty shocked when I saw him waddling around today

3596~~~
He can offer a lot but when he gets tired I think he needs to be managed better. Someone needs to reign him in and tell him to either conserve energy and dictate from deeper or sub him. Wasn't the first time that he gives the ball away cheaply in the final third towards the end of the game when he's shattered. He's trying to do the right thing but just doesn't have the stamina for it.

He's undoubtedly a leader, always wanting the ball, wanting to make something happen and that's great but I think we can use him more effectively.

3597~~~
Schweinsteiger is/was the best allround midfielder there is. Yes, there are players that pass better, dribble better, have a better ball control, are faster, are better headers of the ball, are better shooters etc. - name it and you will find them even in his own teams. You will not find a midfielder who is capable of all of this things to atleast a good level... 

It is this variety of abilities that make him the world class player - not one or two specialities in which he is the best but others he is weak or mediocre. 

I guess some here need the punching ball why this match today was no win. In my eyes what you do not have right now is any streak of luck. Everything is just running against you.

3598~~~
It's blatantly the other way round.

3599~~~
In home games where we dominate the ball, Scholes at 41 would probably offer more to our attacking play.

3600~~~
I think we're massively less shit when he plays, as opposed to better.

3601~~~
Maybe the new manager will build his team around him?

3602~~~
What is there to build around? Does he pass particularly well? Get forward much? 
It would be building around a player who has no outstanding qualities to build around.

3603~~~
It was a joke Speak, he'll be out on his arse in the summer. His admirers will be able to follow him at his next club, if he doesn't retire.

3604~~~
Bastian 'fatarse' Schweinsteiger.

He looked so off the pace today.

3605~~~
Completely useless, spends most of his time on his arse slide tackling because he cannot get to the pitch of the ball, contributes nothing but slowing things down and has nothing to offer when on the ball bar short passes, a number of which miss the target, same again today.

3606~~~
I looked absolutely fooked after about half an hour. Still rate him highly but today wasn't his best day.

3607~~~
It is basically a shambles because nobody in the team except Martial, DDG and Smalling are playing good. You would think that a MF including BFS , Herrera and Morgan would be the best in the league but it isn't good enough

3608~~~
That doesn't mean Schweinsteiger has been great for us since joining. He's been average and given us some stability, but he hasn't be close to world class for us. Granted some of it is due to the entire team not performing well, but he commits basic errors that shouldn't happen to a player of his caliber.

3609~~~
The 'problem' with Bastian's inconsistencies are his instincts to play forward passes, receive in tight(er) spaces and generally wanting to be more progressive/move the ball forward. The reality is that he isn't as nimble as he wants to and we don't have enough options through the MIDDLE.

EVERYONE is comfortable receiving and passing down the channels but most are scared to receive it in the opposition middle for fear of getting dispossessed/countered. What ends up happening is why you see so many square passes because there is literally only about one option in the central areas, it's usually your Herrera or Mata (or Rooney, who will lose it/momentum of the move, pass it back anyways) and they usually have to come out of position, receive from deep where they can't do jack with it.

3610~~~
True. I call this 'England national team syndrome'

When players don't want to ever pass to anyone who's unmarked, or to receive the ball unless they're unmarked.
So they spend the whole game running AROUND that zone that does the most damage, and  they spend the whole game passing in front of the opposition. And even with 60% + possession, the only real avenue is still going round the opposition and crossing, because playing through the middle is impossible without being comfortable in those tight areas.

Better players are needed. Players who don't mind playing in those areas.
Pjanic, for example, would make a huge difference to this side immediately.

Herrera attempts it, but is scrappy with his technique. Same for Rooney, who also often needs three touches to get the ball under control, where better players only need one.
I disagree about Mata, though. He's just as useless under pressure as the others. He avoids the centre just as much as anyone, and he gives the ball up pretty much as soon as he's closed down.

3611~~~
He's looking like a spent force at the moment to be honest. We all know this isn't the Schweinsteiger that built up a world class reputation. He might have to accept his own limitations and adapt his game like Scholes did in order to get back on track.

3612~~~
He is an interesting one. We are better with him in the team but he still doesn't really do much. I've been disappointed with him. Just a bit meh really.

3613~~~
Was expecting more after his winter break, although I've been expecting more from him since day 1 and so I shouldn't be too surprised that I'm left wondering what he brings to the team.

3614~~~
He is so slow when making a passing decision. So annoying that he takes a few moments to pass the ball whereas it could be done much quicker. This lack of quick thinking closes the space in front of him and therefore he passes it back too often.

3615~~~
I'd still start him ahead of Carrick, who nowadays disappears when games get tough. I'm amazed Bastian lasted the full 90 though.

3616~~~
Even with Scholes (prime Scholes) we'll be going nowhere with this team. We're pushing too far ahead their box is congested for anyone to make a pass. 

Under Fergie we defend deeper hence there's alot of room to attack the space (boss?), with this possession football we barely have enough room to stand let along making runs, but our own half is empty most of the time

3617~~~
I worry about how he is going to fair the more the season develops as he is really looking tired at the moment. I put it down to the 3 games per week thing when we were still in the CL but the past week or so it hasn't even been that. I'd probably keep him away from the Europa League games once they start and play him on the Sundays, That way he should be more fresh.

3618~~~
We are better when he plays and more stable (except against Arsenal, was horrendous), but I dont know how. I think he's average sorry to say.

But maybe just like Carrick did, he is still positionally very good and blocks of certain areas where dangers could come from. Dont know how we're better attackingly as well, he has as much attacking intent as Cleverley did for us.

3619~~~
He's a strange player these days.... although he never looks great himself we always seem to play better when he's on the pitch... I've no idea why, perhaps his mobility (even though he's a bit slow, he moves around more compared to players like Fellaini, Carrick at least) or maybe just his leadership/gravitas/will to win.

3620~~~
Have to agree, there is a better shape to us with him...but he himself doesn't contribute a lot to our play. He doesn't really dictate anything going forward.

I find his passing cowardly.

3621~~~
He hasn't set our game alight, but there were a number of instances yesterday where he was available for a simple pass down the middle, asking for the ball, and was overlooked for a pass out to the sides by the defenders. That's not his fault.

3622~~~
Let's be honest the warning signs of his downfall were the fact that Bayern let him leave so easily and for so cheap

We signed a spent force even though he is still a decent player

Sadly I would be looking to replace him already next summer

I was not a huge fan of this signing in the summer and got slated for it. It is very reminiscent of the time Chelsea signed Ruud Gullit. You can still see his class from time to time but gets found out more often than not

3623~~~
Definitely agree with the first part. I was absolutely delighted when we signed him, but I was also slightly curious as to why Bayern were allowing a club legend who had often been a key player leave for such a minimal fee, when he was still only hitting his 30's. I get the argument that the club were allowing him to do his own thing because of all his service, but it was surely a tad telling for most people that they seemed perfectly happy to let him go.

3624~~~
He's not being utilised correctly, and that's down to LvG. His best performances came when he's in the middle dictating play for Bayern or Germany. Not collecting the ball off Darmian by the touchline, or on the right touchline. He deviates from the middle too much.

3625~~~
Doesn't it say everything about the current status of Bayern and United..

Their star midfielder and club legend wins the world cup and a year later they're prepared to ship him our for peanuts for the good of the club and we have a supposed club legend who flops at the World cup, is clearly past his best.. SAF doesn't rate him and = whom we make captain and hand him a 5 year contract.

We're worlds away from them in terms of our footballing IQ (in regards to running a successful club) at the moment.

3626~~~
When I read English speaking forums I always see stuff like "we just need that one player and we'll be good" "[proven] player x is rubbish / average / a coward" "[proven] player x is a fraud" "x contributes nothing". Modern football doesn't work like that, players very rarely dominate teams on their own. When the offense is as lethargic and dysfunctional as United's the problem isn't that one of the CMs doesn't rampage through midfield. 
Schweinsteiger looked a lot better at Bayern because they are/were a functioning team where players had a great positional understanding/movement to open up spaces and opportunities for passes. United often look like the opposite of that so it's no surprise that pretty much every single player is looking worse than back when he was playing in a functioning team. 
If you look at recent examples you could read almost the same about Evra and Kagawa and now they seem to do quite well for better teams.

3627~~~
Reminds me of a midfield Wayne Rooney. Can't trap a bag of sand at times and resembles a bulldozer.

3628~~~
He is blamed for things that he never is or was here. That is the problem. I think some here need a life. Schweinsteiger is not the reason for the series right now - he just played in one of the last matches and was not the recent 3 before. And the match yesterday with him was good and looked a lot better than the 3 before - and with this I do not even want to judge his own performance. Yes, it was not won - but let just one of the chances be in the goal (and it was just about milimetres) the whole talk in this forum is totally different...

Some her just need to have a scapegoat.

Schweinsteiger right now is in a good form - better than ever since that night in Brazil and in the whole time between the CL final in London 2013 and Brazil. But some seem to see things in him he never was or has been.

For me your match yesterday - I have not seen everything but about 50 % as I was jumping from one thing to another yesterday - looked a lot better than the recent weeks. It had again structure and you saw LvGs handwriting and not the I-do-not-know-what-to-do-as-I-am-so-full-of-fear-match of the recent weeks. And even if no United goal was scored - there was one really big positive - the opponent did not either. In the worst times of Bayern in the recent 6 years - not even with van Gaal but then with Heynckes in his first year - not scoring a goal in the first 60 minutes usually meant that the opponent will score and we for sure will not be able to make a comeback no matter what will happen - and it needed a long time to get this pattern out of the team. It was an early goal and highscoring - or total failure. (I know that a lot of people and especially Bayern fans seem to have forgotten that. It is always good to remember this matches.)

You have something to built on (and that is what I doubted when I looked at parts of the last matches before yesterday).

3629~~~
Spot on.

3630~~~
Schweinsteiger has not been in 'good form'. If this is the best he's been since 2013 then we've been had.

3631~~~
It's not spot on at all. He's praising Bastian for adding solidarity against a side who are 16th in the league and were playing with no striker. They had the biggest chance of the match. And Terry's header was probably joint second with Herrera's. We were better than we have been, but it was almost a given considering how Chelsea set up. There's no foundation that can be built on. It's another false dawn- if you can even call a 0-0 against one of the worst sides in the league that.

3632~~~
I think he played pretty well but tired badly in the second half and should have been subbed. What on earth is going on with his conditioning.

3633~~~
Maybe you should be as critical to all players...

3634~~~
I'm more critical to the ones I expect things of. For instance, I'm one of the few after the game who commented on Smalling's relatively poor game, because I expect a higher standard of him. Most of the side I expect very little from. A player of Basti's stature must show more.

3635~~~
That doesn't make any sense in a thread about Schweinsteiger. We pretty much walked the league easily at the beginning of Heynckes' first season until Schweinsteiger got injured in the game against Napoli and Heynckes had to reorganise the whole side.

We were already playing better than we ever did under van Gaal, were top of the league, 5 points ahead of Dortmund with 30 goals scored and only 3 conceded after 11 games and dominated the CL group with City and Napoli. Then Schweini wasn't available, we quickly lost against Mainz and Dortmund in the league and the problems became more and more obvious. Schweinsteiger never fully recovered that season after an ankle injury soon after he returned again forced him to sit out for a 6-7 weeks. Once he finally returned for good in late March, we had fallen behind Dortmund and couldn't catch up anymore and the matches against Real showed that Schweinsteiger wasn't fit enough yet to lead the team. Luckily Kroos stepped up big time in the CL semifinal or else we wouldn't have reached the final.

3636~~~
Oh stop. 

Chelsea have shown over the last 10 years that with or without a manager they can perform to certain level when it comes to playing the big teams. We played well yesterday but the goal never came, it happens.

3637~~~
In regards to previous comments, I don't think he's really been getting used as a 'scapegoat' at all. People are just highlighting the fact that he's often not offered us a lot in midfield, looks a shadow of the player he once was, and hasn't been overly exciting or adventurous in his passing.

That's not scapegoating him. That's just making perfectly valid criticisms. I see it in the Fellaini thread a lot as well, as a defence whenever he's horrendously out of position in midfield, or has an all-round terrible game, and people highlight it. If a player is being scapegoated, then he's generally being singled out for criticism above all other players, whose flaws are thus being ignored. That's not the case for us, since players like Rooney, Depay, Darmian, Fellaini and others have probably (and rightfully) come in for a lot more criticism than Schweinsteiger.

3638~~~
That is something that does not have anything to do with Schweinsteiger even if I mentioned it in his thread... - do not mix things. I will tell you later what I meant with that as I just have too leave house now.

3639~~~
It's fine when it happens on occasion...not when it's happening week in/week out, and seems to be turning into a regular staple of our season...when we're not getting beaten, that is.

We played some decent stuff at times yesterday, and probably should've won. Problem is though, that's not really good enough at the moment. The Chelsea side we were up against look dreadful right now, and seemed relatively content with a draw in the latter stages of the game to an extent.

It's up to players like Schweinsteiger to offer an incisive contribution which helps us to score goals and win games. It's not really overly impressive for him to be <i>alright </i>against a dire Chelsea side. Granted though, he's far from the worst of our problems, because whereas I think Schweinsteiger's mostly only been alright, with some good games and poor ones, we've got other players who have been actively terrible throughout the season. Schweinsteiger definitely does need to step up his game, though.

3640~~~
I still think he's one of the prime culprits for slowing down our play. He wants forever on the ball. You could see that Chelsea were inviting our defenders to give the ball to Schweinsteiger before they swarmed him to start counter attacks. Other teams are recognising his weaknesses now.

3641~~~
He isn't scapegoated at all on here, wtf are you reading? You should check the other player performance threads, most get slaughtered and criticized way more. The fact that it is your beloved Schweinsteiger who noone should dare to criticize that gave you this conclusion.

I think most agree that United are definitely more solid and the game is better structured when he's playing. The good defensive record has at the beginning of the season had a lot to do with the partnership of Schneiderlin-Schweinsteiger.
But on the other hand - and most probably agree with that as well - he hasn't really lived up to his expectations either. While some has to do with the way Van Gaal wants his team to play (I actually think playing a CM in VGs setup is a horrible task, especially with some of the players around), some is also down to Schweinsteiger simply playing below his level as well right now.
No need to write him of but now need to be happy about his performances as well either.

3642~~~
But our problems in Heynckes' first season were 100% related to Schweinsteiger getting injured? It totally hurt our balance in the team, Kroos had to play deeper, because neither Tymo nor Gustavo could offer enough in the build-up from deep and we again had the massive disconnection between attack and defense that caused us so many problems under van Gaal.

It's not surprising that Schweinsteiger can't play on that level anymore and to me it looks as if he's trying to do it or van Gaal asks him to do it, instead of adjusting his role in a way that suits his physical condition today. I wouldn't read too much in a game against a Chelsea side that's even more flawed than United. I agree that Schweinsteiger gives a lot structure to the team that's clearly missing without him. But that doesn't change the fact that he's still underwhelming, far from performing great.

This I disagree with for these reasons. The midfield set-up is still flawed, because if it depends on an ageing and often underwhelming player who looks clearly past his peak, especially physically, to have at least a bit of structure against an opponent in awful form, then that's a problem and certainly nothing to build on.

3643~~~
He needs replacing in the first team.

3644~~~
He's a good player and a true leader on the pitch, there's no denying that. The problem is that we need a different kind of midfielder to make our midfield a bit more functional. In that sense, we made the same 'mistake' when we signed Di Maria. Angel had the best season of his entire career in Madrid when he had the role of the wing man to the other star players Real had up front. We broke the bank and expected him to become the focal point in our attacking plays which is something he's not comfortable with. Now he's at PSG and he's providing a shitload of assists and through balls for all the quality players who consist PSG's attacking force.

Same thing with Bastian. What we truly need in our midfield is a b2b midfielder with ball carrying and play making abilities, someone like Modric. A player who would link the midfield with offense and become the 'extra man' on both sides of the pitch. The days when Schweinsteiger could do that at top level are behind him. We saw it in the WC that he can still offer some world class performances in a deeper role, more like a holding midfielder. That's why Pep let him go, he would have to bench him a lot because at Bayern the role of the more creative midfielder is reserved for Alcantara and Alonso is the first choice holding player (with Martinez also back from injury).

In 2015 Schweinsteiger is much 'heavier' player on the pitch, less mobile and aggressive, a player who needs more time on the ball than usual and therefore a liability when given instructions to influence the play from more advanced positions. We saw that against Barca last season and we've seen it during his time at OT too with yesterday's game being a fine example.

When he's playing next to Carrick, it's like having two players occupying the same spaces and trying the same things. When he's playing alongside Scheneiderlin, Morgan operates as a defensive midfielder in our half and leaves all the play making to Bastian. Herrera could be utilized there but LvG doesn't trust his passing and positioning in deeper areas (one of the things the manager actually has a point) plus Ander's a pass n' move player more than a ball carrier or a deep lying play maker. The 'Fellaini experiment' is one of the reasons we haven't won a single match all this time and we have lost the defensive stability we had.

Bastian can give us two more quality seasons  as a holding player now that Carrick's probably retiring but we need to sort out the rest of the midfield in order to put his abilities and leadership skills to good use.

3645~~~
Oh yeah I agree with you that what we've show in the last few weeks has not being good enough, but with that in mind why was anyone expecting anything different yesterday. As already mentioned regardless of form Chelsea can put in a decent performance when it comes to playing big teams, anyone expecting it to click and come together yesterday was always going to be upset.


As for Schweinsteiger he's doing ok and yes maybe he should be doing better but add in all the different factor(First season at United and in England, first time not having a winter break, the form of the team as a whole)and it's at least understandable why he hasn't been Keane 2.0

3646~~~
Much like Carrick I don't think he has the legs for a 2 man midfield these days, both need 2 CM's in there with them to let them just sit and focus on their passing while others cover the grass.

3647~~~
Looks like our club has fecked up again. We have Schweinsteiger, Carrick, Herrera, Blind (don't forget he is actually a CDM), Fellaini and Schneiderlin for the midfield spots yet we can't actually put out a good midfield combo

3648~~~
Very good post. I think you've just about hit the nail on the head. Schweinsteiger's past his prime, certainly, but still has certain qualities we could make use of. Problem is, LVG (like with most of our team) doesn't know how to fit him into the team properly, and doesn't know how to make use of those particular qualities.

3649~~~
Keep playing him with Schniederlin and Herrera and let them do the running for him. This won't happen though.

3650~~~
What passing?
Schweinsteiger's passing isn't special at all. 

If you're going to have a guy in there passing, he needs to actually be brilliant at passing and injecting pace into attacks with one/two touches.

3651~~~
Schweinsteiger is a good passer of the ball and I think we'd see him implement it more effectively if we had a screen in front of him.

3652~~~
It's becoming clearer and clearer that the plan A for this season was to 'copy & paste' the Saints' tactics from their previous season. They had two hard working midfielders in Morgan and Wanyama who could cover acres of space on the pitch, fullbacks who could provide width and three players with distinctive roles up front (Mane, Tadic and Pelle). I think that's the logic behind the change of formation from LvG this season.

The problem is that neither Carrick or Schweinsteiger can partner Schneiderling effectively in our midfield. Not because Wanyama is better on the ball but because he can run with the ball, he's more agile and dynamic and can go forward without thinking of the space he leaves behind every time he's in the final third. Both our holding players like to sit deep and dictate the tempo and that leaves Schneiderlin with more responsibilities in the attacking half than he should have.

As for the attack, Pelle can provide good hold up play and he's a threat in the box, Mane starts from wide positions and takes on defenders while Tadic operates more as an advanced play maker, hence all the assists he had last season. In our team Rooney is invisible in the box and concedes possession all the time, Memphis/Young/Lingard rarely get past their man, Martial is utilized either as a central or as a wide forward because he's the most talented player we have on the ball and in our poor attack he has to do a bit of everything and Mata looks like a second striker who is struggling to become a play maker because he can't operate under pressure and needs more spaces and time on the ball.

3653~~~
Schwein plus a few quid for Danny Drinkwater would be a good deal. 
Seriously, Leicester fans I know say he's crucial to them.

3654~~~
sad thing is he used to be our player...

3655~~~
He should be played ala Pirlo to get the best out of him with two more mobile players in front of him.

Bastian as a #6 with Herrera + Morgan at #8.

3656~~~
Yup, that's why Barkley, Wilshere, Llanna, Kane and Alli are rightfully being called the new breed of talent. They aren't afraid and have the technique/ability to turn on the ball and receive in tight spaces. 

Herrera has good technique but half of his scrappiness is because he's taking responsibility and trying to force the issue (even when he's getting closed down/there is limited space/the opposition is set up to counter). And for me the same but to a lesser extent goes to Mata. 

Until we have a decent right (and left if we play Martial up top) winger and another striker, we won't see the full 'effectiveness' of Mata's ability. He's shown he can get away from presses and in tight spaces but his execution is iffy due to a combination of factors like personnel and the actual positions he receives the ball.

3657~~~
A bit early days for that sort of trade, don't you think? Like every player on the team bar DDG he's performing below par, I think a boost of confidence instilled by a new coach would raise his and everybody's level considerably. Right now I am missing his long range passing game completely - that can't be up to physical decline. I expect a sharp upswing in form once we get closer to Euro 2016, otherwise there would be no way for him to secure his place in the German starting 11.

3658~~~
Balu spared me the time of writing a post of my own.

3659~~~
Anyone noticed how he's never trying any hard through balls these days? When he first started playing for us he was very positive in his passing, always trying to find players in good positions, now he is mostly content with keeping the ball and safe passing. Looks like the philosophy got to him.

3660~~~
Regardless of whether or not he is the player he used to be, we are still miles better with him in the team. He is the one true leader we have, and the team seems to have a little bit of purpose when he plays. We have no leadership and no purpose/structure when he doesn't.

3661~~~
I'd like to see this.

3662~~~
The coach is Löw... What are you dreaming of?

If you ask me what I am dreaming of... - some injuries would be helpful for the German team. The right injuries at the right time. Best connected with an injury crisis in Stuttgart, Hoffenheim and the whole Baden-Württemberg, Saarland...

3663~~~
He is playing, right? Honestly haven't seen him in the game at all apart from when he got fouled.

3664~~~
Maybe the slowest player ever to play in our midfield.

3665~~~
YEah he's been anonymous. Would do better with carrick second half. Looks like he's playing left wing or something

3666~~~
Stop the bad backheels.

3667~~~
Aye <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3668~~~
Bayern conned us again.

3669~~~
We missed him when he was out. How anybody cannot see that is beyond me.

3670~~~
It feels like I was watching a different game, I thought he was good today.

3671~~~
Not really, Pep actually said they felt his legs had gone. I think Bayern were happy for it to end as it has, nothing worse than seeing a former great player decline at his club.

3672~~~
I only watched the 2nd half but he did well there. Involved in both goals scored today as well.

3673~~~
I was joking.

3674~~~
He had a stretch in the second half where he looked like the Schweinsteiger of old. Then he had some easy passes he simply botched. Overall he was solid.

3675~~~
Kept the attacks alive for both goals.

3676~~~
Some are just overly harsh. He does well for us. Him out hurt us more than most see.

3677~~~
Probably the first home game he's had a genuine impact on things that matter. He falls on his arse a lot though.

3678~~~
I thought he played well today.

3679~~~
Basti is a real privilege to have at our club. Any fan that thinks we paid for the Basti of 3 years ago needs to stop playing video games. What we have brought in, is a player that gives us what no player in the club can offer, leadership and intelligence. His legs have gone but I was impressed by impact on those around him. I had a giggle when he was shouting at players and directing the play while the ball was half way across the pitch. As long as he is fit, he should play. You can't buy his experience for even £50m in today's market.

3680~~~
He was poor in the first but improved a bit in the second, his lack of mobility puts a lot of work on his midfield partner defensively though.

3681~~~
Much better today I thought. Still not back to his best but I also feel that his fitness levels improved

3682~~~
He did decent second half, but kept the move alive for our first goal. Honestly think we should go back to what we were doing early season, swapping him and Carrick more (subbing one for the other to keep them both fresh).

3683~~~
I think he's a large part of our problem, i.e. pedestrian play... yes, he controls the game, but he also slows it down considerably. Most of the time I just can't see what he adds (leadership aside) what Schneiderlin/Herrera as a midfield two couldn't. Still happy to have him in the squad, but it's backed up by numbers that we're too negative with him and Morgan together in a midfield two.

3684~~~
He really ran a lot today i thought, he was always running into the box, which i really liked. Sure not every touch is perfect and he doesnt win every tackle, but he tries and we need to manage him better, instead of playing him or Carrick until they are tired, then rotating them when it is too late. He was much more positive in the 2nd half with his passing

3685~~~
I don't think he is doing us any favours in midfield at the moment, he's incredibly slow.

There was one instance in particular where he picked up the ball in acres of space and should've either made a quick pass or ran with the ball. Instead, he stopped in his tracks and the Swansea man dispossessed him with ease.

3686~~~
Thought he was disappointing yet again.

3687~~~
This has crossed my mind more and more recently.

There were 2 examples of this in the second half today. One where we were on the break and he was behind further forward breaking players with his arms out calling for the ball. I want to see that ball swung in front of the on running players. Not cut back to him so he can play it across to the opposite wing while they get 11 men behind the ball.

The second incident he was at the front of the break with Rooney on the ball out wide. As he got to the box he cut back and ran back to the outside of the box, leaving Rooney with no options. Sometimes it feels like he's more interested in keeping possession, rather than taking a risk which may result in a goal.

3688~~~
Played well? I thought he was terrible, so slow and can't seem to stay on his feet.

3689~~~
he has seriously put weight on even in those 3 games off

3690~~~
Not a shock that with him back in the line up our midfield has looked more solid.

Great second effort tackle on our first goal.

3691~~~
No matter how he is playing I always feel like we're more likely to win with him on the pitch than without. I guess that's what having the captain of the World Cup winners brings to a team.

One thing you can never fault him for is effort and passion, and that gives the rest of the players a lift. 

I also noticed today that he seemed to be offering a lot more off the ball than a lot of our players, getting into good space to receive a pass.

3692~~~
I just shake my head every time I come into this thread. Some people refuse to see what he offers because his name isn't Carrick.

3693~~~
Thought he was good again. Pleasure to watch. Rest him in the cup.

3694~~~
Teams aren't walking through our midfield as they were during  his 3 match suspension

3695~~~
Poor today but has looked good at other times this season so can forgive. 

Another CM should be on the agenda in summer, think BS could still be useful closing out games next season, so graceful on the ball

3696~~~
More to do with Schneiderlin who missed the same 3 games.

3697~~~
Love him but fck me he has declined so much as a player. He seems to have lost most of his mobility. It's sad to see. He's not even that old

3698~~~
Why has LVG stopped rotating him and Carrick? I thought that was one of his better thought-out plans earlier on. Now Schweinstieger just looks knackered all the time.

3699~~~
He was alright, I guess. Impacted the game in a positive way which was nice. But he has definitely declined. Just seems to lack something.

3700~~~
Carrick is also criticized on here, there is no agenda, they are both old and legs are gone, Schweini do have a little bit more mobility left in him though.

3701~~~
We he wouldn't be here, certainly not at the price we paid, if he hadn't declined. Still a very valuable player to have on the team.

3702~~~
His passing range is disappointing right now and that's got nothing to do with age and quickness. He used to pass the ball long with very good accuracy plus play a lot more high risk high reward through balls than he does now. He's either not fully confident to express himself or been told to keep it very simple with short passes to keep the possession game ticking.

3703~~~
only halfway through the season aswell

3704~~~
Agree Carrick was my favourite player but his legs have slowed down considerably. Great squad player but creaking a bit. Bastian has much more in the tank and I'm delighted we signed him. The difference when he plays is stark in terms of composure. Bastian and Morgan should be the two names on the team sheet every week for our midfield.

3705~~~
We don't tend to get beaten when Schweinsteiger plays. Yes, he's not at his peak anymore, but he's one of the few players in our squad with a bit of backbone. He played a pretty underrated role in our opening goal yesterday.

3706~~~
It's so obvious that he and Schneiderlin is our best combination.

3707~~~
Morgan is getting pelters in his own thread though

3708~~~
Seemingly for not doing Schweinsteiger's job for him.

3709~~~
Wasn't very good yesterday, but I feel much better with him in the team than when he's not.

3710~~~
He's not the Schweinsteiger we expected. But I agree with a few points on this thread.

1) He's doesn't take as many risks as he did at Bayern or even the start of the season. He used to have quick feet at Bayern combined with good agility but that side of his game seems to have left him which is understandable considering he is no longer a winger/has had a few bad injuries/ is the wrong side of 31. However at the start of the season, he was attempting a lot more through balls or dangerous passes but he seems very reluctant to try it now. He will occasionally switch the play 30-40 yards but not incisive like we seen against Brugge or the earlier season game.

2) We seem to look much better as a team with him on the pitch. His leadership skills and running of the midfield I always thought were overstated but looking at the last few games, it seems to be true of him or maybe it's the presence of Schneiderlin in the midfield and actually having someone dynamic in there. It's a subjective observation and can't really be measured as to what his presence offers. His overall game to be fair has been mediocre up to now.

3711~~~
He played the preassist to the second goal, too.

3712~~~
I have the same feeling too.  And he needs Schneiderlin  shielding the defence too rather than Carrick. His obvious contribution is always his pressing up the pitch and also the cool head he has in dealing with pressure.

3713~~~
Schweinsteiger is actually the kind of player people think herrera is. Always looking to get forward and always putting in those gritty challenges. He never seems to give up. For instance most would have given up after a slip but he mnaged to nick it off to Young in our buildup to the first goal. He is very gritty and passionate. Of course he isnt the player he was. Doesnt mean he is bad

3714~~~
I know there's a lot of focus on Rooney being an automatic starter but Schweinsteiger being guaranteed to start every game is almost as baffling.

3715~~~
I think he's quality and not his problem he has Mata and Rooney who can't run in front of him.

3716~~~
He doesn't pass the ball forward very much anyway. When he does try something more ambitious it usually fails. And his level of fitness is appalling. He's been given a free ride.

3717~~~
he is the only one in our midfield who is showing something even close to passion. And he keeps cool even under pressure and rarely loses possession. He deserves to start.

3718~~~
He's not doing enough, you'd like to think it's not because he can't anymore.

3719~~~
Injured. Feck.

3720~~~
That looked really bad...

3721~~~
hes done for season, poor him tried his best to win it but his start is even worse than scholses

3722~~~
He's back on

3723~~~
I can see<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> it looked really nasty

3724~~~
Of course he rarely loses possession. He takes zero risks.

3725~~~
He's better off the pitch than struggling on here

3726~~~
He is injured, isnt he? Think he will be out for quite some time

3727~~~
Yeah it did, thought he was fecked.

I think playing on is only gonna make it worse anyway.

3728~~~
He might be pretty much risking his career staying on. Feel sorry for him.

3729~~~
What happened? Anyone got a gif? I can't watch the game.

/edit: found it in the match thread

3730~~~
he takes way too many risks. Even in our box he dribbles past other strikers. As for forward, he gets into the box way too much for a DM

3731~~~
There isn't a defensive midfielder in the league who couldn't replicate his passing range.

3732~~~
Hope he's okay. We need him.

3733~~~
you are entitled to your opinion, but no way has he been poor and undeserving of start.

3734~~~
But you think Van Gaal is doing a good job so we obviously expect vastly different things on the football pitch.

3735~~~
I feel sorry for him.

3736~~~
His passing is just simply garbage. He can't play the controlling from deep role for shit.

3737~~~
I dont think he is doing a good job at all. I just like winning however we do it. And I choose not to cry all the time like you as well even at the smallest of things

3738~~~
He was our best player today. only one to always show for the ball, only one to be trying to get people moving for him and one of the only ones who was professional enough to actually give a damn about the game.

3739~~~
Who's crying? If you think Schweinsteiger has been good then knock yourself out but you've already proven you have a lower standard of what you want to see from Utd. If you like watching a clearly unfit player plodding about the pitch playing nothing but the simplest pass available then that's up to you.

3740~~~
Thought it was one of his better games, intercepted passes well, supported the attacks and moved the ball crisply. Not his fault that LvG picked a team with no wingers against a side fully content with parking the bus. Him and Ander were at times occupying the same positions and Fellaini started popping up on the flanks.

3741~~~
One of our best player today actually

3742~~~
Hopefully the knee was just jarred, I thought it was going to be the ligaments when they showed the replay, it bent right back. I imagine he'll definitely rest out the Newcastle game.

3743~~~
He was a bit meh. We seem to be better with him in the team but he doesn't really do a lot.

3744~~~
I'm continually underwhelmed by him. The quality is there but I think LVG is really stifling him as he seems to be playing by numbers instead of just playing.

3745~~~
LVG: "Everyone thought it was his ankle, except for me, I knew it was his knee."  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3746~~~
I guess you must probably be blind if you think thats what he does most games. Our 2 goals in the previous swansea game involved a good contribution from him for instance. He can play better but he is the only one among our midfielders who try something. I guess someone like you wont be happy if Messi makes a back pass too and will probably doubt his abiities

3747~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3748~~~
Sure buddy.

3749~~~
He most certainly does not try things. What are you watching? He's the most unambitious passer I think I've seen play regularly in our midfield. The end of your post shows how weak your point is.

3750~~~
This guy always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. But he doesn't know he's the butt of everyone's jokes.

3751~~~
Is there any chance of seeing him in the team on Sunday?

3752~~~
Missed his leadership today

3753~~~
I fecking hope so. He was noticeable by his absence.

3754~~~
No news on a return for tomorrow then?

3755~~~
If ever there was a single sentence to describe Van Gaal's need to appear special and clever, this is it.

3756~~~
I do not want to be disrespectful towards Schweini but I guess from nowadays Point of view there won`t be too many Bayern supporters still thinking it was wrong to sell him.
There has already been some critics during the past years that he tends to slow down the Play of Bayern. Others have been calling this "calming down the game".
I still think he was worth the Price we paid but it is very clear that he does not solve any of our real Problems.

3757~~~
The "real problem" IMO is our attack. There's no way Schneiderlin, Carrick and Schweinsteiger can't play passes Henderson, Lucas and Can, can. (can can can can)

3758~~~
Our attack is capable of much better movement and counter attacking football. The problem on a whole are the tactics LVG has been instilling. They turn our midfielders into reserved robots and our attackers into indecisive muppets, because they seem to be almost afriad of making that key pass, shot or run. They are all better than that, I don't care what anyone says.

3759~~~
Now that Mata is not in first 11 anymore probably Schweiny would try making those long range passes with Martial and Lingard making the runs. Probably Rooney too now that he is in scoring form.

3760~~~
Just like with Schneiderlin, I'd like to see him with Herrera next to him (or in a 4-1-4-1 formation). I think it's difficult for any deep midfield player to make a difference offensively (which is where both players are struggling) when there's such a huge gap between the two holding players and everyone else, with little pace and movement. Nine times out of ten they have 3 options: play it out to our full backs, play it back to our defenders or hoof it upfield.

I think the following would benefit our whole team (although the tactics would have to be more progressive to match):

<span style="color: #ffffff">_____</span>Schwein/Schneid
Depay Herrera Mata Martial
<span style="color: #ffffff">________</span>Rooney

or

Schwein/Schneid Herrera
Depay Mata Martial
<span style="color: #ffffff">_______</span>Rooney

Likewise I think Mata having Herrera, Martial and Depay around him would benefit us hugely. Unfortunately I think Van Gaal wants a much more defensive setup that this, even at Old Trafford against mediocre opposition.

3761~~~
Mata hit a dodgy patch of form and was dropped, rightly, but he will be back in soon as he is still our most creative player.

3762~~~
And that's the problem! If Mata is our most creative player we are in a bad way as he's stone average!

3763~~~
I don't agree. Nor I think would most fans who have seen what Mata can do.

3764~~~
Really? What a disappointment for me since he's joined I expected much more.

3765~~~
Hes a good player for us, but in terms of creativity, he has been nothing special in a United shirt IMO

3766~~~
Underwhelming at times but we do seem to be more creative when he's playing. Maybe underwhelming isn't the right word because he hasn't got the quality around him that he had at Bayern.

3767~~~
I was talking about Mata there, but yes I agree Bastian has underwhelmed.

3768~~~
Sorry.

3769~~~
We have no control of any game when hes not playing. Ive seen some criticism of him this season, but apart from Arsenal (think he was paired with Carrick), weve at least had control and tried to play on the ground with him.

3770~~~
Yup agree, we need him back ASAP.

3771~~~

3772~~~
Sky Germany says that he will be back end of February. That he had a partial rupture of the medium ligament.

3773~~~
feck

3774~~~
No injury update in the presser yesterday?

3775~~~
He was in Munich on Monday because of the merchandising day of the German National team and he probably visited Müller-Wohlfahrt then. Or even still might e there as the photo of Usain Bolt he posted today on his twitter is from the doctor's place.

3776~~~
I dread to think the size of him his next appearance

3777~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-injury-news-schweinsteiger-10814193" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...er-united-injury-news-schweinsteiger-10814193</a>

MEN Reporting he's out for another month.

3778~~~
Need him and Carrick back ASAP if we're getting top 4.

3779~~~
He's been poor most of the season, don't think we've missed him that much.

3780~~~
I think we have. We've been forced to use Fellaini who isn't a CM into.

3781~~~
Can't agree at all with that assessment. He has not been as good as he can be but the only game I remember in which I found him poor was the away match in Wolfsburg. Since he's been either injured or suspended, United's results have declined, and so has the football. Not saying that's only because of his absence but IMHO it's one piece of the puzzle.

3782~~~
Its quite a big piece, even though he hasn't imposed himself on our attacking play enough, its clear we miss him a lot

3783~~~
LOUIS VAN GAAL admits he had to persuade the Manchester United board to sign Bastian Schweinsteiger last summer.

The World Cup winner was the biggest name arrival at Old Trafford, signing from Bayern Munich in a £6.5m deal.

And Van Gaal has revealed that the 31-year-old's age meant he had to convince United's hierarchy that Schweinsteiger was worth buying.

The German has endured an injury-disrupted debut campaign with the Red Devils but Van Gaal believes he can recapture the form that made him one of the best midfielders in the word.

"Manchester United has bought him even though he is now 31, so I had to convince the board to buy him, because he’s a very good player and he always gives a team more balance," Van Gaal said.

"He played very well at Wolfsburg and then began to reach the level he showed at Munich – I think he can [get back to it].

"Bastian has been unlucky because he picked up an injury at a time that he was playing very well – he was improving.

"However, during December I said that I expect more and he was very disappointed I said that, but I think I can say that because my expectation is higher."

3784~~~
So when is he back?

3785~~~
I still can't believe he plays for us. I just typed his name in Google images and seeing him in a united shirt seems so odd.

 Can't wait to get him back tbh.

3786~~~
he's been decent, and we look better with him in there then not.

But still, we're not talking huge margins,

3787~~~
We're better with him but he has been average individually at best. His leadership and tactical nouse must be vital, hope we have him back soon.

3788~~~
Eh? He was really bad against Wolfsburg.

3789~~~
At no point did he reach the level he showed at Munich. LVG is deluding himself.

3790~~~
I doubt he needs to. What LVG considers good, doesn't often match up with most other people's expectations tbf.

3791~~~
No idea but currently he is in Dubai watching Ana Ivanovic play so I can't imagine him featuring for us in Feb.

3792~~~
He is just changing goalposts. As it happen sometimes over here: players become better while they are out. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

The last time he opened his mouth about him, he said something along the lines of "He is not the player I had at Munich" or something.

Edit: Sorry, I forgot. Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

3793~~~
This is van Gaal speaking. When something is obvious (that Schweinsteiger was poor at Wolfsburg), he will say the complete opposite to prove that he's a genius and everyone else is just pleb.

Really? That's kinda odd, isn't it? Shouldn't he be working on his comeback in United's facilities and stay with the team for the matches?

At least, he'll be well rested for the Euro in the summer <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

3795~~~
Really thought he'd excel here but he's been poor, to be honest.

I think he's just not fit enough - probably carrying an extra six to eight pounds with him. Look at him during the World Cup and compare that to his latest showing for us.

3796~~~
Football player having a life outside of football shocker. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3797~~~
Not the Memphis thread thing here again :|

3798~~~
It wasn't really meant as a big criticism. I just think it's a bit odd that he's away on vacation midweek. I'm the last person who would question Schweinsteiger's professionalism ffs. I do think it's unusual for injured players to fly around the world though. Didn't know it was such a big deal to point that out.

3799~~~
Why we signed him I'll never know, he's just another declining big name he's nowhere near the quality he used to be and hes done nothing for us either

There's a reason Bayern let him go to a rival (we were at the time) for peanuts

3800~~~
I know.. I was just over-reacting <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3801~~~
There is, he wanted to go and Bayern allowed him because he is their legend and they have respect for him. He was also in his last year of contract. We bought van Persie for peanuts too and he was at his best form of life and played for fecking Arsenal.

3802~~~
he is a leader and it is not to be underestimated how important he is for this current set of players. Yes, he may not be able to do a full 90 anymore but he can still boss the midfield and is just one of those names you look on the team sheet and other teams will fear. I want to see him adapt his game and just sit infront of the defence a la carrick and just pull the strings for united with good passing and positional play. Still could be a great signing for us. We need him back fit and playing.

3803~~~
LVG has given him a holiday. Said something about him need to change his mentality a bit. I think referring to him injuring himself with a crazy challenge? 

Sir Alex gave player holidays at random times in the season too. Often when they were injured (depends on the type of rehab) but sometimes when he just thought they needed a rest. They always seem to end up in Dubai though.

3804~~~
Fair enough, that explains why he's away.

3805~~~
Yes, there is a reason. He has been in the club since he was 14 and had one year contract left. And Bayern has other options. 

He was at Müller-Wohlfahrt end of January and the German media said he is out until end of February then. So it does not really matter if he spends that time in Manchester or elsewhere.

3806~~~
I don't see why any player would fear the current version of BFS. he just plods around the pitch. You could outpace him by walking. The likes of Kante would eat him up (admittedly he'd be eating for a while as theres a lot to dine on)

3807~~~
His contribution is quite underrated. It is not a coincidence, that the record with him in the team is way better.

3808~~~
I did not mean it to have a go at you, just feel a bit tired with the whole stuff, and as <a class="username" data-user="91612, @Classical Mechanic" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/91612/">@Classical Mechanic</a> already noted, he had some time off from LvG.

3809~~~
In your opinion. For the amount he's paid, I want to see him at our games cheering us on. Not Ana Ivanovic's. 

Plus, wasn't he bought partly for his off pitch contribution too? We're in an all hands on deck type situation, he should be contributing.

3810~~~
He's been everything I expected him to be. I'm kind of relieved that the club weren't sure about going in for him.

3811~~~
If LVG leaves at the end of the season maybe he will go with him. Nothing against 
Schweinsteiger but i think his best days are gone.

3812~~~
He wanted to leave Bayern because he knew his days were numbered there. There's a difference between signing one the best strikers in the world (he was when we signed him) and an ageing 
box - box midfielder that's legs have gone.

3813~~~
Fully agree. He was suspended for three matches during that awful 3 game run in December and as soon as he came back in we sured up again. Since he's been out this time we've had mixed performaces again.

His contribution to the team isn't overtly apparent at times but think he brings a composure and organisation to the team when he plays, especially for the defensive shape. I'm not saying he's electric but he clearly adds experience and knowhow into the team when he plays. 

At the end of the day he's not the player he was 5 years ago, that's for sure, but I certainly don't think he's been a bad signing.

3814~~~
He is a leader on the pitch and he brings the team up IMO. Unfortunately our other senior midfielder isn't cut from the same cloth.

3815~~~
When he plays he's the captain, and the leader of the side. We miss him badly.

3816~~~
Any idea when he is expected back?

3817~~~
When truly great players legs go it's a tragedy.

What it does show is how great a player they actually are, though, some can manage to change their game to adapt to their lack of pace. Schweinsteiger doesn't seem to be good enough to adapt his game, I've lost count of the times he's over dwelled on the ball this season. 

Get the ball and recycle play straight away, no messing about. Keane, Scholes and Xavi are perfect examples of players who's legs went yet they still dictated play. If he can't adapt his game he's no use to us, he's no longer the all action midfielder he once was.

3818~~~
I've lost count of time he has looked up and nobody is making a run in front of him.

I bet he'd have a good Euros for Germany.

3819~~~
Actually forgot that we had him. When is he due back?

3820~~~
He's good enough as long as there's more quality in our midfield. Right now our midfield is pure rubbish. Herrara and Schneiderlin have been performing way below the required standards. And Fellaini has been just Fellaini.

3821~~~
He's been bang average but then so has Morgan, Carrick and Herrera so obviously a byproduct of LVG's deficiencies

3822~~~
This. It certainly does not help him that we have a front line that is largely static.

3823~~~
<b><span style="font-size: 22px">Manchester United set to be without Bastian Schweinsteiger for a further four weeks as he continues to recover from a knee injury</span></b>

3824~~~
Great.

3825~~~
I just read on the injuries thread that he's 10 days away?! Confused

3826~~~
From Bastian himself:

<b>"A medial ligament tear takes time, but everything is healing well. I know my body, everything will be ok,” said Schweinsteiger. “In about five days, I’ll begin to start running again and five days after that I should be training with a ball again."</b>

3827~~~
Forgot all about him tbh

3828~~~
I don't understand why we didn't have him play as a fullback. He knows the position and I would definitely like to switch Blind and him around.

3829~~~
He'd be really useful on the pitch at the moment, if only for his leadership qualities. Team is sorely missing such profiles at the moment.

3830~~~
Agreed.

3831~~~
Because he's slow as feck and much too old to be pelting from one end of the pitch to the other and back for 90 minutes.

3832~~~
He's not what he was a couple of years ago but we've lost a lot by having him out.

3833~~~
I still think he's absolute quality. Its clear nobody is playing anywhere close to their best for obvious reasons.

3834~~~
All being well, he'll be back in three weeks or so.

3835~~~
Think this guy is a good presence to have around the team even if he's injured.

3836~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bastian-schweinsteiger-manchester-united-comeback-11008999" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...insteiger-manchester-united-comeback-11008999</a>

Back in training.

3837~~~
Louis confirms the above, again, too.

3838~~~
I have a weird feeling that he'll be amazing for Germany in the Euros this summer.

3839~~~
Probably. Germany are a far better side than us.

3840~~~
Meh.

3841~~~
If he makes the squad.

3842~~~
Strange one with Schweiny.

We all worried he wouldn't play that many games, but he was actually available most of the time.

But then he got what looked like a mid term injury, only to play on, and then the club implied he'd be back very soon.

Yet he seems to have now been out for months!

3843~~~
bad luck, think he fooked himself up good in the WC, kept on playing hurt. Hope for him and you fellas its not a "Jens Jeremies" situation.

3844~~~
Can't say I'm too fussed about having him back. He's a shadow of the player he used to be.

3845~~~
Agree. Doesn't fill me with any excitement to know he's back. Even worse knowing that Herrera-Schneiderlin grows less and less likely by the week.

3846~~~
According to this, he makes all the difference:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://soccerisma.com/2016/03/man-united-have-badly-missed-schweni/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://soccerisma.com/2016/03/man-united-have-badly-missed-schweni/?</a>

3847~~~
I'm on the fence on that one. He played most of his career in a successful,  established club. He's now in a team very much in transition so it's hard to compare. He's also a player in the same vein as Carrick who can offer a lot without notching up assists and goals.

3848~~~
I agree with this. Bastian is the leader of the team when he plays. We've missed a captain in the side in a bad way.

3849~~~
That is rather daft to isolate him alone and look at the team's points. For starters, he played most of his games alongside a set defense and an overall healthy team.

3850~~~
He's neither the world class superstar of years past, nor is he completely bereft of ability now. He's been a calming presence in many of our games this season, and has demonstrated the leadership qualities we all know he has. For instance, in the game where Shaw got injured, immediately after the injury the entire team looked disinterested and unfocused. Schweinsteiger in that game was the only player trying to rally the troops and inject some aggression back into our play. It wasn't enough, but I noticed it in that game and was very impressed. 

It'll be good to have him back, but please LVG keep the Herrera-Schneiderlin partnership as starters.

3851~~~
His ability now is only impressive relative to the absolute shitcannery of most of the rest of our side. He was a mistake.

3852~~~
I think he's been excellent for us. By no means is he the player he was 2-3 years ago but he contributes so much energy and leadership to our midfield.

3853~~~
Energy! he can't run..

He brings stability and calmness, but that's about it.

3854~~~
On the bench. Nice.

3855~~~
So far I think he's offered nothing but the ability to plod around the field. I guess one thing is that he's the only one who looks alright playing LCM, everyone else there drifts too high or moves to the right side a lot more.

3856~~~
I think he runs quite a bit.

3857~~~
Get him on and get him to instruct these clowns how to play football.

3858~~~
Lots of pointing=leadership
Being really slow=calmness

He's done very little so far

3859~~~
What kind of state is he in?

Reminds me of a retired player turning out for a charity game waddling around

3860~~~
Theres No way hes close to being fully fit. He only started training this week according to lvg

3861~~~
The body of a 60 year old man.

3862~~~
The best thing to come out of that game was his minutes and the start of match rythmn. We'll need him for the league games.

3863~~~
You insulting fecker, I'd give him a run for his money any day.

3864~~~
He created a chance at least, so there's that.

3865~~~
Need him fully fit somehow. Our midfield always looks better with him IMO despite his decline.

3866~~~
He is proper podgy. Kolo Toure-like proportions.

3867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3868~~~
I agree he has great self belief on the ball and will help guys like Morgan compose there self but I was hoping he'd come back in better shape (disappointing)

3869~~~
Along with Rooney should be shipped out this Summer.

3870~~~
Is he still here?

3871~~~
He was a chubster when he arrived and it only seems to be getting worse. Very disappointing.

I hope the reason for his nothing appearance last night was that he was asked to just get his foot on the ball, calm us down and stop us shipping any more goals.

3872~~~
The only saving grace with this signing is that he barely cost anything.

I'm not seeing any of the calmness or leadership he's supposed to be bringing in.

3873~~~
It was pretty clear that he won`t save our midfield Problems. Fecking Bayern had a laugh that another Club was willing to actually pay Money for him.

3874~~~
He played about 12 minutes in a game where we were completely over-ran, and set up a chance. I think the comments about yesterday in here are a bit OTT.

3875~~~
If anyone is judging by his cameo yesterday they need to get their heads straight..
He is a great player, might be a little leggy at times but he is being used like an 24 year old full of beans box to box cm.
Get him deep in the middle controlling tempo and passing it left,right and center you will see the benefits. As you will see this summer with Germany.

A new manager will find a great role for him as LVG is so stuck in the past he can´t change anything even if it is clearly not working.

3876~~~
Why was he playing with a couple of jumpers under his shirt???

3877~~~
Good post.

Getting players in their correct postions would make a massive difference. We've seen that with Mata going into the 10 role and how different Martial is on the left.

It's so simple that it makes LvG's refusal to do so even more frustrating.

3878~~~
I totally agree with you on that one..

3879~~~
Excellent post and I fully agree.

3880~~~
Last night's set up was baffling. Where was Rashford supposed to be playing; wide on the right or down the middle. No wonder he came off early.

3881~~~
Well I suppose Mourinho took Falcao on, so it's a possibility.

3882~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah that´s a bit baffling... Who knows but I for one am sure that Mou would have picked somebody else if he had been given the cash to do so...

3883~~~
Rashford was wasted because Varela had clearly been told to man mark Coutinho, so when Coutinho was coming infield it allowed Moreno to push forward and pin Rashford back.

The tactics were mind boggling. Fellaini, Schneiderlin and Mata as the three is bizarre. Mata had to keep dropping deep to try and get on the ball.

3884~~~
Right wing I think but when you can't keep the ball the wide players are more like fullbacks.

It's just so frustrating.  Certain players should only be used in certain positions. Schweinsteiger is the deep lying playmaker, Schneiderlin is box to box, Martial on the left, Mata and Fellaini at 10, Rojo centre back, Blind left back. They might not ultimately be good enough but at least you then get the best of them.

3885~~~
We paid £6.5m for him. Stitched us up good and proper didn't they?

3886~~~
+ his wages. Too much for someone who does not help us one bit.

3887~~~
He isn't a deep lying playmaker though, he can't dictate the game from deep for shit.

3888~~~
Just wanted to bring this here, I kind of agree (not about the BFS thing doesn't bother me) but about his status as a United player. I think if we had have signed this Schweinsteiger in say 2011 (not the prime BFS) when the squad was humming along nicely I think it would have appeared a better signing.

Bringing him into this already mess of a squad has been rendered a bit pointless and thus made his signing seem a bit underwhelming. The story I love, wanted to play for this team for years and left his boyhood club to fulfill a dream. I just wish the squad was built better than he could flip in and out of it rather than this silly time-share type thing he had going.

3889~~~
the point of him coming was to steady the ship, not break him in to a well oiled machine. First half of the season he was the natural leader, calming influence on the pitch. We were expecting box to box but that was our mistake

3890~~~
This makes too much sense for LVG to even try it.

3891~~~
It would have been a lot better to bring him into a well oiled machine rather than expect him to "steady the ship". Especially in a league as physical and as fast as the Premier League. Suicide really.

3892~~~
very good cameo.

3893~~~
Thought he did really well when he came on today. We've missed him.

3894~~~
Better than last showing, if we had a few more characters with his driven character......

3895~~~
Very, very good when he came on. Showed a lot of urgency and made some good challenges to help drive us forward.

3896~~~
I thought he played well when he came on. Played a bit quicker than he usually does which helped a lot.

3897~~~
Should start next match. Very good today.

3898~~~
Was ok at best. Pushing Randolph into the net was the sum total of his contribution.

3899~~~
Made a difference when he came on.

3900~~~
Nice cameo

3901~~~
Better in that advanced midfield role where he can use his nous and experience and not have to track back as much.

3902~~~
Played well. Showed a lot of urgency.He is a leader. He communicates with the team. BFS, Herrera and Morgan should be the midfield till the end of the season. But LVG won't let than happen.

3903~~~
Made a real difference. Great cameo.

3904~~~
He made some good tackles and passes too. Thought he did very well

3905~~~
Randolph ran into him, Webb was chatting nonsense. Good cameo though and he certainly doesn't go through the motions on the pitch, if only more players could follow that example.

3906~~~
Assume it'll be him and Schneiderlin on Thursday. I think we can turn that tie round

3907~~~
A sub that actually improved us. If it wasn't for the fact that Depay came on at the same time I'd start to worry that LvG's lost his gift.

A good cameo, and his *cough* intervention in the goal was absolutely key. If he wasn't on the pitch Martial doesn't score. We don't have another player that clever.

3908~~~
Rubbish. Schweinsteiger blocked him off. He knew exactly what he was doing there. And I'm grateful for it.

3909~~~
We need a quick goal and anything is possible. I'd love to see Memphis, Bastian, Herrera, Martial, Rashford all pushing forward and exploiting Liverpool's week defence.

3910~~~
Thought he was excellent when he came on. I'd start him Thursday.

3911~~~
Need to start the next game.No more questions.

3912~~~
Nah I disagree he had eyes on the ball from Herrea along with Antonio. You can't give a foul for that.

3913~~~
He's presence alone made the difference, he did more in the 15 mins he was on than Fellaini has last two games.

3914~~~
He changed the game for us. I don't care if he's slowed down a bit he's still 4 times the player Fellaini will ever be.

3915~~~
I said it before, but he makes our midfield better even if he's not as good as he was. If fit, should always be 1st choice.

3916~~~
He was offside anyway.

3917~~~
There's no way it was intentional. He didn't look at Randolph once and he got nudge from Antonio as he was running across and his natural momentum was to take the next step of course. 

Anyway he was really good when he came on.

3918~~~
Do you? I like your optimism pal.

I struggle to see us scoring 2 or more in a game at the moment. Arsenal was quite a surprise.

3919~~~
Changed the game and makes others around him raise their games, shame he's on his last legs.

3920~~~
Don't give up the day job mate, he was very good today

3921~~~
Completely agree,he's one of the few leaders we have. He has such an influence on our game, glad he's back. I'm sure Fellaini will start again in our next match though, Louis van Joke will continue to make ridiculous line ups. So many players playing out of position. Just waiting for Phil Jones to replace De Gea when he's fit again. God I hate Van Gaal.

3922~~~
Considering we've scored 3 against them in our last two home games then why not? I do think it's all a bit pointless though after seeing Dortmund play a few times though. Neither are going to win it.

3923~~~
Did really well and picked up great positions further forward. Needs to start against Liverpool and hopefully he stays fit for the run in, we might just pick up enough points to capitalize on Arsenal/City collapsing

3924~~~
The only winner we have at this club.

3925~~~
Came on with some fire that rallied the team I felt, and his urgency and passing helped us get back onto the front foot and push for the equalizer.

3926~~~
Despite giving it the whole "it's the Europa, and it's only last 16" face saver to Pool fans at work, I'd love us to have a deeper run into the competition.
Just can't see it. We look all tidy with the ball but no real flair.

Also that last home game was against a Rodgers team that was probably their poorest team in 20years here.

3927~~~
He really wasn't. It was a decent performance at best with his best contribution being a foul that wasn't called by an inept ref. Fellaini was terrible today though so Bastian didn't look as bad and slow as he normally does.

No surprise to see people flower him with ridiculous praise though. He could score 5 OG's and people would still praise his "drive" and "character" and so called "winning mentality" for no apparent reason.

3928~~~
He changed the game when he came on for that hairy lamppost.

Fully expect him to start vs the Scousers. He's got the winning mentality running through his veins. Surely he's a bit tubby but he's easily the most influential midfielder we have at the club, should be captain if he stays fit, in my opinion.

3929~~~
Looks overweight, Runs around like a bulldozer, doesn't bother tracking his man, makes a couple decent passes...Bastian fecking Schweinstegier. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3930~~~
He needs to start!
Everything changed when he came on.
Had he been on for longer, i would've given him MotM.

3931~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Glad Steiger is back. He just adds a certain drive and class to our team.

3932~~~
A midfielder that can move and has passing range. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3933~~~
He was very good when he came on and changed the game for us today, hopefully we will see him starting ahead of Fellaini for the reminder of the season.

One thing I will never understand is why he wasn't made captain last summer, he is the only real leader in our squad and I think a big problem this season has been the lack of players with a similar mentality in our squad.

3934~~~
He's physical, can tackle and has good range of passing. Nice to see a player that has all of those qualities. Sorely lacking everywhere else.

3935~~~
He's proper grey too.

3936~~~
Have a look at the general set of comments.

Maybe give those glasses a quick shine?

3937~~~
He was really good today.

3938~~~
Was interesting seeing him come into that more attacking midfield role today. Is that the first time he's played there since joining us? Normally he's one of the deeper midfielders, but he was quite good pushed up in a more attacking role today.

3939~~~
He should start against Liverpool.

3940~~~
Gamechanger, fact.

3941~~~
People who could not see how good he was needs glasses. He changed the game when he came on.

3942~~~
Yeah, him + Herrera with Carrick behind was better than him + anyone with one in front.

3943~~~
He really should be the captain.

3944~~~
He should. Mourinho to name him captain?

3945~~~
A fat Bastian is better than all our midfielders unbelievable but true!

3946~~~
In the advanced role you actually had some belief in the attacks again

3947~~~
Think that's been half the problem. You can only play so many defence splitting passes in a game when you're being told to play so deep.

3948~~~
Love him, the longer he's around the better.

3949~~~
Best player we've signed since van Persie, football god.

I bet Mourinho can't wait to work with him!

3950~~~
Bloody hope not

3951~~~
while schweini may be past his best his experience is much needed for most of our squad who hasn't had experience playing for a (supposed) top club.

why not?

3952~~~
He isn't good enough to be a starter next season. 'Club captain' or whatever, sure.

3953~~~
With the lack of experience we have in the squad now he is so important to us. I thought he was good when he came on, really got stuck in.

3954~~~
Just so much quality comes with him. .  Anyone who doesn't see that needs to have a trip to Specsavers and pick up a two for one deal asap.

3955~~~
Real leader for us. He dictates tempo and play for us and did so earlier in the season. I still see no problem with going back to him and Carrick swapping for each other whilst we have Herrera and Morgan playing ahead of one of them. It really should be what we need to do for every game until the end of the season (and what we all thought / wanted when the season started).

3956~~~
Martial and Shaw are miles better than him.

3957~~~
Top player and should start every game when fit. Will be needed for the replay.

3958~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3959~~~
Some of that pointing he did when he came on was first rate.

3960~~~
He was good in the minutes he played, he was always showing for the ball and most importantly he understood it was up to him to lead the youngsters on the pitch. It's also understandable why the most of our fans where delighted with his performance, they saw in him the character and the personality we severely lack nowadays on the pitch.

But i'm afraid this advanced role in the midfield won't work for us in the long term. Bastian, right now, is a rather 'heavy' footballer whose feet don't allow him to run up down the pitch and cover all the right spaces quickly enough. It's ok to try him in that role for a few minutes when we're chasing a goal and the opponent has dropped deep but under different circumstances it's a choice that will create more problems than the ones it will solve.

I'm saying this because LvG is constantly reshuffling the deck with the hope he will stumble across a working formula again. And i think that the right place for Bastian at his age is in front of the back four and not in the final third.

3962~~~
Shaw?

Shaw played a handful of games for us this season before injury, and whilst he looked good, he couldn't get into the side last year. I'm a massive fan of his but Schweinstegier when fit is on a different level to him.

3963~~~
He played just about every game he was fit for last season. Schweinsteiger has been largely poor for us, some 15 minute cameo doesn't change that. He is on a completely different level to Shaw, easily a few levels down.

3964~~~
He played 16 games in the league for us last year.

16.

3965~~~
Anyone notice how fat he looks?

3966~~~
I did, really unprofessional for players to let themselves go injured or not.

3967~~~
Ran Mata right to the wire for being the most useless player on the field. Instead of pointing today, he went at sat at CB.

And yeah, he's mega fat. And grey. Grey fatty.

3968~~~

3969~~~
So what? The youngsters in the dressing room are enthralled with his presence and leadership skills. Learning lessons in professionalism from him.

Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3970~~~
Unbelievable how bad his condition is, I'd be embarrassed as a manager to let him enter the field so overweight.

Rojo is carrying weight as well, it's as if they have just had three months of eating an partying.

3971~~~
Let's be honest the transfer has been a disaster. 

All things considered it was worth the risk so I'm not mad at the club for taking him on but he looks done at this level 

There's a slight chance that under a new manager he could perform a specific role with the right players around him but it'll be 1 game in 3 at best and thats only if he can stay fit however you'd have to say there's as much chance of him moving on as there is that happening

3972~~~
The guy has won everything there is to win with Bayern and Germany. He is on a holiday here, and by gosh, from the looks of it, he is having a ball. 

In sport, I have only seen some cricketers take field this unfit, never a footballer at a top club. It's disgraceful.

3973~~~
The first thing I said when I saw him coming on was how out of shape he looked.

When he retires he's gonna balloon!

3974~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3975~~~
Choosing him over Gündoğan and still ending up with the fat, injury prone German. I really do hate this season.

3976~~~
The guy clearly isn't having an issue with submersing himself in English culture.

The condition he is in is absolutely disgraceful.

How he can call himself an "athlete" is beyond me.

It's looking more obvious by the week that he is treating Old Trafford like a bloody retirement home, like others do LA Galaxy and other US Clubs. Absolutely discusting that he can come to the biggest club in the world and not take his fitness seriously.

He's gone from one of the best midfielders on the planet to a lazy fat bastard and he gets away with it because he has a flawless track record.

If I was manager I'd have him and Rojo doing laps around Manchester after every training session and have them on a strict diet with a salary cut.

<b>Bastian Schweinsteiger is a metaphor for how far Manchester United have fallen 
</b>
The entrancing red lights of Old Trafford continue to display greatness, indicating it remains a theatre of dreams and yet on nights like these, it is reduced to an old creaking stage by the presence of fading stars and those too green yet to meet the enormity of the surroundings.


Concealed behind the imaginary curtain that separates pitch from technical area sat Bastian Schweinsteiger, the legendary midfielder who may have only been a substitute, but is someone nevertheless that represents a curious metaphor for Manchester United’s problems.

Less than two years ago, he was arguably Germany’s most influential player in a victorious World Cup campaign. Months before, his previous European knockout game on this ground came for Bayern Munich in the Champions League and his dynamism was an outstanding feature of the encounter, enabling him to score the Bavarians’ away goal. He was later sent off in a 1-1 draw.

Schweinsteiger’s subsequent decline since has been spectacular and now, judging by his weight, he is paid in Eccles cakes. Although the United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, was keen to advertise shirt sale figures with Kitbag when it was revealed he had supposedly risen from 33rd to the fourth most popular player on the planet by moving to United, it has proven to be Bayern who were wisest to what was happening with their icon.

In sporting terms, the ruthlessness of Bayern and the misguidedness of United illustrate the difference between the clubs and how far one of them has fallen. Sir Alex Ferguson used to be able to sniff a player’s deterioration not by what he could no longer do going forward but by his inability to track back and regain a defensive position before damage was done. Mike Phelan, Ferguson’s assistant, remembers the day Roy Keane’s time as United’s captain was terminated when Ferguson leaned over to him during a training session after Keane surrendered possession, whispering, “He’s finished, Mike.” With that, Keane was gone.

Paddy Crerand, the 1968 European Cup winner, told United Review that Schweinsteiger had “changed the game in our favour” after his introduction in Sunday’s FA Cup draw with West Ham United, and yet Michael Carrick was still considered a better option than him from the start here, even though his contract is up in the summer.

Schweinsteiger’s struggles at United are not isolated. There is a wider recruitment issue. Had Morgan Schneiderlin or Memphis Depay been capable of justifying their huge fees by demonstrating any amount of inspiration, Schweinsteiger’s demise may have lay concealed for longer. It was significant that Schneiderlin and Depay were perched beside Schweinsteiger on the bench and so was Matteo Darmian. Of last summer’s signings, only Anthony Martial has the swagger of someone who is able to deal with the size of the club. He took on responsibility for the opening goal, striking confidently from the penalty spot.

In the end, Schweinsteiger was sent on, stomping about the midfield; being at the pitch of the ball but usually too late before the release. He was soon booked for fouling Adam Lallana after simple skill left him trailing. The sorry sight acted as another reminder of the era where it went so wrong for Liverpool, when one fanzine dubbed less decorated figures like Neil Ruddock, Julian Dicks and Paul Stewart, the “team of fatties.”

Graeme Souness realised his time was up as Liverpool’s manager back then when Bristol City came to Anfield in the FA Cup in 1994 and as he ate his routine pre-match snack of tea and toast in the old Moat House Hotel, a team talk by Russell Osman in the next room revealed the desperate view of his team by employees of a club from the Second Division.

Had Van Gaal planted listening devices at the Marriott Hotel on Wednesday night as Jürgen Klopp discussed prospects for the following day, surely he would have heard damning repeated warnings about Liverpool’s greatest threat being complacency rather than anything the opponent in front of them had to offer.

The way United play, indeed, you’d believe Roy Hodgson was in Old Trafford’s home dugout and though the year could be 2010, when Hodgson was at Liverpool, the football is antediluvian. When Liverpool’s supporters chanted about Paul Scholes being right, “Your team is shite,” the lack of response from the home stands perhaps reflected some form of agreement.

The last time United appeared as desperate as this, a three-day week was called and the lights went out across Britain. It proved to be a relegation season and though they will not go down this campaign, they stagger on a precipice that relatively is as grave as it was in 1974.

United have ignored the history’s warnings. From here, Liverpool already have already shown it is a long journey back to the top.

3978~~~
We needed an Anderson replacement.

3979~~~
Anybody else think that Chop on Lallana was lucky not to be a red? He really swang into him with quite some force, lucky he didn't hurt him properly. Looked really frustrated and was chasing shadows. TBF he was left in midfield all by himself though.

3980~~~
Not exactly been a great transfer but for the price we paid it was worth the risk and who knows, maybe under a less shite manager he could've excelled.

3981~~~
Other than under hitting a pass to Lingard that stopped a potential counter and firing one of those Ando rocket balls at Martial, I can't remember him doing much.

3982~~~
Bringing him actually resulted in complete loss of control.

3983~~~
We had no control before he came on.

3984~~~
Whoever plays in the number 10 role usually ends up anonymous in this system.

3985~~~
We had a tiny bit, but once he came on, it was all City.

3986~~~
No we didn't  We were hoofing it all over the shop before he came on and couldn't get our foot on it after the fact either.

3987~~~
Fixed it for you.

3988~~~
I agree. Didn't have the impact I expected. Surprised he played so high up when he come on. Doesn't really suit him. Expected Van Gaal to go with a 433, with Scheiderlin and Schweinsteiger above Carrick. As it was, he seemed to play as a 10, and didn't really get into the game. 

He's not everyones biggest fan, but we might as well put Fellaini on if we put Schweinsteiger there. At least he would have provided an out ball, and possibly held it up for us.

3989~~~
I've not noticed Carrick rifling passes in so hard that it they are hard to control, he's a more silky passer.

3990~~~
I didn't see the point of this substitution. He didn't really bring enough energy to press City enough.

3991~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/dw_sports" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DW Sports 

✔‎@dw_sports</a>
JUST IN: Bastian Schweinsteiger out with a knee injury. Did not train with German NT today. (via <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/JochenStutzky" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@JochenStutzky</a>)

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/dw_sports/status/712581501460811778" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">10:07 AM - 23 Mar 2016</a>

3992~~~
Again?

3993~~~
Maybe? We better hope him and Ander are fit after the break or good old Fellaini will be in there. Until a  Germany press conference we will not know the extent or if they just let him play and not train.

3994~~~
It's hard work carrying 17 stone around all day. Something had to give

3995~~~
Bild say that it's renewed right knee injury and he's going to be scanned in Munich.

3996~~~
This signing has been a predictable disaster. Old, slow, well past his best and massively injury prone.

3997~~~
Ridiculous that he hasn't retired from international duty. Lahm who has a much better injury record, saw it wise to retire.

3998~~~
It was nice to sign him, but years too late. Bayern saw us coming. I suppose at the cost it wasn't bad, but has not been much use. One goal and two assists.

3999~~~
Isn't he rumoured to be on £200k+ a week? It wouldn't surprise me if we only paid £6m for him.

4000~~~
I really don't think he's been that bad when on the field (remaining on the field has been the problem.) In the first half of the season, I found him to be a very reassuring presence on the field, and much more of a captain than our actual captain. But it was so very predictable that he wouldn't be able to stay healthy.

4001~~~
If he was going to stay healthy he would still be of use to Bayern. As someone said it is ridiculous that he didn't give international football up after the world cup

4002~~~
He's not on 200k a week. Daily Star made up that nonsense. German press reported it as 150k

4003~~~
Oh well, such a shame <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. My hope that he has one last great tournament in him is almost non-existent by now, I guess the World Cup final really was his swang song.

I wonder how long he'll stay at United if he can't stay fit. He has a 3 year contract, right? Not sure if he really wants to continue like this season for two more years. If your body doesn't allow you to play on the highest level anymore, it's usually better to stop.

4004~~~
Well not like he has played much for the NT in friendlies and qualifiers over the last couple of years anyways. He was vital to our WC win though.

4005~~~
I'm shocked we allowed him to travel for friendlies really.

4006~~~
Sir Alex talked Giggsy out of playing for Wales in friendlies and he was only young.

4007~~~
No issue with him travelling and getting some minutes with the national team. Can't just wrap him in cotton wool for another 2 weeks

4008~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4009~~~
Anyone got any photos of him looking supposedly overweight? I didn't notice it at all when he came on, but maybe my love for him is unconditional.

4010~~~
to be honest the first time I saw him at OT I was shocked how big he was. his shorts are like a skirt

4011~~~
I thought he looked big at the start of the season but he's not been that large the past few weeks has he?

4012~~~
He's not been seen much since Christmas to be fair.

4013~~~
I'm just going by the appearances he made in the Liverpool, West ham and man city games. Is he actually that fat?

4014~~~
Oh Basti <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4015~~~
Can't see or embed tweets at work but this made me laugh from Paddy Power:

'Mesut Ozil and Bastian Schweinsteiger both missed Germany training today. Ozil is carrying a knock while Schweinsteiger was at the bakery.' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4016~~~
To every idiot who calls him fat, here's some nice stats for you.
Just want to point out that people have different body types, and therefor some look a bit more tubby than others.

Bastian (or Bastien, that some of our fans like to call him, for some weird reason), has been our second fastest player this year, only beaten by Martial.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/say-bastian-schweinsteiger-manchester-uniteds-second-fastest-player/70922" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/sa...anchester-uniteds-second-fastest-player/70922</a>

4017~~~
He's been our 2nd fastest player in the PL this season? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Basti <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4018~~~
“Bastian Schweinsteiger has injured his medial collateral ligament, and is unavailable for both England and Italy,” he told reporters.

4019~~~
If it's a first degree sprain of the MCL he's out for a month.

If it's a second degree sprain he's out for 2 or more.

4020~~~
So more or less his season over?

4021~~~
Damm!<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4022~~~
Hopefully not. It depends on how his body reacts to treatments and being under the immediate supervision of medical professionals gives him a greater chance of a quicker recovery than the rest of us would have. He'd be having regular ice packs, hydrogen bath treatments and all that stuff.

4023~~~
So more Fellani,great.Can't have enough of that.

4024~~~
Season over. Just fecking great
My first thought.

4025~~~
The reporter in Munich tells that it is a partial rupture of his medial collateral ligament again (doctor diagnosis)



He had the same in January, or? Same knee, too.

The information before was from Löw from the press conference - without knowing what the doctor said (Bastian flew from Berlin to Munich to the Doc this morning)

4026~~~
Better hope Herrera is fit then, otherwise the prospect of Fellaini and Rooney back.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4027~~~
He should just call it a day at this point, its getting sad and its hurting his legacy. I said that it was a mistake when he joined United and it really shows. The guy who drove Bayerns midfield in arguably the most successfull time in the clubs history will now be remembered in England for being unfit and always injured. He should've stayed in Munich or just went straight for that American paycheck.

4028~~~
I actually agree in part, I don't think he needs to retire. He just needs to go to a less demanding league, China or the U.S would be perfect for him at this stage of his career. He's certainly not got a future at United beyond this season, in my opinion.

4029~~~
Out for rest of the season. What a disappointment he has been.

4030~~~
Massive disappointment yeah. I wasn't expecting him to change our team, but at least be fit and contribute more than he has done. Now he's out for the rest of the season I can't really see a bright future next season onwards for him here.

4031~~~

4032~~~
He's been such a dissapointment for us

4033~~~
We won't miss him. He's been a shite signing.

4034~~~
shit.

4035~~~
Looks like he is injured again with Germany.
I said so before his transfer, unfortunately Schweinsteiger is finished as a top player, due to his previous level, ability and experience he can still be very much useful, but not in a Prem and certainly not as a starter if we want to be a top club again, not a top-4 hopefuls.
When was the last time the guy was properly fit over the course of the whole season? Two years ago he had 23 league games, 20 last year, this season he is on 18, maybe he'll add a 3-4 more, but that's appearances, even with he subs it's not looking good.

Why he well have cloaked more than 34kph, the real problem is that he looks totally knackered after 25-30 minutes. He came on against City at 70', did a lot of running, but in added time you could see that his legs were gone already.
The other thing of course is that he is suited to play with any of our midfield. He can't be deployed as a deep lying DM, he has limited defensive skills, he can no longer be a box-to-box we need. His attacking skills are on the decline, Bastian used to score like 5-7 goals at lest, he now has only one, a corner one against Leicester. So no goals from "open play". No assists either and just 7 created chances or "key passes" as some stat sites call them. That's beyond dreadful.

I think it's better to retain Carrick, because he can be proper deep lying DM, he understands defensive side of things much better, he can even cover a CB. And then get a proper CB for LCB role and built our midfield with a focus on Ander and Blind. I don;t know if they would be good enough, but at least they the type of players you can built a dynamic midfield around. And Schweinsteiger is not anymore.

4036~~~
Not a huge surprise, having him and Carrick taking up 2 midfield squad positions next season is crazy IMO.

4037~~~
It'd be interesting to know how many weeks he's actually spent in Manchester.

I wouldn't sell in the summer but I also wouldn't let his presence shape who we do or don't sign. We need another midfielder, if Schweinsteiger is fit then it's a bonus.

4038~~~
Surely the end of his United career? he was definitely worth the punt, but unfortunately it didn't pay off. Bayern aren't idiots, if he was naywhere near his best they wouldn't have sold him.

4039~~~
Is he out for the rest of the season?

4040~~~
Very likely. Press saying he could be out of Euros as well.

4041~~~
Why would it be the end?

4042~~~
According to whoscored he got 1660 mins played in all competetions this season. That's 18 full games. Sad.

4043~~~
31/32. Injury prone.

4044~~~
His fitness problems were the main reason why I didn't think it was a good signing in the summer. 

I remember being amazed that there were posters who refused to concede this point.

4045~~~
Even if Herrera is fit, Fellaini will start. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4046~~~
Ah feck off. I personally have enjoyed watching him whenever he's played and he's brought a lot to the table, and I could only see his influence increasing. Against West Ham he came on and really made the difference. Such a shame he's so injury prone. At his age, given the work he has always put in, it could be very hard to reach a good level. Hopefully he does though, and makes a big difference next season.

4047~~~
He can just stay at Munich now. Really praying Mourinho shows real balls and bins him and Rooney.

4048~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4049~~~
Mourinho dropped Terry, and even Ronaldo for a game as punishment, which I find impressive in this regard.

4050~~~
Something similar with Casillas too, no? I don't know though, Rooney is a whole different ballgame. We all expected van Gaal with his physical balls to do something and all he did was make him undroppable when fit.

4051~~~
Thought he has been mostly good when he played. Don't understand the criticism he endures here. Would have him at half form over useless Fellaini any day.

4052~~~
I feel sorry for him that he might miss the Euros.

Not really a setback for us tbh.

4053~~~
Sorry but I see it the other way round. I cannot understand why Fellaini gets criticised every time and Schweinsteiger is defended by some.
Fellaini will never reach Schweinsteiger`s class when he was in his prime but he clearly has done more for us so far.

4054~~~
Probably going to mark the beginning of the end for him at United and elsewhere. At 31 these injuries will be harder and harder to bounce back from, especially knee injuries.

4055~~~
you get what you bought: an old man beyond his best years, which was was obvious for people who watch the bundesliga. he get himself pulled out the rest of his body in the wc but that was it. 
i can hear the laughing in munich from here. while united was glad to buying schweinsteiger, bayern bought the young kimmich, which was an excelent transfer.
yeah schweinsteiger was cheap in the first place, but was costs his anuity contract per year?
woodward seems to be a genius...

4056~~~
I beg to differ. Watching Fellaini in a United kit makes me incredibly sad. Its a conversation for another thread, but Schweinsteiger has shown leadership and the ability to pass more than 5 yards.

4057~~~

4058~~~
Van Gaal said he had to convince the board to sanction this transfer as they had doubts. Woodward simply backed his manager but it hasn't worked out so far which is a shame.

4059~~~
Agree with this he had a run of games where he looked good, injuries ruined his season. If Carrick is going he should be kept around for his experience.

4060~~~
Sometimes I wonder if Rooney has something written in his contract or an understanding with the owners/directors because I've never seen a player play as badly as he has and still be given such a special status.

4061~~~
Bastian Hargreaves

4062~~~
I think you should buy Benatia next <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He will really help your defense!

4063~~~
What about Javi Martinez?

4064~~~
I still hope he will overcome his injury issues. The problem with Benatia is, he's even shit the few times he's fit <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> But as far as I understand it, you have a soft spot for our crocks. 25 million, deal? He will surely play 10-15 games per season <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4065~~~
I think it is more ridiculous that he got called up when he is nowhere good enough nor fit enough. Sometimes manager need to make the tough choice of leaving of finished players.

4066~~~
We went for Benatia in 2014 but thankfully you beat us to him.

4067~~~
Such a blow in my opinion,a player that offers real leadership in a team lacking in them.We could have done with Bastian at this pivotal time in the season. I hate saying it because I like Schweinsteiger but it feels we are getting the tail end of his career.One filled with injuries and decline. This knee injury is a right curse with him,you know it's bad when it follows from one club to us. 
I hope next year he's used more strategic and recovery isn't rushed this time.

4068~~~
Tbf, you are talking about a manager who still continues to pick Podolski.

4069~~~
shame for him, we will get over it with ease. Now we really should be looking forward to replace Carrick/Sweiny

4070~~~
getting to that point where he will be looking himself in the mirror. As dismissive people are writing him off with this news, ive witnessed the difference many times this year when he is on the pitch and not

4071~~~
Yeah, you cannot expect too much sense from him.

4072~~~
If Ballack hadn't injured his ankle before the WC 2010 Löw might still be picking him today

4073~~~
Out for the season according to LVG. What a hugely disappointing first season. When he's not been injured, he's been overweight and huffing and puffing, barely managing 60 minutes. Was hoping for much more from our World Cup winner.

Hope for a drastic improvement next season, but I won't hold my breath.

4074~~~
Needs to quit international football.

4075~~~
I'd hope that we'd have made signings that mean he's dropped down the pecking order quite a bit next season.

4076~~~
Sporting a knee brace out in Madrid.

Almost forgot we had him.

Disappointing signing all things considered.

4091~~~
I don't know how he's being slagged off this much in this thread.  Fair enough he looks injury prone, and if he can't get fit he'd have to go for that reason.  But if he can stay fit, he's shown enough glimpses of what he can do for me.  His experience could be important with all the youngsters about the place.

4092~~~
Wonder if he pulled her hair during sex masochism. He has, after all, firmly bought into the process.

4093~~~
Spotted in Rome.

4094~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4096~~~
I wonder if he has played his last match for United. If LVG is in charge next season, I imagine captain Rooney will be playing in midfield, leaving less room for Schweinsteiger. If Mourinho arrives, he might want more energy in midfield. Either way, Schweinsteiger doesn't look like a regular starter for us next season unless Rooney and Carrick both depart. Would he be happy to be a squad player ?

4097~~~
Selected in the provisional Germany squad.

4098~~~
Still in doubt if he makes the tournament though. If he's fit enough to train, Löw will bring him along and similarly to the World Cup slowly fit him into the team. Maybe a game as a sub in the group stages and then a start in the first or second knockout round depending on the opponent with the hope that he can give us 1 or 2 excellent performances in the semifinal/final if we make it so far.

4099~~~
Dread to think the size of him next time he puts on a kit

4100~~~
He'd be a huge boost just having around I'd have from a captaincy point of view. Excellent leader is Schweinsteiger.

4101~~~
That's a marked improvement on the last time we saw him.

4102~~~
Cannot believe he is going to the Euros.

- If he plays -

So exciting to see him in a squad that might be able to play exciting football again

4103~~~
Able to run? have to see that to believe it.

4104~~~
Named in German squad for the Euros

4105~~~
Now, what are your thoughts on him next season at United? I'd love it (Keegan style) if he nailed down a place in the first XI as I think he's a brilliant player. He just need to get fit. And by fit I don't mean just "not injured", I mean really FIT, like he used to be, not huffing around sweating like a pig like this season.

How hard can that be, really? Losing pace is one thing, it happens, maintaining stamina though should not be a problem.

4106~~~
I absolutely love Schweinsteiger. One of the best midfielders of his generation. 

But it's looking more and more likely that Bayern sold us a crock.

4107~~~
Really bad news for us if he's going to the Euros.

Needed to get fit.

4108~~~
Sell him.

Fat and pointless.

4109~~~
If he's able to rain and be a presence in the dressing room, then he is certainly worth keeping.

Imagine being a young lad and sitting in the same dressing room as Schweinsteiger and Rooney. For those who don't get completely intimidated, it would make you feel the need to raise your game and step up.

He's also a natural leader. Something we are desperately missing.

4110~~~
31 appearances though and his injury was something that could have been avoided. We've seen Memphis struggle with the pace, so hopefully he comes back alright and if he looks after himself he could have a few more years in him. He just needs to get up to speed and intensity and not be reckless with challenges. Leave that side of things to others.

4111~~~
I didn't realise he had that many appearance. It must have been his near non-existent 2nd half of the season which has clouded my memory. Would love for him to stay fit next season. He can still contribute.

4112~~~
If he can do what Shaw did and get fit over the summer, I'd keep him. He looked pretty good for us when he played, he controlled and lead the midfield well which is more than I can say about Schneiderlin.

I mean he's 'only' 31. I'd say he's got a good 2 or 3 years left in him.

4113~~~
Most players would look like that in midfield under LVG.

4114~~~
Yeah, but Schweinsteiger looks like that in any midfield under any manager. I don't think Carrick is particularly great any more but binning him before Schweinsteiger makes little sense to me.

4115~~~
Bah. The natural leader bollocks. I didn't see any of his mythical leadership this season despite people going on and on about it. He strolls around the pitch doing sweet feck all. Waste of time and money.

Get rid of him and sign a proper CM who can run without panting.

4116~~~

4117~~~
That photo doesn't do Rooney's barnet any favours.

4118~~~
He's like a fan today, posing with all the players <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4119~~~
Did he play in the FA Cup?

4120~~~
Forgot we had him. Hopefully Mourinho bins him.

4121~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No, he will be a key player alongside Schneiderlin in midfield. Watch this space

4122~~~
God I hope not. One of the great things Mourinho tends to do is have a team of athletes. I hope he isn't after Fat Basti's finger pointing.

4123~~~
First round against Sheffield United and the home match against WH.

4124~~~
Jesus. That's a nightmare of a a midfield.

Hopefully Jose bins the pair of them and signs some proper CM's.

4125~~~
Oh yeah. Good and thanks!

4126~~~
Schweinsteiger is a technically gifted player and a very clever footballer.

People here have forgotten how good he is, I believe the same is true for Schneiderlin. This mess of a season isn't a fair metric to judge them on, I feel.

Mourinho will get the best out of him and schneiderlin next season.

4127~~~
Not sure about Schneiderlin but Schweinsteiger is still a class player and Mourinho is a fan of him. If he suffers less injuries next season then he will still have an important role to play for us.

4128~~~
I could see Carrick getting a 1 year extension to allow for transition then swapping with Basti a lot to control play when needed.

4129~~~
Daniel Taylor's latest, had this interesting bit: "Schweinsteiger has spent large parts of the season injured and his tendency to return to Germany, flying in and out for United’s matches, has gone down badly, to say the least."

Never heard about that, but not good if it's true.

4130~~~
I think it's more misery for him next year. Not sure what type of football we will play next year, but i doubt Mourinho would want him. And this "special treatment", Germany visits thing does not surprise me a bit.
The main thing is he is so far gone, he simply can't play the combative, box-to-box CM we need. And as a DM he can still work on international level with Germany, maybe. But i PL he is just to weak.

4131~~~
I really don't get the problem. He's injured. He probably has specialists he likes to use in Germany. At least he's coming in for our games. I bet Luke Shaw spent a lot of time with his family and friends when he couldn't train, the only difference is that it was in England.

4132~~~
It's Müller-Wohlfahrt.

4133~~~
If he can stay fit Mourinho will use him a lot.

I'd expect a 4-3-3 with Bastian, Rooney and Schneiderlin being the 3 for majority of games, excluding any new signings we will probably make.

4134~~~
That would be an absolute disaster.

4135~~~
We should sell him if we can. Nobody will take his massive wages on though.

4136~~~
MLS?

4137~~~
He's been good when he's played, see how Jose takes to him in pre season.

4138~~~
Name 3-4 matches when he played really good?
The only game i can name is Swansea home, i can't remember any other game when he was above average. He scored an important goal against Watford for example, but his general play in that match was piss-poor.
I think even Fellaini had a much better season than Bastian did.

4139~~~
Would be interesting to see him play for a better manager. Can't be playing 2 deep holding mids again though. That was awful scenes, however "solid" it made us

4140~~~
The only concerns are Schweinsteiger's fitness. (Seems like he will be fit for the Euros and starts team training this week) 

There is no doubt that Mou wants that fit Schweinsteiger - he openly courted him since 2010, had e.g an hour long private talk with him in the German team hotel in Russia during the Euros 2012, told him that he is his after the CL 2010 and praised him in all of his comments during the World Cup 2014.

4141~~~
He had the whole year to get fit and he did not and you say that he will miraculously be fit next one. That's just dreaming. Maybe he will even have a good Euro, but what then he will go on holiday and come August fit he will be no more.
That was 6 years ago, Bastian is not even a half of the player he was back then. Last season proved it beyond any reasonable doubt. And Mourinho wanted him in Spain. That makes sense because in Spain the game is way slower, more technical and tactical, in PL you need to be fit, i mean "fit" in every sense of the world, like has stamina and so on. In most of our games Schweini lasted no more than 50-60 minutes. And not only in August, this was going on well into the season.

4142~~~
Can't believe he's been included in Germany's squad for the Euros having not played for us for months - is this what he's been saving himself for?

No doubt he'll get injured again

4143~~~
Is he even fit?

Hopefully he has a good tournament if he is, I'd like him to impress because I believe he has something to offer us still.

4144~~~
No, he's not, they just value good players more than we do.

4145~~~
It's a bit weird that Löw chose to drop Reus from national team while keeping Schweini citing permanent injury problems, when from what I gather Dortmund's winger hasn't been injured since January. After checking out their final squad for tournament I guess it all points towards 3-5-2 tactics that Germans will deploy in France.

4146~~~
Khedira said something of the sort "He can barely run straight at the moment" about Reus

4147~~~
Or don't mind their players being overweight.

4148~~~
Transfermarkt says it's adductor problems. In past he needed from 3 to 16 days to recover from them, but it looks like this time it's more serious. But I will repeat 3-5-2 is not a system that rewards wingers and that may have played a part in Löw's reasoning.

4149~~~
Not convinced by that. Everytime Löw used the 3-5-2, he played Rudy as the right wingback and he sent him home as well. I don't think we have any player in the squad who really fits the right wingback position now. We still have many wingers in the team and Reus would have been a great choice to play as one of the two forwards in a 3-5-2 as well. Reus went home because he's struggling with his injury and the medical staff didn't believe he'd be fit enough to have a positive impact in the tournament. Don't think there's more to it than that.

We still have Draxler, Schürrle, Sane in the squad as wingers and Özil, Götze and Müller also played often wide in the World Cup. I think that he sent Rudy home (thank god for that) is a bigger sign against the 3-5-2 than that Reus missed out again.

4150~~~
Your arguments seem on the money, but aren't Schürrle and Sane the only proper wingers in that squad(Bellarabi and Brandt got shot alongside Reus). Also who's going to play as fullbacks? I can only see a pot consisting of Can, Hoewedes and Hector. That's quite a small group going into tournament when at the same time there's big pack of defenders that primarily play as centre halves.

4151~~~
Apart from Reus injury, You have to factor in the fact that Schweiny will be very vocal and a leader in the dressing room, Something that cannot be understated.

4152~~~
Hector/Höwedes leftback and Can/Kimmich rightback. The fullback position is a problem for us already, but it's even worse once we move to a 3-5-2, where the wingbacks have even more responsibility than in a 433 or 4231. None of our wingers is good enough defensively to move back to a wingback position and none of our fullback options offers enough going forward to rely on him alone on the wing.

Not sure what this has to do with Schweinsteiger by the way? Maybe we should move that discussion to the Germany thread in the Euro forum.

4153~~~
They don't care about as long as he plays well.

4154~~~
One discussed topic led to another and Schweinsteiger got left miles behind in the loo at a gas station... I'll proceed to the euro thread.

4155~~~
I can imagine Jose be keeping a close eye on Schweinsteiger in the Euro's, providing he plays. 

He's still got the ability to control a game, and with the right partner beside him, I wouldn't mind seeing Schweinstieger in the same role as Fabregas.

4156~~~
He has not been saving himself - he was injured.

He is in team training since today again. They told that he is further with his training etc. than he was in the World Cup.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjzBBrPXIAEc3pA.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjzBBrPXIAEc3pA.jpg"/>

4157~~~
Can't wait to see him next season under a proper manager.

4158~~~
How the feck can someone call that overweight?

4159~~~
If that's overweight, I want to be overweight.

4160~~~
You've got a weird definition of overweight.

4161~~~
Reminds me when people kept calling Shaw overweight.

4162~~~
always wondered myself <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> i guess everyone has to look like di maria or something. Its also a common misconception that low body fat is synonymous with fitness. Its quite far from the truth. You can be "overweight" and also be very fit and vice versa

4163~~~
I'd be very surprised if Mourinho didn't use him.

4164~~~
Mourinho is Schweinsteiger fan since 2010. After the CL final he told to Schweinsteiger openly that he is going to get him... But Schweinsteiger then made a new contract with Bayern.

During the Euros 2012 Mourinho was coming to the hotel in Lwiw and was talking with him for an hour.

And he was full of praise for him during the World Cup.

4165~~~
Lets see how he runs first. This season he was the slowest in the team.
Would not be a surprise if he would be a failure at Euros and even manages to get injured again. And misses our tour, pre-season. Even if he will be in Germany team and will do well, when PL season starts i think he will go back to that sorry state he has been this whole season and people will blame whatever, something like "look the guy had a great Euro, he just needs time to recover and get fit again, blah-blah, blah". I hope he can rediscover his WC2014 form, but I'm afraid Munich let him go exactly because they saw he can't really be a force anymore.

4166~~~
He was great last year when he was fit, and played a decent amount of games.
Can't wait to see him at the Euros and how he plays under Jose.

4167~~~
By a footballers standard. Guy could barely run.

4168~~~
Yeah, remember that well. Ando has fecked with people's minds forever it seems. 
Aye. Anything but lean = overweight it seems.

4169~~~
He isn't.

4170~~~
He looked heavier last time he played for us, but mainly the issue is he's immobile and that is a killer in the PL, especially if the equally immobile Carrick is sticking around.

4171~~~
Pre-injury he wasn't. He popped up all over the place. It's only after injuries that he was static.

4172~~~
I don't know how anyone could look at him a couple of years ago and now and claim he's in peak condition. Semantics about what constitutes being overweight aside he's nowhere near fit enough.

4173~~~
It's not good but it's not the main issue. That is his constantly passing backward or square. I'll swear our forwards stopped moving in front of him after running into space, only to see him look at them, quite clearly see them, yet turn around and pass backwards. 

There's a lot our fans watch him play and in their mind's eye see the man as he was over two years ago. That happens to all of us at times I suppose, but it's the only explanation for people thinking he actually played well last season as far as I can see.

4174~~~
Some strange assessments in here I think.

4175~~~
I bet you one of those fans who didn't understand the humour in calling Lampard fat weren't you.

4176~~~
If any player without his big name put in his performances they would have been shit on but since it was Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger he could plod around the field and people thought it was amazing.

4177~~~
It wasn't ground coverage but mobility on the ball that I felt was the issue, the fast press of the PL was too much for him in many games.

I do think a lot or enamored with the player he was rather than the player he is, even LvG himself seemed confused as to why he wasn't the same player he managed at Bayern.

4178~~~
Come on, Bastian has pedigree like no other midfielder in our team. Of course he will figure in Mourinho plans

4179~~~
Definitely. He's immensely experienced and will be central to Mourinho's starting XI imo.

4180~~~
Never mind the form, watch the pedigree.

4181~~~
Does that question even make sense to you?

4182~~~
Let me simplify it.

You called Schweinsteiger fat.
He's not.
Did you laugh when people called Lampard fat?
Because he wasn't either.

got it?

4183~~~
There are question marks over Schweini, but his pedigree will guarantee him chances and probably a solid place in plans for incoming season. Then gametime will verify everything. Are you really indicating that we should get rid of him after one season, while keeping in team Fellaini, Herrera and Carrick? You cannot just nuke midfield area and start building it from scratch in one transfer window.

4184~~~
It doesn't require simplification thanks. Just to make sense.

I said he was overweight. If you'd like further clarification that's in comparison to how a footballer should be. Watch the man play. He's blowing out his arse after ten minutes. People have their head in the sand if they think he's anywhere near fit enough. Got it?

4185~~~
He's nowhere near good enough, I'd be gutted if he's a starter for us. Apart from being a classy person, and this leader stuff, he has no use.

4186~~~
He did not play one game in United's shirt when he actually run. Like a proper, fit player that is. Wolfsburg away was before any "injuries" and he was by far the slowest player on the field.

4187~~~
When we signed him, I said people were expecting too much and that he'd have injury problems at some point. I ate some crow for some of his games, but in the end I was right.

4188~~~
That Watford game he almost single-handedly turned a draw into a win through shear force of will and leadership.  

We haven't seen that since Keane.

4189~~~
It's a myth. When has Carrick run throughout his United career? When does Schneiderlin or Herrera properly run? They're not wide players that have to flat out sprint, especially in LVGs system. But pre-injury, Schweinsteiger gave us as much energy as anyone in midfield. He would chase, harry and tackle in a number of positions, which takes mobility.

4190~~~
I hope not, building midfield on a 32 year old has-been who is injury prone would be dumb, especially if Rooney is also going to be lumbering about in there.

4191~~~
We wouldn't be building anything - its already there. He just needs to stay healthy and get in the Mourinho frame of mind. Jose has worked with the likes of Zanetti, Materazzi, Lucio, Samuel, Milito, and Stankovic - all over 30 - in the same year, so I doubt Schweinsteiger and Zlatan would be in a different category, especially with talk of a Carrick extension.

4192~~~
All of those players have the same thing in common, they played for him in the OAP league, not the fastest and most physically demanding league in Europe, and on top of that only one of them is a CM, and last but not least none of them were the injury prone crock that Schweinsteiger is. We need athletes in midfield and players with energy and ground coverage, not old players whose best is behind them.

4193~~~
I don't think he cares about age as long as they can perform to the standard he wants them to. Since you brought up the English league, he didn't have any compunction working with Terry, Lampard, Cashley, and an ageing Eto'o (as well as a 43 year old Mark Schwarzer) when he rejoined Chelsea. Bottom line, age is irrelevant as long as the manager feels the player in question can perform the required job.

4194~~~
The odds of him staying fit are pretty low looking at his injury record over the last few years. He is another Falcao and I hope we move him along. We already have Carrick and Rooney, who I am pretty certain will play as a part of the midfield three, as the older heads to provide 'experience'. Gesticulating at others anyway was never a sign of leadership.

He already enjoyed a one year paid holiday at our expense. We don't need to give him another.

4195~~~
Look at the core of the team that he actually won the league under with at at Chelsea this time, he'd broomed the aging has-beens and the core was Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa, because he realized you can't win leagues relying on has-beens, which is what Schweinsteiger is.

4196~~~
Why does it have to be a case of building on/around him? At a top club, you have to be a Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar etc to have the team built around you. For others, you play a role just like others.

4197~~~
The post I responded to said he thought he'd be a central part of Jose's starting 11, if you are a regular starter then you are building that area of the team, in this case the engine room, on that player.

4198~~~
You're missing the broader point - which is Mourinho doesn't seem to have an issue with age as long as the player in question can get the job done. He proved this in multiple leagues with multiple league winning sides. Thankfully Fergie didn't have any problems either otherwise the likes of Neville, Keane, Scholes, Giggs, Blanc, Ferdinand and others would've been sold off well before they should have. Schweinsteiger, being younger, is no different.

4199~~~
He relied a ton on Drogba and Terry, which you conveniently ignore. Schweinsteiger might not be a staple in the first X1 but he'll be relied on to be a solid squad player, which is what he should be unless he regains peak fitness and form.

4200~~~
I'm not missing the point, the point is he's past it and massively injury prone and playing in a much tougher league than his body is used to. You also said he'd be a starter, at best he should be used like Fergie used latter day Scholes, as a sub that can come on in games as an extra body in midfield to keep possession.

4201~~~
Yes, if he stays fit and performs, he would be. If he doesn't, he won't. For BFS at this stage of his career, that's all he can expect as we have the likes of Herrera, schneiderlin and Carrick all in contention for those spots with reports indicating we will buy atleast 1 more CM. Which is why I said he could be a important part of the 11 without necessarily having it built around him.

4202~~~
He didn't rely on Drogba who made most of his appearances off the bench, again Raoul said a key starter, not a bit part player. As for Terry, CB's last longer because there is less mobility and stamina required, especially in a Mourinho team that uses a deep defensive line.

4203~~~
Well yes you are missing it because you're not addressing the examples I've provided where Jose has repeatedly used players in their 30s, including Drogba which <a class="username" data-user="85284, @Wednesday at Stoke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85284/">@Wednesday at Stoke</a> noted. Clearly Mourinho doesn't care about age which is why Schweinsteiger will likely be an important part of his side.

4204~~~
Just look at that set of options and the problem in hording has-beens is apparent, especially when Herrera isn't a proper CM and Schneiderlin has looked like a deer in the headlights at United.

4205~~~
Drogba was a bit part player in that side, he was hardly a major part of the title win, so I didn't ignore it, you are again saying a main part of our 11, you are also repeatedly ignoring that I have pointed out over and over that he's a crock which John Terry, the only valid example given, isn't.

4206~~~
Drogba is one of about half a dozen examples in multiple league. Clearly there is a proven pattern that he doesn't see things as you do.

4207~~~
Should we have sold Ferdinand, Giggs, and Carrick in 2011 then ? Fergie obviously didn't think so.

4208~~~
All of the examples you gave were from the same league, a league synonymous with has-beens, his Real Madrid side, his first Chelsea side and his title winning 2nd Chelsea side weren't, so the pattern is he used old players in a league littered with them and had an old striker playing a few minutes here and there when he won the PL in his second stint as Chelsea boss. None of that is the same as you saying a 32 year old crock who is past his best will be a mainstay in the most demanding league around.

4209~~~
CB's are different, Carrick has also been in this league his whole career and has hardly had any injuries until the last 2 seasons. Yes I think we kept Giggs and Scholes around too long at the expense of buying in prime CM's, which cost us against Barca in the CL final both times.

4210~~~
No they were from the Prem and the Italian league, which you attempted to casually brush off as irrelevant because they are less physical than than England.

4211~~~
That's a fact, they are less demanding by a long way. So a bit part Drogba and a hardly ever injured John Terry playing in a totally different position are the English examples, again it's not the same as an injury prone and injury ravaged CM being a regular starter.

4212~~~
Herrera is a CM and most of our players gave been shit under LVG because of the restrictive system, won't hold that against Schneiderlin.

4213~~~
So let me get this straight - Italians can play much longer than English league players because the Italian league is slowwww ?

4214~~~
Herrera isn't a CM, he's an AM in a midfield 3, pretty much Oscar's role at Chelsea. Being shit is one thing, being a completely invisible ball dodger in midfield is another, Schneiderlin plays in the position where you see most of the ball in a possession team and offered nothing.

4215~~~
Good point, which is often overlooked. When the manager is disconnected from the squad, the players will almost always collectively perform poorly and vice versa when a manager like Mourinho galvanizes the squad to punch well above their collective weight. Most of our players should simply not be evaluated based on LvG's tenure - especially Schmidfield and Memphis. I think each of them as well as Darmian, Varela, the kids, et all will improve significantly next year simply as a result of having a cohesive manager who instills an ethos of belief in the players.

4216~~~
Yes, if your body isn't having as much taken out of it week after week it sustains better, and it's not just the lack of speed and tempo, it's the wear and tear of the physicality in the PL. It's not a coincidence that you have players like Totti still going at nearly 40 just like Maldini and Zanetti did, or that AC Milan had a team full of mid 30's players not that long ago.

4217~~~
I think that's pipe dream stuff, expecting every mediocre player to suddenly be good under Jose is not realistic, LvG was a crap manager but some of these lot need to take responsibility for their own shortcomings.

4218~~~
Well you just had Giggs going until he was 40 as well so that's not much of a contrast. In each case you cited those players stuck around because they were mainstays at their respective clubs who held onto them longer for sentimental reasons as opposed to slothlike tempo of the Italian league.

4219~~~
His Inter Milan team were even older with the likes of Milito, Stankovic, Eto, Lucio, Samuel, materazzi and zanetti all in either the same age group as Bastian right now or older.

Theres a reason that team sunk as soon as Jose left, other than his second go around with Chelsea, he had always favored quite a few older players in his squads.

4220~~~
Suddenly becoming good is completely subjective - we can however assume the squad as a whole will perform more cohesively than under LvG - both by way of squad solidarity and goals scored and conceded. If anything, Ranieri's Leicester have proven that fairly inconspicuous players with minimal experience can win the league with a good manager who can coach and inspire the players to believe in themselves and play as a collective team.

4221~~~
Milan aren't the only team in Italy with a lot of old players, just the most prominent, and we did the same and are doing it again with Carrick, Giggs was a freak of nature in those latter years, while he had niggling muscle injuries as a younger player like a lot of speed merchants, he was in great physical condition through his 30's, the complete opposite of Schweinsteiger and a rarity for most players in the PL, especially at top clubs when it comes to CM.

4222~~~
Milito was pivotal during their treble run as well. Fortunately, the slow motion aspect of the Italian league allowed a 30 year old to knock in two goals in the CL final.

4223~~~
Jose's Real Madrid and both Chelsea sides all had younger players at the core, he inherited an old side in Italy as most of their teams were old back then and it wasn't until Juve got back on track that we started to see a shift to more dynamic sides in Italy, with Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli following suit and the Milan's in a period of transition. 

Leicester are like Pep in the Giggs debate IMO, exceptions to the rule rather than the rule, last season was as bizarre as you will ever see and Leicester unearthed 2 gems that helped them to win that title, it was unusual to say the least. I thought our team spirit under LvG looked ok out on the pitch, but I'd agree that a player like Herrera struggled under his demands as he's a risk taker, but the likes of Schneiderlin and Memphis only have themselves to blame for how bad they were in my view, lacking the mental requirements to step up at United, they were shown up by players like Lingard and even Fellaini who showed the fight and desire required, even if their level of talent seems lesser.

4224~~~
30 not 32, one off CL game vs a 38 game PL season, a striker not a CM so not in the the thick of the combative aspects, and also not a crock.

4225~~~

4226~~~
Beast calves.

4227~~~
Those fatty legs are a disgrace, I hope Jose cuts his rations.

4228~~~
He looks a lot thinner there than he has done all season for us.

4229~~~
Bet he has a fantastic tournament. Always seems to do well in big occasions.

4230~~~
Basti always has been a big man for the big occasion. I hope he doesn't leave it all out there in France and come back to England crocked. A fit Schweinsteiger could be like a new signing.

4231~~~
Last season was a write off. Looks very lean in that photo.

4232~~~
Reminds me a bit about the 2010 World Cup, when Klose after a really underwhelming season under van Gaal was unfit and overweight before the tournament. He even said it himself. There was a huge discussion in Germany that he shouldn't go to the tournament at all because his performances were awful and he looked out of shape. Löw got him into a top physical shape within 4 weeks. Klose looked lean and healthy and ran himself into the ground for Germany, had no fitness problems at all.

Not trying to blame van Gaal here by the way, it's of course down to Schweinsteiger. He's responsible to work on his fitness/eat healthy and it raises questions about his attitude last season. But I wrote before that I found it odd how he was allowed to travel to Rome and Dubai to watch his girlfriend play tennis during the season just because he was injured. He should have stayed in Manchester and worked individually in United's trainings facilities to get ready for his comeback in my opinion. The two cases are just oddly similar and I hope we get to see another great tournament from Schweinsteiger. He's so important to our balance in midfield.

4233~~~
Think he will have an excellent season under Mourinho

4234~~~
I have that feeling too. I think Mou will know how to utilize him, both tactically and physically, knowing when to rest him and use him. Could be huge for us.

4235~~~
I thought when he played he added a lot to us, his passing was good and he gave us a sense of composure. Obviously he's not got the legs of a 26 year old anymore but under Mourinho expect to see a lot of BFS. I can't fecking wait.

4236~~~
Hopefully he does well and get some confidence back. Mourinho was always a huge fan, and I thought he was actually decent when fit for the most part last season. Main problem was LvG's tactics which he listened to, even though they didn't work. But I don't think he's completely past it and can still have a huge impact next season I think. Just needs his games to be managed instead of being overplayed like LvG did with him.

4237~~~
His calves have calves

4238~~~
What a crock. Hope Mourinho releases him and buys some midfielder none of us have heard of.

4239~~~
Or buys a really good in his prime one we have heard of......

4240~~~
Ha. Knew you'd bite on that. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4241~~~
It would have been rude not to after you set the table. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4242~~~
That's true.

4243~~~
Even on his bad games, he'd be quiet, shuffling about, and next thing he'd close down a mid on the ball, make an interception and ping a first time 30 yard lobbed through ball to leave Rooney 1 on 1 with their keeper(or something else awesome).

Then of course Rooney would feck it up, but I guess you can't have everything...

4244~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4245~~~
Schweini's sheer presence on the pitch is worth keeping him around for.

We've got a lot of kids in the team, and players who don't have much aggression, Schweini is well worth keeping around on this basis.

Disappointing to hear all these stories about him travelling instead of training but it sounds like LVG let it happen.
Whenever I saw photos of him looking somewhat chunky towards the end of last season I always thought his calves, with his socks pulled up, looked like those of an obese old woman. Turns out they're more like WWE calves. He looks like he's on fecking 'roids!

4246~~~
Despite a lot of the stuff that gets written now, when he did play definitely made us more solid.
So there's every chance Mourinho can get something out of him.

Just not sure how it'll work with Rooney, Carrick and Schneiderlin also around, unless we get a ferocious paced right winger in

4247~~~
That Arsenal away game was the oddest use of him.
Pressing high up the pitch!

4248~~~
A team with Bastian and Zlatan will not lose under any circumstance. I can't wait for next season!

4249~~~
He was injured when he travelled, he never travelled when he was training.

4250~~~
This is the problem, we have 3 players who want to play in midfield but are lacking the stamina and mobility for it, if we only had one and partnered them with 2 energetic #8's then sure, but at least 2 of them will be wanting to start every game which makes the midfield composition difficult.

4251~~~
Will be player of the season for us, heard it here first.

4252~~~
And last, I'll wager.

4253~~~
I already called it <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4254~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4255~~~
You said he will have an excellent season, i said he will be player of the year <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Wow, you Schweini hater. Wait and see, i expect an apology from you at the end of the season.

4256~~~
Look forward to seeing him next season, bit of a non factor this season, you could see his class but I don't think he offered a lot. Need winners in the team and he certainly is one, he is an absolute icon of german football, if we have him, Rooney and Zlatan that's about 3 of the biggest names of the last 10 ywars.

4257~~~
Huge disappointment and I believe we've been screwed over once again by Bayern. I was watching Toni Kroos in the CL final and when you saw his fitness you really understand why we're not playing CL football any longer. Total disgrace by our medical team to let a guy who's not even fit to play D.6 football join.

4258~~~
Haha <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4259~~~
Wait, what's the connection between Toni Kroos and our league position?

4260~~~
Anyone watch the friendly vs Hungary today? How did he do?

4261~~~
Came on for the last 30 mins, game was already a dead rubber by then. Nothing really happened anymore, he fit right in and just played his part without any wow factor. Pointed a bit, definitely got some touches, tried to do what Kroos did before, but it was just a run of the mill game. Didn't look out of place for sure, he's the captain after all.

4262~~~
the game was pretty much over but looked decent IMO
Gave the ball cheaply 2 times but also had few nice touches/passes. Defensively was solid, won few and his positioning was spot on.

4263~~~
Thanks. Hopefully someone uploads his match compilation to youtube.

4264~~~
The pointing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4265~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> If he wasn't such a great player, the pointing would be ridiculous.

4266~~~
Belting story. The title of the story tells us he's off. The first line of the story repeats that line. The second line tells us he's in the German squad. And that's it. Apart from a dozen or more paragraphs about Carvalho and Mourinho they've inexplicably thrown in there.

4267~~~
Was just about to post the same. Headline says he's off then that is all. Pretty sure he's going to be here next season.

4268~~~
Can't believe Mourinho would sell someone with his experience

4269~~~
Only the Mirror, nothing to see here.

4270~~~
So thats Blind, Mata, Memphis and Schweinsteiger that the media already think they are on the way out <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> anyone else i forgot? Ridiculous

4271~~~
Couldn't say I would mind if he left. 

A true great of the game but since he's been here, when he's fit he's still fat...

4272~~~
Hope he sticks around, him and Zlatan are good characters to have in the dressing room.

4273~~~
Looking forward to him working with Jose. His best is probably behind him but he's still one of the best midfielders in the game. Hopefully he can stay fit and flourish one last time.

4274~~~
Agree our best midfielder by a mile when semi fit. Hope he sheds a bit weight and has one last go of it. Up there with Scholes imo.

4275~~~
I can see us selling him, especially if Carrick is given a new deal as rumoured.

4276~~~
I'd rather keep Schweinsteiger for another year than Carrick. I think we'll sell him though.

4277~~~
Bastian would still be very useful in Europa League play but I seriously doubt he has the engine any longer to cope with top half clubs in the BPL.

4278~~~
Herrera too. If Zlatan will be on £200k/week and and Bastian is currently on £200k/week, the easiest way for an accountant to balance the books is to axe Bastian.

4279~~~
Schweinsteiger isn't on £200k a week.

4280~~~
Fitness

4281~~~
Why do we need to balance anything? We have a surplus after clearing Di Maria, Falcao, RvP (250k pw reported each) and never replaced them with marquee transfers.

4282~~~
No other club would offer him that salary on a new contract. We would have to let him go free and pay half his salary for a new club. 
Might be worth it from a playing point of view depending on your opinion, but it wouldn't be the financial saving you imagine.
A contract is a contract.

4283~~~
Schweini will be the first name on the team sheet under Mourinho

4284~~~
i hope you are right!

4285~~~
£136k a week then.

4286~~~
Morgan and Ander both are much more faster and mobile than Bastian is. It's even ridiculous to compare. As for Carrick, yes, he never was a agile player, but he always played much-much deeper than Schweinsteiger. All this Schweinsteiger will play a DM is just silly nonsense, he simply can't. While Carrick can actually play a DM, he is way better in terms of any defensive action and even was used by Fergie (if we don't trust Moyes and LVG) as a makeshift CB. A sort of testament to his defensive abilities.

Schweinsteiger that does not support the attack that does not score 5-10 goals a season and creates as much is a dead-weight. Which is what he was this season.

4287~~~
He's worth keeping. When you have someone like Carrick still here - maybe signing a new contract then why would we give up on him after a season? It's not impossible to imagine him being better next season. It'll be perhaps a more positive environment and his experience and know how might be more apparent. If we have a dressing room that includes Bastian and Zlatan - regardless of age - it will be a great environment to be part of.

4288~~~
Completely agree. Some seriously miss-placed revisionism going on to suggest otherwise.

4289~~~
How exactly did he turn a draw into our win? Did he have a good game?
It's just beyond silly if you consider him scoring, lets give him that Deeney OG, after a scuffle in a box a "force of will" or "leadership". That was just luck and an episode. His overall game in that match was dreadful. Watford basically overplayed us and in no small part that was down to Bastian's showing. It's same story with him, he hardly created chances for our players, he was not particularly good in returning the ball, even his passing accuracy was in low 70s in that game. So he could not even control the flow of the game. So apart from that shot he actually hardly done anything impressive in that game. Some leadership that.

4290~~~
They are faster? Doesn't really matter when Schneiderlin looks frightened when the football is passed to him, and Herrera a pale shadow of the player saw in the second half of 14/15. Not sure what driving runs you saw from the pair of them.

I don't think Schweinstieger can play as a DM so that's not my argument. He can be a very good central midfielder to us offering us things that Carrick can't. If he stays fit next season there's a good chance we will see just that happen.

Nearly everyone in our squad fits your definition of "deadweight" based on the 15/16 season.

4291~~~
That's a massive difference.

4292~~~
Yes, way faster.
Sure none of them had a good season, but first of all Bastian was the worst of them, his injury record must be taken into consideration since injured player can't play, it's that simple and Bastian was injured for half of the season in the last 3-4 seasons or something like that. He will be injured for quite a while next year as well, i am sure of it.
What things? Cause he offers nothing in attack. He hardly scores, hardly creates chances. The thing here is that ball distribution and intelligent moving and passing is admirable things of course but you can only rely on them in certain position. Deep lying DM playmaker is the one, that's why Carrick had so much success.
Sure there are some formations that can exploit Bastian like a 4-1-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3 with a 1-2 in midfield, when Bastian will have a DM that will work his socks of to get the ball back and more attacking player like peak Ander or even say someone like Pjanic who will be responsible for creating chances and managing the attacks, while Schweinsteiger will be kind of in-between guy, connecting things. But that a very specific formation, playing style, you need very specific DM and CM/AM for it that we don't really have. So why can he offer us? I think he will stay if Jose can't move him and will not be a main player next year. Can he be a useful squad player. Maybe, but he need to drastically raise his attacking game. We bought him gor his goals from midfield and he failed to deliver completely.
Sure, but some more than others.

4293~~~
Nobody really knows what he is on, there were a completely different figures in the papers ranging from 130-150k to 200k and even 200-250k. So the probability of him being on a 200k is roughly the same as 136k mentioned. Also it's a sure thing he got a signing-on fee that is usually paid out in installments. Maybe that difference between 136k and 200k is exactly that, his signing-on fee bonus.

4294~~~
Yeah, Schneiderlin and Herrera are really rapid. It's probably why they keep making driving runs into the opposition halves.

Oh wait..

Except he wasn't. Prior to his injury he was far better than the wank Schneiderlin served up all season. He wasn't at his best but given he's one of the best midfielders of his generation, that was still enough to be a lot better than a CM who didn't look capable on the ball.

The club is in a much better to judge this than you are. If they feel he can't remain fit we will sell him. If they feel he can, it's a no brainer to keep him.

Yes, it's called central midfield.

What things? You're asking me what things Bastian Schweinsteiger offers when he is fit?

Btw, Herrera scored 3 league goals last season. What a return. And Schneiderlin pretty much did nothing well.

What the feck is a "peak Ander"? Did you actually watch Herrera play last season? I really like the guy but he was awful. 

You're over complicating your mind/the discussion with all the formation/AM/DM. 

A fit Schweinsteiger offers plenty. He is a leader. He is composed and classy on the ball. He has a great touch. He runs his socks off. He can tackle. He gets forward and tracks back. The question is whether he can remain fit. It's the only question, really. He doesn't need to "raise his attacking" game because we didn't sign him for "goals from midfield". You sound like someone who hasn't followed him one bit. We need him to help us control and dominate games.

4295~~~
Sorry mate, he's cack. Having attended and watched many, many Bundesliga games I can absolutely say that I doubt any CM player accustomed to BL will ever adjust and dominate the PL. We've already seen Ballack, Hargreaves and Kagawa struggle and, for me, Gundogan is a signing that should worry City fans. It shows that Pep hasn't fully understood this league yet. 

At this point in his career there's very little chance Schweini can 'control and dominate games' for us. Mourinho might be a decent manager for him but is basically the only hope.

4296~~~
This makes no sense. Taking players who are no great shakes in Hargreaves and Kagawa, one that moved possibly too late and wasn't ideal given Lampard was already there, and a 31 year old, is hardly a good sample to decide "no CM player accustomed to BL will adjust and dominate in the PL". Why is it that Kante can do it from the French league yet noone can from a better BL?

4297~~~
Well if we compare their runs to Bastian, who hardly has any then it's quite obvious they both will come on top. but you will probably say that because of tactics, position, not because Bastian just can't make them. A moot point really.
When was that exactly? Which games?
Sure. And I trust Munich's judgement and they decided to bin the guy. Do i trust MU judgement? Well, lately not so much, Falcao, Di Maria and lots of other recent transfers support that doubt.

What is the last season exactly, since we are mid-season it can mean both 15-16 or 14-15. Ander was really good in the second half of 14-15, i would call that peak.
It's all wrong since you confused fit with "younger". For example Bastian in say September or October 15-16 season was fit, to suggest otherwise is completely ridiculous, any professional must be fit after a month of season without injuries. And was he a leader? No. Was he good on the ball? Not exactly, mostly side passing from him. He did not tackle much, did not really get forward that is proven by his lack of goals or chances created or any attacking action for that matter. I mean Bastian that we saw all fall and in the early winter is nothing like you described. As for his goals, even in an injury hit season for Munich the 14-15 one, he still scored and assisted enough, 5 goals and 4 assists.

4298~~~
It makes perfect sense if you've eyes and a brain mate. Have you? 

French league far closer to PL than BL. 

Kagawa 'no great shakes'? Scuse me? He was absolutely seen as a top, top player before he moved to United. Hargreaves also very highly regarded. How many of Hargreaves performances in CL did you see for Bayern? He was never able to replicate that level in England. 

It's easier in wide positions, but for a CM the PL is almost a different game from the BL and very hard to adapt to. 

Sounds like you're not to familiar with either league if you can't tell difference mate.

4299~~~
Nope, it's still a load of bullshit with almost no basis other than "I've watched a few games, MATE". It's more likely your eyes and brain that needs checking. Also, an attitude issue given how easily you get worked up and stray from logic to confrontation.

Kagawa was a very good player. He's nowhere near the level as the best players Germany has produced in recent times, like Schweinsteiger. To pick up a few players and decide "NO CM from Germany will succeed/dominate/do well in the PL" is a laughable statement, given it's one of the best leagues around.

Sounds like you think you know much much more than you and make sweeping generalizations which have little meaning.

4300~~~
Herrera and Schneiderlin come on top in "runs"? I'm not sure what that means exactly, but Schweinsteiger prior to his injury didn't lack in energy. He's older than the other two and like other great players when they age will have to learn to manage his body better than he would at 25 or Herrera would. But it hardly gives Herrera or Schneiderlin an advantage when they make little use of their younger age. 

Either way, we're arguing semantics, because the important decision to make is about whether he can remain fit. I personally believe that if he does he will do well next season and I'm not seeing enough great things from our other CMs to make his the "problem", unless of course, as Iv'e said before, we don't believe in his ability to stay fit.

Our midfield in general struggled last season. Partly due to themselves and partly due to what they were surrounded by. The lack of quality options doesn't help any of them. Barely any of them had "great" games (ignoring teams like Brugge). Watford away comes to mind, but like with Herrera and Schneiderlin, the good football was visible in patches. Something that was synonymous with our team as a whole.

Fair enough. It's an important decision, because we can't afford passengers next season if we want a proper tilt at the title. So hopefully they get their judgement on Schweinsteiger's fitness right. And to be fair, Munich's standards as of now are far higher than ours. His competition in midfield there weren't players like Schweinderlin, Fellaini and Herrera.

I don't. I'm not expecting him to play at his Munich level. I'm willing to take a version of him who performs at 70% of that level. The only difference between your stance and mine is that I'm a tad more optimistic about the level he can reach if fit, and I don't rate our other options as high. I don't think we have 4 top class options in CM ATM and his experience and class on the ball could benefit us big time.

4301~~~
But were there any CM players from Germany that successfully adapted in PL? Surely with Bundesliga selling as much as it had in recent year, there must be at least some examples.
I think Bundesliga can produce a good CM for PL and maybe Gundogan and Xhaka will be able to prove it, I also don't believe there is a predisposition for Bundesliga's CMs to fail in England. But from empirical point of view you can't really argue with <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/nuts.69262/">Nuts</a>, all central midfield players (attacking, defensive or in-between) from Germany from Ballack to Bastian were a failures in PL. Maybe we can find an examples in 90s but in recent time it's mostly flops.

4302~~~
Of course you can argue with a completely flawed opinion. Given it is based on nothing really. Plus even you confirm that you disagree with it.

It's hardly as if many top class Bundesliga CMs have gone to England in their prime of late. What are we basing it off? Just Ballack moving to Chelsea when they already had Lampard? That's an empirical argument?

4303~~~
They make more of them, they run faster.
What exactly did Bastian do in Watford game? Scored? Sure he managed to scramble one over the line, but overall his performance was dire and poor, just look at his passing accuracy for that game. Also Watford almost bossed the midfield, they created better chances and it was a lucky one. so much for "controlling the game".
The fact that no one can identify these so-called good games by Bastian onyl proves he had none. Or close to none, maybe like a couple. And there were some serious horror shows. For example in Wolfsburg. Was that before an injury? I think so. He would have been fit and yet he was shockingly bad.
I don't think he even had enough average games, whenever i remember our matches in fall or winter, like Arsenal away or 0-0 with City, Chelsea even better ones like Everton's win and the rest Bastian did not exactly cover himself in glory. Even against Leicester where he scored but his overall play was pretty poor. Just game a home against Swansea comes to mind when i think about when Bastian really fitted here at United and looked the part.
Well that's a very big "if". When exactly did Bastian stayed fit? Because he played only 20 and 22 matches in Bundesliga in the last two years prior to his move here. So has not "stayed fit" in more than three years in a row now. A very big "if".

4304~~~
Sure. That's empirical. Maybe Ballack and Bastian are on a decline, but their respective last seasons in Bundesliga were much better than their english ones. Surely a decline can't be that rapid and there is not much difference between say 30-years old player and a 31-years old one. So what does explain such a drop in performances level? Well their move to the England of course.
Why do you think Hargreaves that while had injury was more or less fit at Munich suddenly became a complete "misfit" and injury room regular in England after just a half a year.

4305~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11065/10306487/bastian-schweinsteiger-can-rediscover-form-away-from-man-utd-problems-says-franz-beckenbauer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...-from-man-utd-problems-says-franz-beckenbauer</a>

Franz Beckenbauer thinks BastianSchweinsteiger can rediscover his best form for Germany at Euro 2016 because he is away from the "problems" at Manchester United.

"Why? Because he is away from the problems at Manchester. I guess he is feeling really comfortable in the Germany squad."

Is this a dig at the club or the LVG regime?

4306~~~
It's not anything. Just Franz talking, you should not waste a second of thought about some relevant meaning because there isn't.

4307~~~
Well past his best....

4308~~~
Mate, how many CMs have come from the BL and really acclimatised well to the PL? Name them. 

Kagawa arrived with substantially higher potential than you are letting on. Read Fergie's quotes about him and pay special attention to what he said at the end of Kagawa's first season about the next season. 

It ain't gonna happen for Schweini. He's shot physically and Bayern knew that. He's got even less chance of making any impact than Ballack had and will struggle just the same.

Watch that match from when Watford equalized to the point when United took the lead back in injury time.

If you don't understand what leadership is... then you won't get it.

4311~~~
Never even said that. Christ..

4312~~~
A few points on this topic:

1. Regarding central midfielders from Bundesliga coming to the Premier League and failing, the fact is that barely any great ones are taking that particular route in their prime. When you have very few actually coming, you're bound to have very few successful ones, if any. Adjusting to a new league, particularly a top league, is always a tough thing to do. Sometimes players can do it and sometimes they can't. But it's definitely harder to make the adjustment the older you are when you make that move, or if you get lots of injuries while trying to make that adjustment. Which is why Ballack, Schweinsteiger and Hargreaves are unfit (lolz) to be taken as a basis for a sweeping generalization. Now, if we had the Xavi's and Iniesta's and Busquets' (or indeed Schweinsteigers') moving to England at the age of 25 and failing, then it is a different matter. Anyway, I guess we agree to disagree on this.

2. On the Kagawa point, it is to be noted that A) he wasn't a central midfielder and B) as per SAFs comments he was satisfied with his 1st season and expecting better things in his second, and sadly his manager in the second was David Moyes.

4313~~~
If I was a young up and coming player and had a chance to share the dressing room with Schweinsteiger and Zlatan and play under Mourinho...wow.

He was one of our better midfielders in the first half of the season IMO. Definitely has a part to play but that doesn't mean we should not stop looking to get a new player in there. He is past his best yes but still has enough to offer. Was much better than Herrera & Schneiderlin.

4314~~~
Not going to comment on the 'No CM from Germany succeeds here' bit because I don't think the numbers or the evidence come across as convincing enough. 

If BFS can stay fit, he should have a tactically planned out squad role, where he makes the bench week in week out and can calm things down when the team seems jittery in the second half. If Mourinho has his way in the transfer market, we're going to have a fair few new players in this summer. Add to that a lot of promising youngsters who haven't completely broken in yet, and you have a starting XI that might not have played a lot of football together. That is when the nerves could show, and that is when you put the experience of BFS to good use. Also, he is a natural leader of men, and the spine of the team could use his support in the dressing room as much as on the pitch.

4315~~~
He will be here next season..  The only question is will be stay fairly fit. Mou will use him in the right manner not playing two man midfield with Fellaini and his positional sense. He played very well the first half of the season but I hope with Mou he will be given the right role within the squad.

4316~~~
Yeah, Beckenbauer hasn't talked sense in ages.

<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

4317~~~
I wouldn't say Ballack failed at chelsea. Underwhelmed maybe, but still a very dependable top class midfielder.

And at the tailend, he turned into an understated world class midfielder again.

4318~~~
I thought Ballack was good too.

Not the goalscoring machine he was in Germany. But he changed his style of play and sat deeper for Chelsea.

4319~~~
Mate, lots of problems here. 

There's been plenty of Spanish midfielders who've moved and done well in the PL. 

You're spot on about Kagawa - he is more an attacking midfielder but my point encompasses anyone playing centrally down the spine. From Mertesacker, Ballack, Schweini, Rosicky etc - they have all struggled to adapt to pace of the game in PL. 

I know it cos I've seen a ton of Bundesliga games live. You think Xabi Alonso could start games for a team at the top of the PL at his age? No chance, but he's got the time on the ball in the BL to be able to start games for Bayern.

4320~~~
I've asked you what exactly had Bastian done in those minutes? Every fool can say stuff like "controlled the game" or "shown leadership". It means nothing without proper example. Just a way to divert attention.
For me leadership is making things happen like Rooney did in FA Cup final with his run or even in semis when he cleared Lukaku's shot. In my understanding "making things happen" can also be applied to defensive side of the game as well. In that episode Rooney never gave up, he fought to the end and made it. He has been a dividing figure to say the least and not on top of his form this term obviously, he was not even average. But in these instances he showed proper leadership. I don;t recall any examples like that from Bastian in Watford game or otherwise.

I always said that for Bastian Manchester United is just the last big meal ticket. He does not care one bit about a club and all these things, him training in Germany while supposedly "injured", miraculously being fit just in time for Euro - it all confirms it. He just duped the old fool (Van Gaal).

4321~~~
If Bastian can stay fit I believe he might be one of the best "signings" for the new season.
Mourinho has an reputation for ressurecting great players that seemed to have lost there Midas touch. From the top of my head I can remember Lucio, Samuel, Cambiasso, Terry, Ricardo Carvalho (with Real Madrid), Mota, Snjeider (dispensed by Real)... the list goes on and on.
He does love his experienced warriors and can inspire some last fighting spirit in them and I believe Bastian will benefit from that.
I would put my money on him and Rooney doing an hell of season next year.

4322~~~
You're right. He was great in the last ten minutes of that game. The bigger issue and what we seen more of in general last season was the 80 minutes that preceded it.

4323~~~
I thought he was good away at Watford and was good at home to West Ham in the cup when he came on. Helped drive us forward and his little shove on the keeper helped Martial score the equaliser.

Other than that he was a big let down. He was injured a lot and to be brutally honest didn't look that fit when he was playing. Always looked knackered.

If the squad role of veteran midfielder is between Carrick or Schweinsteiger I'd definitely go with Carrick.

4324~~~
Are you serious? Bundesliga has plenty of players or CM who'd be very good in the PL

4325~~~
BFS <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4326~~~
The pace!

4327~~~
Basti-gol! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4328~~~
Sell him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4329~~~
Good to see him again

4330~~~
Ready to rock and roll next season

4331~~~
My man!!!! Bursting through even with all that chest.

4332~~~
Great finish

4333~~~
Man like Basti!

Pleased for him!

4334~~~
That celebratory run to the technical area was the most he's run all season. Good job LVG saved him for this clincher...

4335~~~
feck <i>right </i>off

4336~~~
run basti, run!

4337~~~
I envision Mourinho lighting his fire again Lampard style <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4338~~~
What a way to return.

4339~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4340~~~
Happy for Bastian, he's had a difficult year.

4341~~~
Looked like the younger brother of the guy that played for us <span style="text-decoration: line-through">all</span> bits of this season.

4342~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4343~~~
Heroic goal.

4344~~~
BFS!

4345~~~
You can tell he's been working his arse off to get fit for this, he looks in much better shape than he did all season.

4346~~~
Man of the match?

4347~~~
He is completely out of breath in his post match interview <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Happy for him.

4348~~~
Nice goal from him and cool assist from Ozil..

4349~~~
He better keep that fitness during the summer and not let the moobs return.

No saüerkraut and bratwürst for you, basti.

4350~~~
Pleased for him. He has so much more to give, just need to stay the hell away from injuries.

4351~~~
And then realising Schweinsteiger is using that fire to cook a bag of marshmallows the size of a Mini Cooper.

4352~~~
Might be something to do with him being injured for a lot of the season, but he doesn't feel like one of our own yet. Hope he can stay fit so we can truly assess whether he might still have a role to play for us.

4353~~~
Made the finish look easy, if he stays fit I can still see a Big future for him under Jose

4354~~~
He was clearly running full pelt down the sideline during his celebration and it looked like a leisurely stroll. He's easily our slowest player, which is quite a feat with Carrick, Rooney and Mata in the team.

4355~~~
He's a class act no doubt about it, got a lot of grief on here last year but if he could get a run of games, he'd be an asset to us.

4356~~~
I might just be missing some sarcasm here, but if that's really what you believe then I don't know what to tell you, he was clearly not running as fast as he could <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4357~~~
I'm missing the sarcasm too, just a silly post really from Red Stone.  Quite typical of the cafe these days really, United player and football legend comes on for 3 minutes, looks good and scores a cracker, United fan comes on here to moan about how slow he is....

4358~~~
That'd require him to stay healthy.

4359~~~
Yeah. There's an incredible amount of ill-will, it seems. People making the claim that he's clearly got himself in much better shape for the EC than he bothered to keep himself in during his season with us. As if a player of his stature, who's been integral to some world class sides, has anything but the utmost drive and professionality.

Really gets my goat.

4360~~~
Fußballgott

4361~~~
What a player..

4362~~~
I want him to stay.

4363~~~
The German <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4364~~~
He's in great shape.

4365~~~
He isn't Vangled anymore.

4366~~~
Stil looks fat.

4367~~~

4368~~~
Did you see that point to where he wanted Ozil to play it?? Such authority in the point <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Seriously though, chuffed for the bloke... he was clearly thrilled by it, as he should be.

4369~~~
When I saw him after his celebration, yes. In that picture, no.

4370~~~
Breathing in.

4371~~~
Glad to hear that the man is back and fitter too.

4372~~~
Does this mean we can actually sell him then?

4373~~~
Hate all the negativity when the man has just scored a goal for his home nation that he captains. Yes, he wasn't great for us. But it was pretty difficult especially with Van Gaal in charge to try and play well.

I'm not putting it all down on Van Gaal, some of it is on Basti, but he will have a place in the team next season and if he can play for the world champions why can't he play for us? His quality is still undeniable and he is fitter than ever. If you think Basti now is fat then you must think Rooney and Luke Shaw are fat. 

Personally think he can become a starter for us, if he remains fit, and that is down to him. But I feel he will play a big part for us next season, mainly because it's bfs.

4374~~~
Mourinho got a perfect player in Schweiny for his style of play. The Ballack of Mou's United.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4375~~~
Mourinho will use him properly. The man oozes class and scores actual goals, his experience and winning mentality is very much needed in here. Fielding him together with hopefully Zlatan is going to be a lot of fun. Make no mistake that goal wasn't easy to take, but no problem for Basti. It's time for his second spring! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4376~~~
seems to be a lot of excitement about him after scoring one goal. for me i won't forget everytime ive seen him play since the world cup he has looked like not even a shadow of the guy he once was, and that was when he was fit.

unfortunately he signed for united at least 2 years too late, we bought a name not a player and he is no longer that great world class player who it use to be such a joy to watch

Great to see him score though, always nice to see a legend have another moment of Glory on the big stage!

4377~~~
He's going to be mortified having hi-fived Löw in his celebration with the video that came out. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Probably still washing his hands.

4378~~~
Found it a bit weird how everyone shat on him all season. He was far from our biggest problem. Hell, you can make a very strong case to him actually looking like our most competent midfielder when he was fit this season, considering how shite the rest were most of the time. He still has quality in him and showed it on occasion, though it was hard with Van Gaal being manager and us having nothing in attack. Mourinho will know how to manage his game time and get the best out of him. Sure he isn't what he was at his best, but he can still be quality and play a very useful role.

4379~~~
We are going to have a fantastic team next year! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just seen it after reading your comment!

4381~~~
Exactly. It was weird to see people questioning his work rate when that was not a problem at all. His work rate, movement was all great except his preference to play safe pass in the final third. 

He contributed in the defense and as well as in the attack, only problem was his passing in the final third where he took 0 risks. 

I have no doubt that he will be a big asset for us this season with the way Jose sets up his team.

4382~~~
This. 

There is no doubt that BFS is our best midfielder when fit, and when used in the right way. When he played last season you could see he was a level above the other midfielders at the club. However, whether it was due to fitness issues, or instructions from Van Gaal we never really go to see the performances that he is capable of over a sustained period of time.

I have every confidence that Mourinho will not only manage his game time in the right way, but will make a better use of the talent that BFS possesses. On his day he is still one of the best cm in world football. Let's not forget that.

4383~~~
Experience is overrated in here, it might be the difference in the Final of a cup game, or in a very tight title winning 1-2 matches, but before that kicks in you actually have to win the 98% of the other match

4384~~~
I couldn't disagree more, experience is vital and helps the other players through every game. The balance has to be right but it is vital.

4385~~~
I really can't understand some people on here. We have the captain of the world champions at our club, he comes on and scores a goal for his country and people moan. Other people previously call him a has been. He isn't what he was because of injuries, but if he stays fit he is clearly still a quality player. He doesn't rely on any particular trait such as speed that will deteriorate rapidly the older he gets. He's a born leader and that is something we clearly lack. There is absolutely a place for him in our squad. He is BFS ffs.

4386~~~
only if the player is actually playing and on the field, experience behind the screen is overrated. We had many PL winners, carrick won a loads of them, does it help on the pitch?

4387~~~
What? Experience is vital. Ferguson as an example always went on about experience and how important it was that you know how to win. You need a balance at the very least.

4388~~~
Mostly on the pitch as that is where results are gained but also off pitch. Where the squad spends the majority of time. There is much more to football than the 90 min match every week and having experienced players in the squad is vital. To set the tone in the training and the mood in the camp. There is loads more but experienced players should certainly not be undervalued.

4389~~~
I fecking love the guy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Two of my all time favourite players soon to be walking out in United red! Amazing.

4390~~~
Looked surprisingly fit - might be a good season in him yet - well taken goal.....

4391~~~
Basti reminded us of his class with a sublime finish, if only he had bullet proof knees. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4392~~~
Agree with this. Experience is what people tend to use to praise a player they like when they can no longer praise their actual performances.

4393~~~
Nope. Can't believe anyone who has watched us over the last few decades could say that.

4394~~~
Yeah, because those other "98% of the matches" aren't close at all.

4395~~~
He was absolutely terrible last season. Maybe he'll finally decide he wants to be fit and put in some decent performances for a change. Not holding my breath though. I'd rather keep Schneiderlin tbh and he's not very good.

4396~~~
I dont get why he's suddenly a fussballgott again after scoring a decent goal, the bias around him is huge. Let him have a decent streak for us again and I could understand that.

4397~~~
People saw what they wanted to see with him and not what he actually did (Which was generally nothing). After every game you had hordes of people deluging this thread with a string of posts about how amazaballs his leadership was. Quite hilarious really.

Also hilarious (but not specific to this thread) is this notion that literally every player in the squad was under performing and has been 'Van Gaal'ized' (Except Fellaini of course. He's dogshit even when he's the best player on the pitch). Well, if all our players are that good then what's with the widespread clamour to  sign loads of players and spend millions?

4398~~~
It's not really anything new, that's United fans for you, so many of them love to shit on anything and everything Manchester United. Constant overreactions and negativity.

4399~~~
He wasn't "absolutely terrible" but he didn't do enough in the games he was actually fit for. Hopefully the Germans don't win it because I can see him going mad at the buffet again

4400~~~
Yeah I feel the same. When you think of Schweinsteiger you still think of Bayern, Well I do anyways..

4401~~~
Where was all those experience gone during Moyes era?

Vidic/Rio/Evra/Giggs (as coach)/Rafael/DDG, everyone of our squad has won at least 1 title, Rio Vidic Evra have won the whole lot.

EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I love BFS and I do think he's still world class, but if he's going to play his part it should be because he is world class technically on the pitch, not just his "experience"

4402~~~
He wasn't terrible at all. He was quite good in many games. His injury problems are a concern but otherwise he was quite good. I still remember the Watford game (the one he forced Deeney to score an OG) where young lost the ball in their half and schweinsteiger ran the length of the pitch to defend a 1v1.

He was much better than Carrick and Herrera last season imo

4403~~~
He wasn't anywhere near his best last season but he was easily our best midfielder, and actually only midfielder who was doing what midfielders are supposed to do. Our midfielders were either hiding in the majority of our games(Schneiderlin, Carrick), were shit(Herrera) were good on moments but don't really play like midfielders are supposed to play(Fellaini, Rooney). 

In the games where van Gaal subbed him we would usually collapse, the difference was enormous even though you couldn't maybe say that he was individually great.

4404~~~
To be fair to Bastian last season, most of his passes seemed to just be sideways and he wasn't able to provide that spark we were hoping for - mainly due to the fact we had such poor to non existent movement forward/in behind the defence.  So it will be very interesting to see how he gets on if we have players running in behind or at least runners allowed to deviate from their fixed position.  I am optimistic he will improve for us this season, granted this obviously is dependent on his fitness as well which is a seperate matter.  But fingers crossed he is fit enough to be a big player for us this season, he could really be a massive player for us, especially in the big games.

4405~~~
Let's not get carried away because he scored a goal. He managed to play 5 minutes. He was absolutely knackered by half time in the PL.

4406~~~
I think next season it would be between him and Carrick for deep lying play making position.

4407~~~
He's had a bit of time off so hopefully he can play the tournament and then pretty much join up with us without requiring much rest. Didn't think he'd make the tournament in time with the knee injury he had but good to see its working ok. Great player.

4408~~~
He not really old (only 31-32), but he looks like, and play like a 42 yrs old.

4409~~~
Basti
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4414~~~
He will enjoy the silence at United...

His legs are so gone.

4422~~~
Has looked much better in the second half though.

4423~~~
Been brilliant all game (well since coming on)

4424~~~
Yet has got better as the game has gone on, looks top drawer now.

4425~~~
If he can keep fit he will be useful, but he has to be more productive. One goal and two assists is not enough.

4426~~~
It's not his job to do either of those, he's a controller and a tempo setter. I think he'll surprise a lot next season, almost a forgotten man

4427~~~
I think he's been extremely average.

With his constant injuries and lack of fitness I believe he'll be wasting a space in the squad next season.

4428~~~
Looks fit to me, in fact, if I'd never seen either play before and you asked me which German CM I'd sign from this game it wouldn't be Kroos.

4429~~~
he's great but theres a lot of him now isn't there

4430~~~
He looks fitter than he did for United last season. I'd like him to stay if he keeps it up, he is 'only' 31 after all.

4431~~~
Look forward to seeing him in action for us again

4432~~~
Being kind there. Been awful barring a brief 5 minute spell in the 2nd half where he was ok.

4433~~~
He wont go anywhere.

4434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4435~~~
It's not his best game but he's done very well against a very very solid Italy team and there is a thread called "Wayne Rooney,  Midfield General".

Goodness me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4436~~~
I know. His positioning had me in stitches as well. Was a liability in the first half.

4437~~~
He's been pretty good

4438~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Kroos hiding and BFS getting attacked here

4439~~~
Positioning? In a game in which Germany have totally dominated and Italy have looked as dangerous as a toy soldier?...... o k

That probably goes down as the strangest observation I've ever read.

4440~~~
He probably means when Kimmich slept and played the Italian onside

4441~~~
Err... Yes. 

In his defense Kronos has been garbage as well.

4442~~~
Don't worry, we will be hearing how Rooney would have dominated this match instead. 

Just wait for it.

4443~~~
Nar, Akash can't surely be a Rooney in midfield fan and call this awful.  No one is that fuxking stupid.

4444~~~
Think he's been good. Holding the midfield well.

4445~~~
Kroos has been average but has had a very good tournament. Germany have looked far worse with Schweini filling in for Khedira.

4446~~~
Playing against a miles better side to be fair, still dominating.

4447~~~
Tbf, one would have to be a wizard to produce a CM masterclass performance in a game of this magnitude.

4448~~~
Why the hell take a pen when you're a nervous wreck? Foolish of such an experienced player.

4449~~~
I think he was genuinely in tears when he stepped up

4450~~~
Fellaini and LVGs fault.

4451~~~
He's a truely awful penalty taker. It's great that he wants to take the crucial ones, but he's really really bad at it. He's a nervous wreck, every time. It was the same in the CL final in 2012. I love him and I thought he played really well today, but he really shouldn't take penalties.

4452~~~
Reminds me of Rooney, ambling around in slippers most of the time.

4453~~~
If you play for United or Arsenal you dont take penalties for the national team EOD.

4454~~~
Yeah you could tell on his face he was shitting it. Surprising because with his mentality and the type of person/player he is you would think he would be able to stay calm and slot them home.

4455~~~
They are playing italy instead of slovakia though. So yeah.

4456~~~
Beckenbauer was the same, he hated taking penalties and was pretty bad at it. It's a different type of mentality that players need for shootouts.

4457~~~
Thought he played well. Awful Pen. Fussballgott with flaws.

4458~~~
I think he looked alright. He was slow to get into the game but as the game wore on he seemed to be more comfortable. The penalty was very poor but it'll soon be forgotten

4459~~~
At least his pointing still works <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4460~~~
That's weird that two of the most German players ever hate it.

4461~~~
He didn't look like the guy who is sure of his pen. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 
But he was good overall.

4462~~~
He was unsurprisingly good for Germany, hope we see that in a United shirt.

<b>MF Bastian Schweinsteiger, 7</b> -- Replaced Khedira after only 15 minutes. Needed time to get into the match, but the German captain was hungry and out to prove he can still go a full match. Lifted his side with his hunger and his determination, taking the pressure off Kroos. Giaccherini escaped his marking for Italy's best chance in the first half. Could have sent his XI into the last four but instead sent the ball into the night like a true Englishman.

4464~~~
Meanwhile, the most unprofessional player in the world is a genius penalty taker. Balotelli, if anyone's wondering.

4465~~~
I love the lad, i am sure he will play an important part for us next season

4466~~~
Injured.

4467~~~
Again.

I expect his fitness issues are a concern to United. I'm not convinced he's completely safe from any cull.

4468~~~
Oh FFS, got a knock on the inside of his knee, hope he can recover.

4469~~~
His movement wasn't good in the first half. I wouldn't worry too much. We'll see how he is in pre season

4470~~~
Any translation, how bad, how long?

4471~~~
Got a knock on the inside of his knee, they say 'Außenbandzerrung'. Cant say how long he will be out, they need to watch from day to day to see how the progress goes and evaluate the situation. They work on getting him fit. Dont know if he can play in the semis or final.

Doesnt sound severe

4472~~~
The man is a winner more than anyone else he epitomizes what our youngsters should aspire to be particularly after the Giggs loss. The manager shouldn't expect fifty games from his battered body but treat him like Fergie handled Scholes in the sunset of his career, pick and choose where he plays and design a special training program for him.

4473~~~
And yet reports were that a number of the squad didn't like him and the way he was treated. Young players are always asked about how the senior players help them and he was never mentioned by any of them. Shaw made a comment on every player in the squad except for Schweinsteiger. He may have been a great leader for Bayern and Germany but it looks pretty evident he isn't this huge figure in our dressing room that some like to believe.

4474~~~
Very true. The tactical approach of both sides was designed to destroy the opponent's build up and attacking play above all else. Extremely tight spaces, quasi-man-marking, almost no options to pass to.

4475~~~
Tbh you are clutching at straws a bit there, he has endured one season where everything went to shit and some of the players didn't cover themselves in the best of lights. These are the same players that turned on Van Gaal because they couldn't handle being told the truth in front of their mates, turned on Moyes because he took their chips... No wonder they prefer an overweight, overpaid, past it, Scholes wannabe to a true winner thats been there and done that.

4476~~~
Practically all of that last sentence applies to Schweinsteiger.

4477~~~
It's a long season and we have the Europa league to contend with, will be worth while keeping him for that.

4478~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Not to mention the insinuation that Rooney hasn't 'been there and done that.'

4479~~~
Not for the NT

4480~~~
We aren't a NT.

4481~~~
We still talk about football.

4482~~~
We are United, Rooney has been there and won everything for United. Trying to say he isn't a 'true winner and hasn't been there and done that' based on England being shite is just absurd. Rooney has won every domestic competition we will play in, he has also won the CL, he has the experience of winning everything we want to win.

4483~~~
Well Schweinsteiger has done more than Rooney at club and international level. He never said aynthing about Rooney, so his point still is correct, Schweinsteiger has done it more than Rooney. Let it go now

4484~~~

4485~~~
Yea (gutted to say this as I was so excited to sign him) but I think that he should be quietly shipped back to Germany before the season starts.  Should be clearly behind Schneiderlin

4486~~~

4487~~~
Schweinsteiger was in full training today and is expected to start tomorrow again.

4488~~~
Hope he does well tomorrow

4489~~~
Hope he destroys France and Pogba. Come on Basti, roll back the years.

4490~~~
We should have signed Giggs on to be our fitness coach. Anyone over the age of 30 has to get on PlanGiggs or get on PlanGTFO.

4491~~~
There's no need, Giggs did Yoga a lot but I'm sure I read Jones does it as well. The Jones oap yoga class is going to happen. It's only a matter or time

4492~~~
Starting tonight vs France. 

Big game for him to show the doubters he's still got it.

4493~~~
His start tonight means he's set a new record for appearances at major finals (World Cup and Continental cup). I believe they said this will be his 38th match, which is a record for any player from any nation.

Some achievement that!

4494~~~
Bossing the game again today, took the steam out of France's early spell by just playing keep ball and now pulling the strings

4495~~~
Yeah. Best i've seen him play since becoming a united player. A fit schweinie could be brilliant. Have my doubts

4496~~~
He's been very good so far in this game.

4497~~~
Class. Hope he can stay fit next year. Him and Pogba in midfield would be delightful.

4498~~~
Based on his work tonight, the end of Basti might have been announced much too soon. Bossing it.

4499~~~
I hope we don't change it for Matuidi. PSG would have a leader in their team.

4500~~~
He's great, hopefully he's fit and ready for the season.

4501~~~
I hope he can replicate this next year

Absolutely Bossing it so far

4502~~~
playing in a team who actually know what they are doing

4503~~~
Smashing it so far. Absolute scenes when we have him Schneiderlin and Pogba in one midfield.

4504~~~
Best player on the field at the moment.

4505~~~
If only he was a few years younger and not injury prone, he'd be the player we'd be wanting drop £100 m on.

But reckon if we get a good offer we should move him on still, because he won't do this for us consistently next season.

4506~~~
Great to see him play well. If he can keep up his fitness level, he for sure can play an important role next season

4507~~~
Based on tonight`s game we can save the 120 Mio on Pogba and go with Schweini.

4508~~~
He's playing in a very dominant team here so he can look like a Kaizer in this lineup. Don't be deceived into expecting him to perform like this for us week in week out. . we are nowhere near this german team.

4509~~~
With a sane person in charge its possible.

4510~~~
He's one hell of a squad player to have.

4511~~~
Basti has his injury problems but one thing he hasn't lost is his composure. I still don't know how much he has left in the tank to go in his career but he's been good.

4512~~~
So past it /s

Edit: Great! I jinxed him<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4513~~~
Wow.

4514~~~
Loser.

4515~~~
Forget what I said.

4516~~~
Timing...

4517~~~
Did he think the ball was a kids' football themed birthday cake, or something?

4518~~~
Hero to zero

4519~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Forget I said that. Shocking stuff <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4520~~~
Shame for that handball, but they'll recover. He has more than double touches than caf's poster boy who looks lost on the pitch once again. And Schweinsteiger is probably half fit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4521~~~
This has really not been a great tournament from United perspectives.

4522~~~
Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger !!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4523~~~
He's been playing well.

But was a pure idiot for that penalty.

4524~~~
He's had a good half operating in a dominant 3 man midfield with 2 #8's ahead of him, kinda like how Carrick did for us season before last when we played the system. We have so many players that we'd get more out of in a proper 4-3-3 but with Rooney needing to be accommodated they become less useful. .

4525~~~
Very good up until that situation. Would love to see him playing regularly with his new and better teammates.

4526~~~
thats what you get when you play him in the right position, he is still one of the best in the world in this role. Shame about the hand but from our perspective its irrelevant, its great to see him play like this again.

4527~~~
Moment of madness from Basti. Ruined a very solid first half with a stupid handball.

4528~~~
Disregarding that handball, he's been absolutely brilliant.

Hopefully can replicate that type of performance for us.

4529~~~
I don't get the criticism. Schweini has been massive this game. He's been bossing the midfield, had some great tackles and interceptions and been a vital part of the team - DESPITE suffering through injuries. Meanwhile Pogba is almost invisible and no one is saying anything.

4530~~~
Been the best midfielder on the pitch. Looked more like a 100m player than the other guy in a blue shirt

4531~~~
I dont think he has enough ability on the ball to play in midfield for us, we wont zombie pass like under LvG under Mourinho with our attackers, we need someone who's able to speed up the game with fast passing, dribbling, through balls etc, Schweini plays at such low pace.

4532~~~
Kroos and Ozil have been far better.

4533~~~
Let's hope he brings this form to United! LVG managed him all wrong, just like he did basically everyone.

4534~~~
Schweinsteiger still the best.. Just needs to be fit... Controls the midfield give him and attacking quartette to play with we have a good side.

4535~~~
I think at times this year he didn't return or took longer returning than needed to save energy for the Euros. Fair enough I say.

4536~~~
They really haven't.

That handball is clouding your judgement imo.

Schweinsteiger has been instrumental in the 1st half.

4537~~~
Kroos has been better but Bastian is still brilliant. Would be stupid to sell him now

4538~~~
Ozil has been terrible. Kroos has been just as influential though, Germany are pouring forward and the passing options are everywhere for the two.

4539~~~
I think they really have, they've been pretty much faultless and contributing with some very decisive passes which could end up in goals.

4540~~~
Ozil terrible, by what standards? He consistently splits up their defence with his smart passes and touches.

4541~~~
I won't say he has been Germany's best player, Kroos has been better imo but the penalty aside I am pleased with his performance. Hope he stays. If fit, his skills and experience will be invaluable in midfield. Play him in a proper midfield 3 without the team doing random sideways passing and he can be very useful.

4542~~~
He's made 4/5 crucial interceptions so far. Excellent game so far, shame about the handball.

4543~~~
I thought Schweinsteiger was (mostly) brilliant. Great defensive contribution and good build up play from deep, the complete package. But he gave away a dangerous free kick and a completely unnecessary penalty, which mars his performance.

4544~~~
You're only going to get these performances out of Schweinsteiger sparingly over the season, but he's well worth sticking around. He could be fantastic as a player you bring on or start occassionally. There's still a lot left in him.

4545~~~
He really couldnt keep up with Giroud?

4546~~~
Shame a good performance will be marred by that shocking mistake.

4547~~~
Hope he stays and stays fit

4548~~~
Played really well. Could be a big player this season for us.

4549~~~
Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0ur1H9H9_Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Deutscher fußballmeister, deutscher fußballmeister, deutscher fußballmeister Bastian!

4551~~~
He was good, no worries. Mou will keep him

4552~~~
What the actual feck was he smoking! It would have literally been the last bit of action of the first half and Germany totally dominated.

4553~~~
Hope he announces his retirement and focuses only on us.. Still a very good player.. Definitely can do a job in the midfield when fit

4554~~~
Hopefully Mourinho can use him a bit more strategically than LVG did. The team is lacking leaders and he could be a level head in bigger games.

4555~~~
He also lost Griezmann before the second goal. He was his man.

Very odd performance. A really good overall game and two decisive mistakes (there were more players involved in the second goal, of course).

But he has shown that he's a complete midfielder and still capable of playing on a high level. It will be mainly a matter of fitness next season.

4556~~~
Not the player he was but still plenty to give. I think Jose can get two more 7.5/10 seasons out of him.

4557~~~
Looks the same as Carrick to me, lacks the legs and mobility for a 2 man midfield but in the cocoon of a proper 3 man midfield he might scrape another season, that's if he can stay fit.

4558~~~
Still a lot to offer and a quality player. Genuine leader and will be better next season once used properly.

4559~~~
It is just one game.

Way too much spotlight on tournie matches.

4560~~~
Wish he'd shoot more often when he does actually get forward. Feel like we're owed at least one of those goals from him

4561~~~
I agree.

As for Schweinsteiger going forward he kind of reminds me of Rooney, in that he is just so slow off the mark these days.

4562~~~
Thought he was great.   Mou will keep him.

4563~~~
He didn't do anything at all for me last season and I predicted as much

But feck it I want to see pretty much every player we have been given another chance this season

But I think he will go this summer

4564~~~
I didn't want to imply anything else. The crucial sentence was "it'll be a matter of fitness". Knowing that he hasn't been in good physical shape for at least 2 years, there's definitely a huge question mark.

4565~~~
This. He is and can still be a quality player.

4566~~~
He'd a good game except that Pen which I still think was harsh and proved that he's still a lot to offer.

4567~~~
Disagree. Kroos is hiding with his defensive work. I can't tell who is 30+ years old between Bastian and Kroos in term of defensive work rate. Kroos passing game is as influential as always but he needs other doing his part in defending. 

Bastian still has it at top level, but he will need to be carefully managed as his fitness won't allow him to carry the same high workload week in week out. His composure is valuable in certain circumstances and it's extremely hard to buy the same quality in this market.

4568~~~
He is a natural leader and has such a silky touch.   JM will get the best out of him that is for sure!

4569~~~
If he is able to feature a lot next season, my choice for club captain.

4570~~~
Should feature as often as possible next season imo.

4571~~~
Had a good match last night. The first half performance was as good as I have seen him play in a long time. He still looks like he is carrying a little weight though. Still this tournament has been good for him/us with him out injured for so long at the back end of last season, its been a way to get fit.

Let us hope he can stay relatively injury free. He needs to curb his style a little bit I think. There is no reason why he cant perform a holding role for us and his leadership speaks for itself. Congratulations also on breaking the appearance record at major tournaments.

Legend

4572~~~
Rooney captains this guy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4573~~~
I've got a feeling that he's managing an injury a little like Ledley King used to so it's difficult for him to manage his weight with cardio. 

I'm not saying he's so crocked that he can't train, just that he probably needs to  go easy to manage his body which has taken a beating over the years.

Ditto Rooney.

4574~~~
I am excited to see him have another crack at this season, especially with Jose. It's obvious he's not "finished". I mean he may not be the Schweinsteiger of the past, but he'll still be a damn improvement on the likes of Herrara.

4575~~~
Excellent last night in the first half. Dictated everything.

4576~~~
He released a statement on his twitter in German. It's a picture, so I can't translate. Wonder if our German resident fans can translate it for us? <a class="username" data-user="66319, @OutlawGER" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66319/">@OutlawGER</a> <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a> <a class="username" data-user="88167, @slig" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88167/">@slig</a>

4577~~~
Puh, its a bit much to translate it word by word. All in all he says 
- there was missing some luck in the match
- thanks to the fans, and to France for the tournament, congratulations to the team of France
- proud of the teamspirit and the play-style of germanys team

4578~~~
I thought he was retiring from the national team or something, he had written a story lol

4579~~~
My favorite player, hopefully he can stay fit next season and he can find a place in the first 11.

4580~~~
Imagine Rooney captain Bastian & Zlatan this coming season <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> worthy? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4581~~~
It wasn't a mistake, and it wasn't stupid. 

Basti had that hand up to pull his man down, and to make the jump himself. But since Evra was jumping away, Basti ended up leaning a bit too much towards him, and got in  the way of the ball. Not deliberate at all. Very very harsh from a possibly pissed off Italian ref.

4582~~~
You what mate <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4583~~~
You don't go jumping for a ball with your hand in the air without looking at the ball and then leave said hand hanging in the air. It was deliberate in the same way you're trying your hardest to catch a player from behind but you run across the back of his legs and 'accidently' catch them. Of course you don't mean to but your momemtum will ALWAYS take you there; that player beat you with his positioning thus you commited a foul. 

He misjudged the flight of the ball AND wasn't touch tight to Evra so he desperately jumped with his head AND hand in an attempt to stop the ball; unfortunately for him the ball hit his hand whilst he was in no man's land. 

Just because he looked sheepish doing it, doesn't mean he didn't know what he was doing. 

<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/08/bastian-schweinsteiger-handball-intentional-germany-france-penalty" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/footbal...r-handball-intentional-germany-france-penalty</a>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoKZf7x62z4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I guess the last sentence there is important but surely it's up the ref's discretion? It blocked a clear goal scoring opportunity (direct at the goal or indirectly i.e it might have set up a team mate).

Still that's none of our concern really. Thought he played very well and hoping he gets lots of playing time under Mourinho.

4584~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4585~~~
Bloody joke, isn't it.

Jose needs to strip him of it and hand it to Zlatan with Basti as Vice.

4586~~~
He has great technique and control but is lacking physically and just doesn't do enough. Needs to have a better season or he will be on the way out.

4587~~~
I would suspect Mourinho might have an idea how to use him properly.

Certainly we need the Bastian from the first half of the game against France dictating play and getting about the pitch.

4588~~~
Think he's suggesting that Schweinsteiger is a natural born Führer whereas Rooney is not and it should be the other way around. 

Which is wrong on so many levels...

4589~~~
He was fairly shite last year, and whats worse for me is he kept jetting off back to Germany at every opportunity. His injury record going on 3 years now is tragic, he has a lot to prove next season regardless of his muppet star standing.

4590~~~
The German (and Serbian) yellow press are all over Venice today...

Married...



Let's look if or how long it takes United to follow

4591~~~
Basti und Ana <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4592~~~
Can we have the German NT Bastian next year please?

4593~~~
Hope he doesnt indulge on too much cake today, needs to stay trim

4594~~~
I really hope he stays another season at least. Think he has more to offer.

4595~~~
Maybe he has more to offer, but what does it matter when he can't stay injury free?

4596~~~
I think Mou wants to axe him.

4597~~~
Sell Bastian 
Sell Mata
Keep Fellaini <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4598~~~
Especially if he retires from international football. I hope we keep him for another year or two

4599~~~
feck sake. I've been in the same street today. If I knew he would have been there I would have stayed to take a photo.

4600~~~
Be surprised if he's with Utd next season. Best for both if he moves on.

4601~~~
All three are going, and it will be glorious.

4602~~~
I think Mourinho likes him and wants to try him, so he'll stay at least another season.
Physically he looked in good shape and he played well, if he stays injury free I'm pretty sure he can translate that into the PL season. That if is a pretty big if tho.

4603~~~
Another signing that hasn't really worked out so far but at £6.3m was worth the risk.

I think we should sell if rumours of PSG wanting him are true.

Blind, Carrick, Schneiderlin, Herrera, Pogba*, TFM, Pereira and Rooney as a last resort should be good enough for us this season.

4604~~~
Rumours about PSG interest. Dont think he had planned to go to PSG when he left Bayern, Jose might have change his mind. I think he will be given a chance to see how he trains, but it wont surprise me if leaves.
