1~~~
He may struggle to nail down a place this season.

2~~~
Luke Shaw better be on top of his fitness this season because Blind won't find many games in midfield and consequently push him harder for the starting left back spot.

3~~~
Yeah, I think that's pretty accurate. Injuries aside, he's behind Carrick, Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger for a role as a deep lying midfielder. He'll get games but he may well end up as a squad player, which isn't a bad thing.

4~~~
I hope he still gets a few games for us in midfield, even if its just in Cup games. I think he has more potential to be a very good player there than he does at LB. His versatility will most likely prove to be his most useful asset but I definitely see him and being better at DMF in the long run.

5~~~
LvG will probably convert him to a CB and not buy one.

6~~~
I have a feeling he will displace Shaw as the starting LB pretty quickly.

7~~~
Tbh i thought he was playing pretty well there last night (until he gave away a stonewall penalty at least)

8~~~
Agreed, he was doing fine, not really imaging him as a CB with our high line in the PL but stranger things have happened.

9~~~
His lack of pace is a big problem when playing LB.....

10~~~
Needs to get rid of the man bun and bring back his flowing hair... Main problem with him at the moment really

11~~~
100% pass completion

12~~~
He handled the likes of Townsend 
Sterling and all well last season.

13~~~
Blind is our new Nicky Butt, who happens to be a cool LB <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

14~~~
I don't think he will get many games this season unless Shaw screws up his fitness again.

15~~~
He will still get to play a significant amount IMO due to his versatility. Besides I still reckon he is a very good midfielder. With CL and two domestic cup competitions he should be able to get 25-30 games next season.

16~~~
Yep, I see no issues about his playing time at all. Plenty of games in midfield and hopefully Van Gaal sees him as our second left back, I am a little concerned that he overrates Blackett in that position though.

17~~~
Blind is definitely our second choice left back IMO. Blackett played mostly out of necessity.

18~~~
I like the man bun <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

19~~~

20~~~
I'm not sure where this summer's signings leave Blind. I thought he had a good first season and I really enjoyed some of his performances in the anchor role but the signings of Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin would appear to limit his appearances in that position.

Maybe LVG plans to play a double pivot of Carrick and Schweinsteiger with Blind being first rotation for that role but I don't think so. I hope he still has a long-term future for us in midfield.

21~~~
He'll play, that's for sure. Whether that's at LB, CM, DM, or CB, it's hard to tell. But, given how injury prone some of our players are, Blind is almost guaranteed a decent amount of games.

22~~~
I agree that he will likely get games regardless as he is so versatile, but I don't love the idea of a 180 cm something player starting at cb for us.

23~~~
He is going to find it tough, there are much better options in midfield now, shaw looks fitter and darmian is a good let back as well. He is well down the pecking order in midfield and as a centre half, left back looks his best bet to be a regular starter but his versatility means he will get games throughout the season in various positions.

24~~~
I think he will always be good back-up. I can't see us ever relying on him as a regular starter. The way the game is these days and with the additional games the CL provides then he's still very much needed. He will easily play 20-25 games next season as he can cover for LB, CB and CM. With our injury problems, then it's likely there will be a lot of rotation within the squad.

25~~~
He was excellent for most of last season and he will get his fair share of games in this one.

26~~~
So how did he do?

27~~~
Less bad than vs Club America, but he doesnt really take initiative as a CB so Jones stood out. Decent I guess.

28~~~
Deputy left back is the best he can hope for this season.

29~~~
I really hope he doesn't.

30~~~
He's very lucky that our defenders all seem to have issues staying fit or he would've been looking for another club in the near future. He's a good player, but I think he and Rojo were bought specifically with us thinking of playing with 3 at the back. Now that plans have changed and we signed midfielders, he's about as low in the pecking order as one can be. Shaw, Darmian, Rojo and Blind are potentially who we can use at LB and in midfield he's competing with Carrick, Schneiderlin and Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger.

31~~~
His games in midfield are regarded as disastrous and it wasnt even close like that. Sure he wasnt as good as Carrick but he wasnt terrible either.

32~~~
His best performances were at LB, I also liked at DM even if he had some bad games there.

33~~~
A couple of dodgy games at the end but for the most part he was pretty consistent.

34~~~
Yup. His games at LB were solid too.

35~~~
Why on earth would LvG see him as CB, not a chance he will be up to the job there.

He does seem like a player that will always be in the team no matter what though......LvG's comfort blanket maybe.

36~~~
Starting at CB tonight.

37~~~
I'm happy with him starting as long as we don't get Ramos, i love Blind and if he can be a solid CB then we've basically got another playmaker in our first 11<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
I'd actually prefer him over Jones with Smalling as the other CB.

38~~~
Except that didn't happen last season with less competition!

I can see why he's trying him there, im not sure he's physical enough personally but he reads the game well and van gaal likes his CBs to be able to play from the back. First true test tonight.

39~~~
Generally speaking Blind played when he was fit, unless I'm going lala

40~~~
Gotta feel Rojo will take that place once fit, right?!

I think hes a really good lB and a solid DM. Actually think Carrick is a better CB than him, lol.

41~~~
He was consistent as a holding midfielder when he first arrived. Nothing spectacular, but still Mr. Reliable. It's his performances that waned in the second half of the season when he played that position. He did well at LB too, but a highlight of his game was obviously his link-up play with Young and Fellaini on the left hand-side, while also his intelligence in the role. Still think his best attributes suit a holding midfield role though, but he has far too many shortcomings to become a first choice #6 here IMO.

Hopefully we will see the end of this CB experiment soon enough. He clearly isn't cut out for it and I can only see it ending disastrously if LVG continues to persist with it.

42~~~
His philosophy really seems to be if they can't get the ball, we win.

43~~~
Some dodgy positioning aside that lead to their one on one in the first few mins he's had a cracking half. Well in Daley!

44~~~
Didnt see the first 15 min but he has been class from 15 - 45, well played.

45~~~
I think he's playing well. He's technically good on the ball, and I don't think people realise how much that matters for LvG.

46~~~
Played really quite well, been the best centreback on the pitch.

47~~~
blind has proved he doesnt need pace to defend at LB. so why would he need to prove it at CB. Phil Jones needs pace because he's reactive. Blind has done well in my opinion

48~~~
Deserves some credit after the shit storm he received before the game. Had a great game.

49~~~
I was one of those who doubted him but he played well aside from maybe the first few minutes. Well done.

50~~~
Did good. Nice to have another CB backup in case things go to shit.

51~~~
He's a decent player, very intelligent and composed. I don't know why it worries people so much he might play the odd game at CB. He'll do a good job there, left back or in midfield.

52~~~
Really shows where he stems from. His football intelligence is just top class, can play different positions without other special attributes. Good player to have.

As for him as CB, we should be absolutely dominant at possession to make it work in PL. Prefer him to Rojo there to be honest. I'm not sure we have better choices to play LCB at the moment. As we are really trying to adapt the possession football, Smalling and Jones are bit too clumsy for that role. But I think we need one CB for that cause, even if Blind seems decent is every position.

53~~~
My only concern is height and physicality. I think Blind is a great footballer, but he's 5ft11, not great in the air, nor the strongest in the challenge. I think he would struggle there in the Premier League unless it was a home game against relegation fodder, where we'd be expected to boss possession and give away few chances.

He's done well today, but Barca were never going to test us physically. He's great at anticipating the pass and stepping into interceptions. He's a good tackler as well. I wouldn't fancy him marking centre forwards when crosses come into the box though.

54~~~
Thought he was superb at centre back today, and I fully expect him to start there come the start the season. Only worry is how he'll deal with the aerial threat of the EPL.

55~~~
Solid and did well.

Still think LB (whether its cover or not) is where we will see him play more so long term.

56~~~
Did well. But I don't want to see him play there when the season starts.

57~~~
He had a decent game but his physical weakness will be a bigger issue in the PL and I also think he sticks his foot in, in the box too often.

58~~~
I thought he did well, aside from one flick at Suarez which on another day might have been a pen. But there are obviously far better options at cb

59~~~
He did very well up against Suarez who made it very difficult for us at times.

60~~~
If he played in arsenal, or pool he'd be one of their most important players. He's great.

61~~~
Tend to agree with this. His reading of the game from centre back was excellent yesterday but he will face a very different challenge in the Premier League. Whilst I think he could play centre back from Barcelona in Spain, in the Premier League he will be targeted with long ball up to target man.

62~~~
Played well but he will be targeted in the premier league and won't last long at cb if he does start the season there. Could work at home against teams who sit back but we would be very vulnerable to counter attacks because of his lack of pace and acceleration, away form home I think he will be a disaster.

63~~~
Agree entirely with this

He could work against certain strikers/teams, but teams with pace or physicality will target him. Even average strikers with pace would constantly look to run in behind him, and even average strikers with physical presence would attack him aerially. Some sides have strikers who could do both and Blind would be powerless to do anything about it.

64~~~
His partnership with Phil Jones is pretty much this.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/GPRanger/HanChewie.jpg" src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/GPRanger/HanChewie.jpg"/>

65~~~
So much for being 'torn apart' by Suarez. Great game and his reading of the game is spot on.

66~~~
He is a better player than most give him credit for.

67~~~
I want us to play Smalling and Jones and give them full trust to let them gain confidence and experience together. But facing Suarez with his physicality and Pedro with his brutal pace is about as hard that the EPL will get. Blind hardly made a mistake the entire game and looked better than Jones who himself did very well. 

The reason I don't want him to play is rather because his passing didn't seem to improve our build-up at all and if he just takes the easiest passing option all the time at the same intensity as Smalling/Jones then we may as well just play Smalling/Jones who are better defenders.

68~~~
Exactly my opinion.  Blind simply isn't build like a standard CB and if I had to choose between him and Rojo/Jones (assuming we don't get another player), I would pick Rojo/Jones because of their sturdiness and better aerial play.  Blind is more intelligent but against the mules that PL clubs use he would struggle.

69~~~
I think so too. He will be found out if played as a CB over the season. Him being picked because he's left footed would be very wrong. He's best as a LB

70~~~
I'm hoping he's just acting as a placeholder for the new CB, I think LvG wants a ball playing CB to partner Jones or Smalling long term and that will be what we are after in Ramos.

71~~~
Or Van Gaal just wants a player with good technique there and can use Blind there knowing that the defense is now shielded (Schneiderlin).

72~~~
He is not slower than Evans, neither less physical than him IMO.

What can be a problem though, is that he is quite short for a CB. Still Darmian and Shaw are quite tall for right/left back so maybe we would be fine in that aspect (they compensating for Blind's lack of height). If we don't sign a CB, I wouldn't be surprised if him and Rojo will fight for that left CB spot, with Smalling and Jones for the right CB spot. In fact, at home games I would prefer Blind to any of our CB considering that we want to play posession football and Blind rarely misplaces the passes. 

Now, imagine a Blind-Carrick partership at CB with Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Herrera and Mata in midfield. We'll outpass the other teams to death, make the game as much boring as all people watching the game will fall asleep.

73~~~
I think he'd soon find out that will be costly, the defense isn't suddenly surrounded by a force field, power and physicality are still important for a CB in the PL.

74~~~
If the goal is to have 70% posession in each game (and we manage to do so), then maybe we can afford our defense to be less physical. Or Jones compensate for Blind's lack of strength, while Blind compensates for Jones lack of brain. Now imagine what a player could be if we can merge those two.

75~~~
Rio Ferdinand

problem is if we have 70 something of the ball, where does the rest 30 go? long ball to strikers who is a physical type, shitstorm coming. I don't think Blind will play there much once Rojo is back, except injuries

76~~~
Agree. Although Jones can just decide to injure the other players when they'll go to get those long balls.

Anyway, against teams which lack physical strikers upfront, Blind can probably do a good job at CB. Or against Barca when we play them in UCL <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

77~~~
Yes, merged they'd be quite a player, but Blind will be a big target for any opposition we face given his lack of pace and physicality, I just can't see LvG going that route long term as he said himself about the lack of height and physical players on more than one occasion last season.

78~~~
Best thing about blind is he can play all across the left hand side. IMO we played him at CDM because he would protect our LCB spot when Rojo wasnt always on song.

Also,  he is still quite young; and could grow in to position.  People who worry about him at CB will have sleepless nights because:

A)  He might become our LCB
B)  there is a very few left footed CB's available &  trust me that is important in regards to fluidity.

Fantastic player.  Blind's utilisation & his intelligence is similar to Chess in terms of tactical planning.

79~~~
This.  Thats why the 352 hasn't gone away because aslong as Schneirdlin/carrick shield or cooperate with the CB's; things like hieght and strength are less important because we can have up to 5 defenders in defensive positions without any involvement of attacking players.

80~~~
I really liked him at cb. He is really nice at positioning himself.

81~~~
then you have to deal with the Benteke type of strikers

82~~~
He's been good, but I'll be furious if he has moved into the side at the expense of Mike. Well, not 'furious', per se, 'enraged' perhaps.

83~~~
I'm all for it. His old man had a pretty decent career there & he's shorter than Daley. There's plenty of other examples of players doing a job at CB despite not being physically typical (Bloody Gary Medel did a good job at the copa & WC). 
Darmian, Shaw & the other CB will all be quick enough & good enough in the air to compensate & it may complement those players to have Blind in there as well. 

If we're facing 25 crosses a game then it means the whole system has gone pete tong anyway. We could always sub him off if we're holding on & defending our own box.

84~~~
Blind and smalling would make a nice partnership.

85~~~
Some people want to leave blind out but his tactical displince is even better than carrick's IMO.  Having both on the field and not sacrificing a more fluid player in midfield is a big benefit; especially in UCL games.

86~~~
examples (purely for an analytic point of view)?

87~~~
If i understand the tactics correctly then we should have a maximum of 5 defenders in defensive situations.  Now blaming blind because he is not yet a regular CB is no different to blaming shaw or darmian for relative inexperience.  5 defenders mean we are arching towards quantity over quality and with quantity you definitely need a play of instructuonal understating like blind. 

This is still all hypothetical though; but i would not be suprised at all if rojo &  blind were rotating until say laporte is available (if needed at all).

88~~~
My words. At least worth a try.

89~~~
That's a pretty bold opinion to have. Even Blind's biggest fans often say his main weakness as a DM is his tendancy to move out of position.

90~~~
Carricj is a displined player dont get me wrong.  However blind is a player who knows EXCATLY what van gaal is talking about with regards to tactics.  The same with depay. Blind has grown up at ajax playing with these tactics.

91~~~
Its him moving out of position that shows me he has tactical awareness.  Thats why i said that i rekon that he started at DM to provide cover for Rojo or Jones; the latter being less able on his left hand side.

92~~~
I'm not sure how moving out of position and leaving your centre-backs (often badly) exposed shows tactical awareness. His tendancy to goal ball chasing every now and then would often land us in trouble.

93~~~
This is over cooked how long has Blind played under LVG? Blind is a clever player no doubt but he is very limited and his lack of pace is very obvious at times.

94~~~
Phase of Play, the Caf edition.

95~~~
don't know about most, but I have no problem seeing such a poster around<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

96~~~
since you list Depay, definitely as Dutch NT guys under him they can exactly understand what he's trying to express? so that makes the RvP case quite head-scratching

97~~~
The way I see it Smalling is the 3rd captain and biggest leader in our defence. He's played second halves so that we don't get destroyed with so many youngsters on the pitch. When the season starts he'll be first CB on the team sheet. 

When asked about Blind playing CB LVG has justified it by saying he likes a left footed CB. Everyone has overreacted and took it to mean he's now first choice. Don't think that's the case at all. People need to just relax

98~~~
I'm not sure if Memphis is fully up-to-date with van Gaal's methods. He's played under Rutten, Advocaat and Cocu- none of them play like van Gaal does. In his short spells at the NT I doubt he's learned it all which took our squad months (van Gaal said he couldn't possible explain it all as coach of the NT- so he just showed them Barcelona). It might be a bit easier for him since he's Dutch and an attacking player (less busy with defending/keeping possesion) but I'm sure van Persie knows van Gaal's style much better, Schweinsteiger probably does aswell.

Memphis wasn't bought for his 'knowledge of the philosophy', he's bought because he's one of the hottest young prospects and fills a spot in the team which needed strenghtening. Van Persie was let go because he's had alot of gametime, was on very big wages and still looked likely to be #2 behind Rooney as the striker next season even though he knew van Gaal's methods well I think. 

In that sense Blind is perfect, at Ajax he learned to play how van Gaal wants much better than he would've done at PSV.

99~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> What are your thoughts on Blind possibly being moved to a permanent LCB role?

100~~~
I don't think it will be permanent, in my eyes Blind can play the following positions:
CDM = LB > CB >>> CM

He's a great system player, he will rarely make big mistakes and usually does what van Gaal asks of him without moaning. In a possesion based team he's a great cog. He's not the highest quality player but he's able to slot into 3 (I really don't rate him as CM) positions without much trouble. I don't think that he will get a settled position yet this year, he's far too usefull for that.

The other reason why he played LCB is because van Gaal wants a ball playing CB there I think. He bought Rojo for that reason and Evans used to be pretty good at it who also played there, Blind is the only one on tour who's pretty good at this. I'm sure van Gaal knows the limitation of Blind, I doubt he'll play against Benteke at CB for example. Van Gaal experiments alot but isn't scared to stop if he sees it isn't working. I like Blind at CB for certain matches (where possesion/brain/passing > physicality) but I don't rate him as our starter CB yet. He might prove me wrong but for now I can't see it happening.

101~~~
I've always though he'd be a utility player here long term, I was just wondering if the fact our other CB's are poor on the ball and we look unlikely to get Ramos that he might end up as a regular fixture at CB this season. So do you see Rojo being a starter when fit this season?

102~~~
The CDM position is supposed to provide cover centrally; yet we didnt have a fully working defence for most of the season because rojo is not a offensively(passing)  capable on the left as smalling is on the right. This is the same if you compare jones to smalling and the latter is much more of a fluidly capable player. Especially when we played 3 at the back our weakest side was the left and as such it is my opinion that blind was utilised there to provide more cover on the left rather than carrick. 

We now have 2 superior DM's in carrick &  schneirdlin whk can focus their entire game on the central cavity.  What we then lack is what we have always lacked; a comfortable on the ball player on the left (who is predominantly left footed.)

103~~~
If Blind ever gets a starting position my bet is that would be as CDM, that's a position he can really grow into (he hasn't played there that long in his professional carreer) and that's where his lack of physical traits can be compensated for by his excellent positioning and passing. At LB/CB/CM he'll always be limitted.

I also don't think van Gaal would go into next season without a new CB, but since the market is scarce he might settle for Blind which won't be terrible. Wouldn't bet on it yet.

Not sure who of Rojo/Blind would get the nod over the other.

104~~~
I agree with <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> with saying that blind is the only ball playing defender on tour. 

I would go a bit further than him and say that rojo is not a ball playing defender in the way smalling is.  Rojo is much less capable &  even though he is the better central defender,  blind is/would/could be a better ball playing defender.

105~~~
I can only really see Blind operating as a CDM long term in the PL if we play with a double pivot at the base of midfield, as the point backwards midfield 3 exposes his lack of pace and physicality.

I'm certainly hoping we get a CB but with Ramos seemingly off and the Otamendi rumour fading I am not sure who he'd go for, unless there is some substance in the Stones rumours.

Damn, doesn't say much for Rojo.

106~~~
Just got the news Rojo's been fined too.  Looks like blind will be our LCB as the market is empty for left footers.  IMO ramos, otamendi & even stones are highly unlikely to be targeted by their preferred foot alone. 

It may seem like a little thing but when a right footed rcb and a left footed lcb play together; the space where the central DM has to operate is much more greater.  This expands our entire defensive line to 5 defenders with minimal space between players since only one player out the norm moves in to position. (CDM to CB).  

That way we revert in to a 3 at the back centrally while still having our fullbacks too.

107~~~
we seem not to play a lone pivot now though?

108~~~
Fined? Is this over the whole passport thing? As far as this whole RCB/LCB thing goes, all I can say is we managed for decades without such oddities under Fergie and Barca swept the board last year with two right footed CB's most of the time. I think starting Blind starting as our main CB based mainly off being left footed and a good passer is suicide, especially if he is partnered by Calamity Jones.

109~~~
LVG has made a career of things like this.. Blind as a cb could well be on the cards..

110~~~
Schweinsteiger is also in the bench.  I doubt we would pay so much for him if his role was to come from the bench.  One CDM and 2 box to box midfielders is what i heard van gaal say last season.

111~~~
Your on to something there because i think jones best partnership is with rojo.  2 bullies shielded with a passer like carrick.  If we play 2 ball playing defenders say like smalling &  blind then we need a more tenacious midfielder to cover them.

112~~~
Carrick Morgan Basti are conservative, Herrera has to slot in somewhere to connect to the advanced third. and doesn't he say he loves the point forward triangle?

113~~~
Smalling isn't a ball player though, he's probably our worst passer of the CB's we currently have. I think putting Jones and Rojo together is like having two wild dogs with no leash, too rash and reckless, both need a calmer head with them.

114~~~
Who do you think the best passer is then?  For me smalling is twice the passer kf the ball than rojo and jones combined. 

I think you have mistaken what i said because i also said Jones & rojo would only work with a CDM like carrick who plays with a calm head.  However,  if we have 2 calm CB's who pass in to space then what is required is not calmness but tenacity.

115~~~
1 CDM and 2 box to box is a pointed triangle; one attacking minded box to box like herrera and Schweinsteiger as the defensive minded box to box midfielder.  The midfield like the defence has to move around.  Absolutely no point herrera being in (for example)  sneidjers position when he could play at the heart of midfield; moving in to attack when necessary.

116~~~
I really can't see it myself. He has an excellent football mind but he doesn't have the physicality needed for a PL CB. Also I don't think he is very agile either, don't recall him being great winning headers. 

Perhaps he see's him as the ball playing CB we need? 

Also if he is trying him at CB then it suggests to me we won't be getting a CB this summer as we would be overloaded with CB options.

117~~~
Just anywhere but midfield.

118~~~
Rojo is the best, then Jones then Evans IMO.

The CDM isn't important in the partnership, you need a mix at CB regardless of who is playing as the DM.

119~~~
Cannavaro was one of the best, and he was 5'9.

120~~~
There are exceptions to every rule and Cannavaro was short but had a great leap, core strength and good speed, Blind has none of the latter attributes.

121~~~
Though we line up like this

Smalling - - Blind
       Schneiderlin

Take our defence like this:

Smalling-Schneirdlin-Blind

Blind occupies the left central areas while Smalling operates the right.  None of them are particularly partnering each other more so than partnering schneirdlin.

If not schneirdlin,  carrick is even more capable because he did the same role for us last year before his injury.

It's a 3rd CB thats only there; when needed.

It's the exact same principal of the false 9, a CF who becomes a CAM or ST depending on the defensive or attacking situation.

122~~~
thought he always prefers

<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a>

123~~~
His positioning at CB is bad so far.

Shaw is covering like 75% of the time for him. Especially on quick breaks he is loitering and has no pace to recover.

124~~~
Playing the false CB role in the first half.

125~~~
Not going to blame him. He's not a CB.

But our manager has to do his silly experiments. Hopefully he realises that it won't work soon like 3-5-2.

126~~~
Some lovely passing, if only that was the primary job of a CB.....

127~~~
Both goals come down Jones side yet Blind gets the blame.

128~~~
Catch his positioning for the first goal.

129~~~
You could say the same for darmian and Jones too

130~~~
Im not saying he is playing great I am saying our middle is soft. Carrick and BS probably shouldnt start too many games in the middle.

131~~~
Darmian not as much. Jones/Blind not getting much help from Carrick/BS. Shaw the best of the back 6

132~~~
And the second.

I'd take Evans over him every day of the week.

133~~~
Done ok, I'm sorry but Jones is clueless and zero football intelligence

134~~~
Matuidi ran away from Blind to the other side of Jones. I don't see how Blind can be expected to be there.

Blind could have been closer to Jones so that he could provide cover more quickly, but I still doubt it would have made much of a difference.

135~~~
Train wreck waiting to happen in the premier league but it's not his fault that LVG decides to play him instead of our best centre back, all because he's left footed. At first Van Gaal's little quirks were endearing but it's going to cost us big time in the league, just like it did last season.

136~~~
Likeable character but too much experiments with roles may cause him a football brain f*uck.

Play him where he was shining last season and he'll come as a useful player.

137~~~
He did ok I thought and played some nice incisive passes, he had to babysit Frankenjones at the same time so that made his job harder.

138~~~
Should be backup for left back.

139~~~
it was clear from the day one that he's bloody average at every position he "can" play. Would leave him as LB back up and that's about it

140~~~
He may not have been directly responsible for either goal tonight but he was nowhere to be seen for either goal and it was the same for the San Jose goal as well, the defence is supposed to work as a unit and he looked as if he was completely detached from the rest of the defence.He heads off into positions that he shouldnt be going into as a centre back and doesnt have either the panic button or the pace to get back into position. If he was playing brilliant passes and spreading the play to open up the game I'd understand the idea to a degree but he's playing short, safe passes that any of the other centre backs could play without any of the upside of having a natural defender. The cons far outweigh any pros of having him play there for me

141~~~
His problem today was that he went for players outside of his space.  A combination of jones and blind will struggle because both as a partnership don't know how to defend with patience.  

I still believe that smalling & Blind can work because both could defend up to the wider arches in defence meaning a DM like schneirdlin can act as the central pivot between 3 defenders & 2. 

Im not blaming jones for today either,  but its my opinion that out of the 3 central defensive players (rcb+lc+cdm); there wasnt a blance at all.

142~~~
Blind was fine. Jones was shit.

143~~~

144~~~
I dont see why he was playing CB. He is perfectly capable in his actual positions of DM and LB. Hes got no chance at CB when hes got someone like Jones next to him.

145~~~
LVG tried too hard to get him into the team.Should be benched if he isn't better than what we have at LB and DM.Simple.

146~~~

147~~~
Quizzed on Blind’s performance at centre-back, a position he has occupied all summer, van Gaal praised his fellow Dutchman but explained why his versatility could lead to him playing elsewhere.
<span style="font-size: 15px">
</span>

148~~~
He'll get found out in the premier league and then we'll learn from it. It might come off against Spurs, but against the regular physical premier league sides he'll have a miserable time IMO.

149~~~
Definitely it's just a question of how long LVG persists with it and how many points we drop because of it. For a cb he is slow, weak and small, he is also terrible when players are running at him at speed. It looks like he will start against spurs and they must be rubbing their hands together.

150~~~
Starting Blind as a LCB is a huge risk imo. I'd much rather have Rojo or Jones there than him. Daley reads the game well, but he lacks physicality and height to play as a CB. They play fast, direct and very physical football in EPL with a lot of crosses, so Bilnd may struggle. For now the jury is still out, and hopefully LvG gets it right, whatever that right may be.

151~~~
I am a huge fan of blind but putting him in centre half makes me think he is a van gaal lovechild or something and he is afraid to drop him.. he should be a back up centre midfielder/left back. 

Hopefully when rojo returns that is the left footed centre back choice..

152~~~
Kane will be pleased to see Blind starting.

153~~~
How many love children do people here think he has <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.First RvP,that theory got destroyed at the end of season,now guess is Blind`s turn.

154~~~
I don't think he reads the game very well. 

Where the hell was he for both goals? Even last season at CDM he pushed forward too much. 

His best attribute is his passing. He played a nice ball to Mata. I know it was offside, but was still a good pass. But defenders need to be able to defend firstly.

155~~~
From Ogden's piece today - 

'I was very pleased with Blind's performances, not only this against PSG, but in the other games too,” Van Gaal said. “I think he can build up the game better from that position and he has defended very well.

“I think I shall use him there, but also in midfield and the left-back position, but I'm pleased with his performances.

“So I think I shall play Shaw with Blind and Matteo Darmian and then the right central defenders position I have to consider.

'I am pleased with Darmian. As you can see, he can play left and right.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blind is clearly being blooded as an out and out utility player who can easily be deployed as a CB, CM, or LB. Can't really find any fault with his CB performances so far. He's been one of our better defenders alongside Darmian.

156~~~
He is overrating him big time imo. He will play him for a couple of games until he realizes he's not a CB at all. He should compete against Shaw for the LB position or back to Carrick / Schweinsteiger

157~~~
I know its pre season and doesnt matter but it amazes me how so many people ignore the fact that Blind was pulled at least 20 yards out of position for 3 of the 4 goals we conceded in pre season and could easily have conceded 2 penalties for diving in in the box yet people still talk about Jones getting dragged too far forward for the goal we conceded against West Brom last year and call Jones reckless for his tendency to dive in but praise Blind's composure and tactical awareness.

158~~~
The LB is Shaw's position, so Blind isn't going to play there unless Luke gets injured (which let's face it, is quite possible). Darmian is also capable of playing there. Blind is clearly being lined up as a utility player who can cover at 3 different positions.

159~~~
Blind is obviously inexperienced in that position. However that can change and he does have lots of defensive qualities that can be useful as a CH, particularly if placed next to someone who has the pace to cover him and also compete aerially.

Listening to LVG i'm pleased to hear he see's Blind in that position to help us build from the back, which is what we need to play an attacking style. 

Unlike Smalling and Jones, Blind is actually a capable passer who can get the ball into the feet of the midfield/attacking players quicker. Something we lacked last season and which stopped us from starting attacks far too often.

160~~~
His positioning can improve with experience though. He's an intelligent player, something you need as a defender and something I think we lack.

161~~~
He is an utility player but if he becomes a first choice CB (as LVG mentioned) then I feel we will have even bigger problems in our defense

162~~~
If he's going to insist on having Blind play CB, isn't having 2 of Carrick, Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger sitting so deep redundant? Blind is no slouch on the ball and doesn't need 2 midfielders within 5 feet of him at all times. Blind is more than capable of picking a forward pass on his own.

163~~~
i was at the gate last night in Chicago and would give his  CB performance a very mixed review. 

Pros- He has excellent composure on the ball and his passing is superior to any of our current cb's. 

Cons- Pretty much everything related to actual defending. His spatial awareness is poor. A couple times he stepped out to track Ibra when he dropped into midfield and left large gaps for midfield runners from PSG to exploit. As well his lack of height and pace is a major concern. I can't remember him winning any balls in the air and he struggled at times with PSG's pace in behind. Him and Jones did not seem to have a good understanding with each other and their skill sets don't complament each other either. 

All in all IMO the sooner Van Gaal drops this expirement the better as I don't think Daley can handle the physicality and pace of PL strikers.

164~~~
If he is good enough to become first choice then we likely have less, not more problems, as he will have outperformed the others.

165~~~
Big if for me. I don't see it mainly due to his lack of physicality - he would struggle in the EPL imo

166~~~
He's going to get absolutely destroyed at centre back in the PL. He struggled in midfield against strong pacy players, so God knows what he'll be like at the back. 

Genuinely, no other team in the top 10 would swap their starting centre backs for Blind.

167~~~
I think it'll largely depend on who we're against. He'll be fine in games where the opposition doesn't pose much of a threat and we're okay to pass it out from the back without too much difficulty, but he'll struggle against more powerful, dominant players who can beat him in the air. I don't imagine he'll be LVG's long-term solution at CB, though. He's probably just more of a utility option to play there when needed to, since he's fairly versatile.

168~~~
Basically he'll be fine if we play against teams with slow, weak, short strikers, other than that he's a big bloody pork leg in the water for the Sharks.

169~~~
I suppose there's consolation that if he gets absolutely embarrassed by the PL's strikers then LVG will surely drop him. As mad as he seems, he's not going to be as stupid enough to keep selecting him if he's getting turnt week in week out.

170~~~
I know it is hindsight from the PSG game, but even before that I have never thought he would make a good centre-back. He is a natural at performing his defensive duties, but if his lack of physicality was an issue for him to be regarded as a first-choice midfielder, then how could he possibly play centre-back? It could probably work against a team like Spurs, or Arsenal (when Giroud isn't on), but any other team in the Premier League would have their CF ruin him. It's not even to do with his height (there are many short players who have excelled at CB, see Cannavaro) - he is simply too easy to bully. He has no pace at all, and has also showed little aerial ability. 

I'm not criticising Blind, but more Van Gaal. Blind is an excellent player to have - he won POTY playing as the #6 for Ajax, and his combination with Young, when he played left-back, contributed to our best run of last season. It is clear to see he is not a real centre-back, though. All that having been said, I do think that playing him at LCB will benefit us massively in the moments where we are chasing a game, with the opponents pressed back in their own half. Because of LVG's possession style (that sees the other team without the ball and penned back for most of the game), having a centre-back (and more-so in our case, a left-footed one) that can pass the ball will make a difference. I don't think it's essential, and I feel that being able to defend is the #1 priority for our CBs (as we cannot afford such luxuries against better teams), but he may improve in this position. I think he will have his uses at CB, but the idea of him being a first-choice central defender scares me a little bit.

171~~~
Does that even exist?

172~~~
Well it took him half the season to realise the 3-5-2 and shoehorning Rooney/RVP/Falcao in the team wasn't working, so lets see how long it takes him to work this one out. Probably at least 3 months.

173~~~
Not in the PL.

174~~~
Exactly.

As much as I think LvG is occasionally nuts I do think Blind could be a good solution against only the weaker opposition. This season the defence will be well shielded with Two defensive midfielders. The weaker teams will generally come to defend. I suppose it does make sense to go with a ball player who could add numbers in midfield whilst midfielders ghost into the opposition Third.

175~~~
Ideally we need to buy a defender who can play out of the defence. This was the reason why we were linked with Hummels and Ramos who have both these attributes.

176~~~
We all wanted a new centre back and we've ended up with Blind <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think anyone suggesting this last season would have been laughed off here so I don't see any value in trying to rationalise the decision. Hopefully he's just testing his ability to cover that position and Rojo will be assuming the role very quickly. 

I like Blind but I can't see him securing a position for himself, he's a bloody good utility player though

177~~~
Pretty certain thats it. Smalling he knows is up to the job. Jones he wanted to see more of. Rojo couldn't play pre-season and Jones is right footed so Blind was the only real option to go in at LCB.

Looking at the Audi Cup when LVG first started at Bayern he was playing people all over the place in pre season. It's obviously his thing.

178~~~
So those of you who've watched Bayern..Has he always had a left-footed LCB?

179~~~
Badstuber

180~~~
Badstuber played at LB in van Gaal's first season at Bayern I think.

181~~~
I wonder why Blind seems to play with much more energy when at LB or CB than when playing in midfield. Also he tends to pass better and have a bigger drive moving forward from the back. He should do that in midfield. Yet when he plays in midfield he to often plays like he wants everyone to fall asleep or something.

182~~~
Hasn't he mentioned that he only does exactly what LvG tells him to do? He's not supposed to take a single risk while playing in midfield, it seems.

183~~~
Correct

184~~~
I doubt that Blind has been getting big praises from LVG all season and then LVG buys Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger and moves Blind out of midfield. But maybe you are right. Find it very weird that the same player shows so much less energy in midfield than when he plays in defense. Especially because his strengths better suit playing in midfield.

185~~~
He hasn't played much in midfield in his professional carreer. He played there at times in his youth, but broke trough as a left back. Only in his last season at Ajax did he play as a midfielder, he took a little while to adapt but was generally good there. For us he barely started half his games there so he's not the most experienced midfielder, I actually think it's his best position if he develops more. He has the attributes as he's a smart defender and also has a good pass in him, if only he used it a bit more.

186~~~
I don't mind Blind as an option against the weaker teams, much like we have used Carrick at CB in the past (although mostly due to injuries), but he shouldn't be starting the majority of games there.

187~~~
I agree, but LvG doesn't seem to see things the same way. He clearly loves Blind and seems to want to shoehorn him into the team as much as possible, even if it means playing him out of position.

Actually I'm not even sure what his best position is, I guess his best form last season was at left-back?

188~~~
This thread is likely to be the most active for our first 5 games odd.

189~~~
From what ive seen of him i still think he is best in midfield, even taking into account the WC and playing next to Young at LB. He got left completely high and dry at times last season as team mates abandoned their positions, otherwise he looked very capable there.

Hes one of the names that causes no worry whatsoever when I see him on the teamsheet.

190~~~
Shouldn't Shaw and Blind be competing for LB spot rather than Shaw getting a permanent spot?

191~~~
I think they will be, but there weren't many times when they were and Carrick were all fit, so often times when Shaw was fit Blind was already needed in DM. That's where Blind will be fighting for this season imo, and he is a more than adequate backup if he ends up losing that competition. 

I'm not sold he will ever be a United quality central midfielder - he looks a bit too cautious on the ball and the game looks too quick for him at times. Mind you, those words could've been (and were, loudly) spoken about a certain Mr Carrick a few years ago, and look how important he became for us. There's also the possibility that he is much more comfortable playing as part of a holding two, rather than being responsible for holding on his own; we've certainly had worse CM duos than Blind and Schweinsteiger or Blind and Schneiderlin over the years!

192~~~
I honestly think he's one of the best footballers in the squad. His first touch is great, he can pass and he can defend. It's no wonder LVG wants to shoehorn him into the team.

193~~~
But he is no CB. Anyhow, I can see LVG starting him on Saturday

194~~~
The only way he could ever work as a CB would be in a three-man central defence, protected by two better defenders, with prime job to distribute the ball which would virtually mean that he'd still be a defensive midfielder more than a center half. He's not shown anything to prove that he could be a good center half, in fact he's been mostly disappointing whenever he played there. He was very good last season and he's one of my favourite new players here but I don't think trying to find him a position he's not that familiar with and frankly not good enough at is the best way to accomodate him in the team.

195~~~
He's being shoehorned into the team

196~~~
Struggling to see the reasoning behind signing him and Rojo last season - the latter was for an extortionate amount of money aswell when you add in the Nani loan and wages we paid. Niether of them are good enough for the positions we bought them in just 12 months down the line. Blind is okay back up for CM and LB but Rojo hasn't cemented himself at centre back at all, so much so we're already desperate for a new CB to play with Smalling or Jones and at £25+mill we spent on getting him here it looks like a complete waste. Would be just as happy Evans playing instead of him, he doesn't look much better in my opinion. Hoping time will prove me wrong.

197~~~
Blind was absolutely vital at the start of last season. Carrick was injured, Fletcher couldn't reproduce his preseason form and Blind covered for the LB and CDM spot well, he was one of the few players who didn't need much adapting to van Gaal but only to the league. He kept things ticking whilst our centrebacks were struggling to bring the ball out of the defence and our midfield struggled to keep possesion. He got loads of praise on here untill he got injured and rushed back because we needed him, after that his performances dropped a bit as he seemed tired and the team around him got better.

He's a player who can cover for 2 positions without much trouble and centreback too. The Dutch league player of the year and not very expensive who did well for us, why shouldn't we have signed him? We needed a midfielder and as last season showed we needed a leftback and centreback too because of injuries, Blind really helped with his versatality and I'm sure he will continue to do so.

198~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Excellently put, I completely agree. Carrick has generally been awful at CB for us and Blind is a shorter, weaker, less talented clone of him. As an emergency option, as in like 5th choice then he'd be fine. Can't see how he'd be anything like as useful as is in CDM or LB

199~~~
Maybe this is some sort of strategy where in possession we end up playing a back 3 again.  blind moves to the left as shaw pushes on almost as a lwb and carrick/schweinsteiger moves into the middle almost like a CB. So you have Smalling/Jones - Carrick- Blind back 3 in possession. It would be risky to play that against big teams especially if we get pick pocketed in midfield

Edit- Or maybe its a move to still play 4-4-2 but in possession helping shaw and darmian (esp shaw) play further up the pitch. Lvg seems to trust blinds passing over any other CB which is a shame.

200~~~
They'll be a meltdown on here if Blind has a good game on Saturday. Yes, a good game. That is assuming he'll start at centre back, of course.

201~~~
He has none of the physical qualities you would want in a CB. He is a good midfielder though. This left footed, right footed CB nonsense means he is now our starting CB(at least until Rojo returns).

202~~~
Looking at our early schedule, I would say only Arsenal, Newcastle and Sunderland in the first 8 games are reasonably likely not to pick a giant target man or pace merchant who can bully or outrun Blind:

Spurs - Kane - Power, some pace
Villa - Gestede is very strong, not sure how mobile he is
Newcastle - Mitrovic (power) Cisse (neither), Perez (Pace) 
Swansea - Gomis is tall and strong, Eder is very strong 
Liverpool - Benteke is powerful
Southampton - Pelle is too tall and strong for Blind and Mane too quick
Sunderland - Defoe isn't quick anymore
Arsenal - Giroud probably too big and strong, Walcott too fast

In some ways,  Villa away is the most concerning since you'd fancy Smalling-Jones to handle Gestede fine but he may win a bunch of headers against Blind to create trouble. Swansea away you'd fancy them to get some crosses in to their big 9s, too, since they are good enough to have the ball against us.

203~~~
I worry about Blind's positioning too, since he has so little experience at CB or with Smalling/Jones. On the tour, I forget against who, the 9 was coming towards the ball centrally about 30 yards from goal and the entire left-side was open and someone got played in.

Right now, I have to wonder why Van Gaal sanctioned spending on Schneiderlin instead of an LCB, as Schweinsteiger, Carrick and Blind all look solid options at DM, but Blind is about to start the season at LCB, which anyone can see is a disaster.

204~~~
It was the right move to buy Schneiderlin, we just need a CB too, simple as. It is not like we dont have money, more that we want Ramos or no one.

205~~~
He's got the offside trap wrong at least a couple of times in each game this preseason. I'm sure he'll learn eventually, but that's going to be a weakness for us in the next few weeks.

206~~~
I have no clue why we are trying to convert him into the Dutch John O'Shea. 

He had no experience in playing for a top club at CB and he didn't convince even in the friendlies. It is is really weird that a club of our size and stature have been playing players out of position for years in spite of spending significantly in the last 5 years.

207~~~
I agree. The way things are going LvG might as well play total football next season with Jones taking corners, Mata as a false CB with Blind as his CB partner.

208~~~
Pretty useless today, defensively a passenger and he offered nothing in terms of his passing to justify being selected there. Fewer games he plays as a cb the better.

209~~~
Yep. Smalling was a one man central defence. Thankfully the full backs were good and Spurs did very little going forward. The idea that this is almost certain to cost us points frustrates the life out of me. It's just so needless.

210~~~
What is LVG thinking it's absolutely baffling.

211~~~
Blind's presence at the back is very good when we have possession. He allows us to not crumble when pressed, which we are so used to seeing. Great under pressure and good recycling of the ball with short passes. 

As an actual defender though, he was brushed aside with ease on a few occasions. Against big lump centre forwards, he is going to get hammered. It can't be a long term solution, surely.

212~~~
He should never play CB again. Not even in FIFA. It is really embarrassing for everyone involved.

213~~~
Wish we'd just stop this experiment. Baffling.

214~~~
He can't play CB, really can't see what LVG sees in him even if he's left footed. He was shaky and Smalling had to mop for him, don't think he has the right physique.

215~~~
LVG has really made a hash of this. If Blind is a CB in his eyes, then why didn't he play him there last year, even when we were in the midst of a crippling CB injury crisis? He's a very good player, but a CB he is not. I'd rather play Jones with Smalling (who gives a flying one about having a left-footed player there?) Perhaps Rojo could be the one to partner Smalling (who was immense, and really should have been starting throughout the preseason.)

216~~~
He can't win headers. Positioning not great. Not the quickest and strongest. 

I'd rather have Carrick as CB.

217~~~
I think we need to be able to defend much better as a team if we're going to keep playing blind centre back. Barca have been plenty successful using Mascherano at centre back, but they defend all over the pitch, which means teams can't exploit him easily and have to take what they are given instead.

218~~~
Agree totally. Blind won't be able to play there for the full season.

219~~~
Mascherano is better positioning wise and defensively than Blind. 

Even at CDM, Blind has not been convincing.

220~~~
Smalling was absolutely immense which covered him.

I'm not sure I want to see how long we'll persist with this.

221~~~
Rojo will replace him when fit everyone chill out

222~~~
To be honest I think the majority of you had already decided he was shit today before the match had even started.

He was hardly terrible today, didn't stand out but a defender not being noticed isn't necessarily a bad thing. Having said that I didn't exactly see the benefit of playing him over a CB, it's surely a matter of time before he's exposed for not having the skill set to play as a centre back.

223~~~
It will cost us points if we persist with him at centre back. The only times Kane won any duels today was when he got to take Blind on. He's slow and weak, and while he has other qualities, I struggle to see how he's going to be good enough keeping the first two in mind.

224~~~
Wasnt that bad, but not good enough to start the next match there. Rojo, Jones and even Evans are just better options.

225~~~
I thought he wasn't actually bad.

226~~~
He was poor he just got away with it today, committed himself too easily, beaten in the air too often, out of position, held off and out muscled and too slow.

227~~~
He's a very intelligent player, who reads the game very well and has good positioning, but he's too weak for a CB and loses almost every aerial battle, which is bound to cost us dearly if we persist with him. The last minutes when Spurs were hoofing the ball were very tense.

228~~~
Not good enough for CB, Jones or Rojo should come in for him next game.

229~~~
Pochettino missed a trick by not putting Kane on him and hitting some balls up to him as Blind is no good shoulder to shoulder. He uses the ball nicely but so far IMO he looks a good LB and should mainly be back up to Shaw. Was fortunate on a couple of occasions that Smalling was so alert and covered his grass.

230~~~
I really rated Blind at times last season, but as everyone has said he is not a CB. He is also not a better CDM than Carrick, Basti or Schneiderlin, nor is he as good a LB as Lukey Shaw. He is a good utility player to have, especially off of the bench, but not a starter.

231~~~
LvG seems to like him but he seems like he's destined for a season on the bench, all things being equal. Which they never are.

232~~~
He wasn't the problem, but neither did his passing make any difference in attack.

233~~~
I don't know how we would've coped without his ball playing at the back. I mean, is there seriously another CB at the club who could pass the ball sideways, get it back and then lay it off absolutely perfectly for the goalkeeper to punt it out long?

234~~~
I like him enough as a player but the thought of him at centre back does make me nervous.  This left foot obsession of van Gaal's is ridiculous.

235~~~
You think it's easy but remember Valencia knocking us out of the FA Cup!

236~~~
He's clearly only there until Rojo is up to fitness. Jones was terrible in pre season and is allocated to the right side, whilst Evans is just a liability. There is noone else.

237~~~
I thought his passing was rubbish today... worse then Smalling's in fact.

238~~~
Did fairly well today actually. But will get found out eventually I think. That Spurs move where it was wrongly called offside...Blind was so hilariously out of position for that one. Reminded me of that PSG game again.

I think Smalling had the most number of passes for anyone on the pitch.

239~~~
I think you're right about Rojo

240~~~
We got a clean sheet guys. Blind was fine! Sometimes I feel you guys exaggerate just to justify your previous comments

241~~~
What's funny about this, bar smalling he is actually our best centerback. Although I rate rojo, and believe hé has more to offer

242~~~
Said at the start it would take 5 games for Van Gaal to realise this.

243~~~
If you really believe this, you have no idea about football. Smalling did the dirty work and the easy on the eye stuff, but the amount of times blind prevented opportunities simply by his positioning and composure on the ball has to be given credit for. I for one was totally against the decision to put him there but for today at least, it worked out well. I think Smalling/ Blind is actually a very good pairing since they both cover up each others weaknesses very well. Smalling is your typical old fashioned, physical centre back who acts as a stopper where blind is much more intelligent and reads the game very well so essentially he stops a lot of opportunities before they reach Smalling in the first place. There's a lot more that goes on in defending than simply tackling/being able to keep up with the oppositions attacker. Both Smalling/Jones and Smalling/Rojo lack enough brain power to make a successful pairing IMO. The defensive ability(well I'm not so sure about Jones) is there but they are all lacking in ability to read the game, which is perhaps blinds biggest strength and hence why it tends to go unnoticed.

Then again, as another poster above mentioned, why not play Carrick there if that's the issue?

244~~~
I have a soft spot for Blind but he isn't a starting centre back.

He will be vital for us this season and I hope he'll be with us for a while. There aren't many players around that has the intelligence and versatility that he does. He'll have a big impact this season.

245~~~
This thread is a joke.  Wait until he has a game that costs us before you lot start thinking you guys are better managers than Louis effing van gaal.

246~~~
Jesus people are clowns.

Blind has the best reading of the game and anticipation of any defender we have and maybe any in the league. I have my own doubts about seeing him come up against a Costa/Benteke/Crouch type but lets leave out the criticism until there is any actually warranted. He had a fine game today against a couple of cracking players in Eriksen and Kane who I thought both looked sharp.

247~~~
Had a good game opposite to the prevailing belief.

248~~~
I think most people criticising him are just determined to prove themselves right after bashing LVG for the past 3 weeks. They will always love a good moan! This is coming from someone who was also quite strongly against the decision of playing him there. However I always stated that I felt that the manager had a good reason to put him there and so far he hasn't done anything to show otherwise. Can easily see him becoming our new scapegoat and the apparent reason the whole team decide not to play well(according to the ever knowledgeable football experts on here) with the first real mistake/ below average game he has however <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

He was good today. No more and no less. If anyone should be criticised today, it's our attacking players, and well, Valencia.

249~~~
Leave Daley alone! <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

250~~~
Daley won't make people happy as long as his position on FIFA/FM is not written as CB. The comments that he isn't a CB are quite funny in some way. I mean why we should judge people on their performances after all.

I think he did very well today, as he did in pre-season. Hopefully we'll continue this partnership, IMO it is the best we have. Would prefer Blind instead of Jones/Evans there every day of the week. We'll see how Rojo will do for us but Blind is complementing Smalling well, is cold as feck, good at passing and reading the game. People moaned before the match how Kane will completely dominate him in the air. That didn't happen after all, yet people still find something to moan.

251~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, I was incredulous when I first heard he was playing there in preseason. Had a good laugh about it in the pub with the lads. But let's watch the game and call it as it actually happens rather than decide what you're going to post before the game.

Blind was very good today. I remember him making one real mistake which he atoned for immediately and several excellent touches or interceptions.

252~~~
Completely agree mate, and this is what I have posted numerous times on the forum only to be met with a lot of angry responses. Can't please everyone I guess.

253~~~
Good on the ball, seemed to lose every 50/50, get muscled out a lot, and win no headers.

He's just not a centre back.

254~~~
Great versatility from Blind.

255~~~
'Ofcourse there will be moments that a striker will win a duel vs me. But it's not all about strength, it's about being smart. Nothing negative about Vertonghen or Alderweireld (1,89 & 1,85 vs Blind at 1,82) but they kept losing duels to Rooney too. The match was a chess game, when Tottenham had the ball we stayed in our (defensive) shape well. We forced them into making mistakes and that also led to the 1-0. We did very well and didn't give away chances untill the end of the game.'

Blind post match interview, probably translated from English to Dutch and then back to English again by me <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

256~~~
When did it happen against Spurs?

257~~~
Thought he played well today really, didn't look troubled at all. Just had that one pass which could have troubled us, but that had nothing to do with him as a CB point of view, that was just a bad pass. Didn't seem to have any trouble coping with the physicality or anything, as we had Smalling next to him who is a tank physically so it evens out. I do think Rojo will be starting once he gets fit enough, but Blind is definitely a decent option to have, better then Blackett and McNair for that position probably.

258~~~
His reading of the game was excellent.

259~~~
Some awful crap being posted here. Not wanting Blind at CB is not about having an agenda or wanting to criticise. It's simply about understanding what's required for the position. Blind is simply too slow and too weak to play CB in the premier league. I also don't agree that he positional sense is good for a CB. He seems to me to get caught out of position a lot. It's no coincidence that the majority of our clearances and interceptions were made by Smalling because he was the one reading the game and getting into the right positions. Blind was just noticeable for the amount of 50/50s he lost.

The idea that we need him for his ability on the ball doesn't make much sense either. With Carrick and Schneiderlin in front of the defence we have enough to start attacks from deep. All we need right now is another CB who can defend. That would give us a solid back four with good midfield cover in front of it. We'd be in great shape. Playing Blind just gives the opposition an obvious weakness to target.

260~~~
I dont remember him being caught out of position once and Smalling cleared what was in fron of him. When there was danger on Blind's side he dealt with it.

261~~~
A few times in the first half when it was a bit scrappy.

262~~~
You're sure you're talking for today's match?

263~~~
Same here. Despite the hysteria.

264~~~
Yeah, there was a couple of times in the first half where it got a bit congested and Blind seemed to get shoved out of it a bit, mainly by Kane iirc.

It wasn't a major issue, but it just highlights that he's physically vulnerable.

265~~~
I just genuinely can't remember it. I think that Kane put the ball once between his legs but that's it. I just don't think that he lost many (any) 50-50 today, neither got outmuscled. He has fantastic positioning and usually is much nearer the ball then the opponents.

Him and Smalling might create a decent partnership IMO. Both very intelligent players with good positioning ability, and good at reading the game.

266~~~
He got away with a couple today. Thought he played well overall just needs to stop take chances, especially when he's the last man. His reading of the game is excellent but he will struggle against a powerful forward.

267~~~
I don't like Blind at CB because I don't feel he's suited to be in last man situations defensively, in particular against quick, technical teams, but he's playing because Rojo has only started training with the team once they returned from the US.  Whether we agree or not, LVG has been consistent in his need to have a left footed LCB for distribution reasons and nobody else is capable of that in the current team.  Once LVG feels Rojo's fitness is adequate and assuming Blind continues to put in mediocre type performances I will be surprised if Rojo doesn't come in for him. 

Also I don't particularly care for Blind at CB, but he wasn't terrible today.  To me he just looked like Carrick looks when he plays in the back.  Those players' defensive capabilities are much better suited to shielding the back four rather than being at the heart of it.  They can do a job there at times, but week in and week out in that position is not something we should ever want to see.

268~~~
If i remember correctly - van Gaal played Blind senior in defence when he was Ajax coach in 94  - he wants one CB to be able to join midfield as a deep lying playmaker while in possession. In think this is what he has in mind for Blind junior as well... In noticed him playing some well timed through passes today but generally speaking did not offer enough (yet) in build up/attack to make up for his lack of strenght and speed... Against more agile strikers (aguero) we need other options at the back but might still use him as deep lying midfielder (if carrick is injured)

269~~~
He was good today without being tested too much. He reads the game and tackles well which is probably enough against Kane. Against someone with more speed or power and he'll struggle at CB in all likelihood

270~~~
That is a very, very bold statement (and not just because I made it bold).

271~~~
Smalling read the game much better yesterday and I think there are plenty of centre halves who read the game better than blind. Clearly he is an intelligent player but I think it's a massive exaggeration to make that statement.

A better point is he is one of the smallest, slowest and weakest centre halves who started in the league this weekend, whether or not he and rest of defence can compensate for that will define if he is a success or failure.

272~~~
Had an average game. His passing was more often than not shit for someone playing there because of that quality. He didnt do a lot of mistakes, but he is slow and weak. I dont understand how some say he is a good CB.

He has qualities that make him a good player and even a very good CB, if you just ignore the other things needed. But the basic things he just doesnt have to play that position regularly in the PL. 

He doesnt bring the team up, we have to drag him through games. He massively hinders our performances, because he always needs someone watching his back and trying to solve the situation for him. It is like van Gaal just plays him there to strengthen our team work and learning how everybody should compensate and help each other out.

273~~~
Michael Carrick is better than him in that aspect.

274~~~
As is, for example, John Terry. What an absurd statement.

275~~~
Great squad player! Not a regular starter if winning trophies.

276~~~
I prefer him over Jones in games against weaker sides. But yes his lack of pace is worrying in this position...

277~~~
He is much more an comfortable in possession than either Jones or Smalling, especially the latter is who is awkward on the ball and cant pass for shit.

However when Rojo is fit and ready I expect him to displace Blind in this role.

278~~~
Was fine vs Spurs. 

But playing him as a first choice CB will mean trouble down the line.

279~~~
Looked decent enough to me and was nice to have somebody in defence who could deal with the ball under pressure. I heard Owen saying before the game if I was Kane i'd just go and stand next to Blind and tell people to play high balls up to me. This was the only thing that worried me as it did against PSG the chance of Blind v Ibrahimovic. He didn't ever seem to get exposed really though so if he can come through games against these two he'll do ok.

280~~~
What a nonsensical argument! So unless he makes a mistake that costs his team the game people can't have an opinion that he shouldn't play there? But for an incorrect offside flag he could have cost them a goal when he was brushed off the ball ridiculously easily after stepping into midfield. Dembele would have been clean through.

His issues with physicality were obvious in the Spurs game. Just because it didn't prove costly in that game doesn't mean it won't in a future game.

I really like Blind. He's an intelligent player who plays to a good level in a number of positions. But he has physical limitations and should never be a first choice centre back at a club like United.

281~~~
You can have an opinion all you like but the managers decision is final and it has yet to bite us in the face.  Not even a single goal never mind costing us a game.  

Blind has every chance of failing horrendously as he does succeeding.

282~~~
Blind's performances at CB shouldn't be overly scrutinised in my opinion as he was never brought to play that position as is only doing so because the manager has asked him too.

283~~~
Good defender. He'd probably be #1 first choice if we played 5-3-2. He'll contribute a lot over the years BUT I'm almost certain LvG will use Rojo in the back once he's fit.

284~~~
Bold but definitely possible. His interception stats are great. Most interceptions in the oppositions half in all of Europe last season.

285~~~
I would give it a try against teams that have no interest in attacking us. He will make the play more fluid. Not a solution against top teams though.

286~~~
Villa will be a big test for him, think he will be targeted by their forwards, they have a lot of pace up front and will play on the break.

287~~~
Seconded. A realy big test for Blind. Will not blame him if he loses aerial duels, as he can not jump over nature and physiology. Hopefully, LvG knows what he is doing...

288~~~
in the games at home v teams we'll have 90% of the ball against it makes great sense. in effect have an extra midfielder with much more ability on the ball than any of our centre backs.

but against teams with even the vaguest pace/height, it could go very wrong.
The idea of playing Jones instead of Smalling, losing a chunk of height and pace in one fell swoop was a very worrying sign, that we got away with through Jonesy's latest setback

289~~~
As much as Sherwood and Wilkins are stupid. Their planning all this week will be to get Gestede on Blind at all times and get runners off him when he wins every header.

290~~~
I hope it doesn't up being like when Fellaini destroyed Carrick at CB all those years ago. Considering Carrick is bigger and stronger than Blind it doesn't look too promising. 

What happened to Rojo? Injured?

291~~~
fecked up his traveling after the Copa America and hasn't played a match since the final. He won't be fit after his break.

292~~~
Doesn't bring me much confidence facing Gestede.

293~~~
Smalling will deal with him. Stay Calm and trust in mike!

294~~~
I agree. I'd start Jones, who is dumber than Blind but stronger in the air.

I got beat in the air for a goal today by a giant striker. There's just not that much you can do when the cross is hit correctly. Gestede is 6'4 and leaps well. Blind is 5'10 or so and not a great athlete. Jones isn't Vidic aerially, but he's solid enough.

295~~~
Jones is injured.

296~~~
he's not injured technically

297~~~
I dont think we got away with anything. LVG was just playing Jones with Blind in pre season to see if he could do it, and he couldn't. Im willing to bet Smalling is now permanently ahead of Jones in the pecking order. The injury had nothing to do with it.

298~~~
I think it would be too risky to play Blind at CB in many matches. It is just a disaster waiting to happen.

299~~~
Not convinced he's centre back material.Gave the ball away and seems to slow and weak for center back.

300~~~
If LVG plays Blind at CB for the next while, I might just lose my mind. He was ok against Spurs, but got found out a bit too much.
He's too short, slow and weak to play there.

301~~~
Wouldn't a normal experienced CB (not star names like Ramos or Otamendi or Hummels) do a better job than Blind? Why play a handicapped match at all? Unless of course Blind offers something much more that we could afford to play him there.

302~~~
Hes left footed. 

I win.

303~~~
Point is Mike would have been dropped of.Jones was fit.

304~~~
After PSG game LVG said Darmian, Shaw and Blind are certain so Jones would be dropped even if he was fit.

305~~~
Instead.of practice, daley blind needs them be in the weight room almost every day.

306~~~
And on some sort of growth machine. Can we make him 2 inches taller?

307~~~
I can have an opinion? How very magnanimous of you.

You are absolutely right. Blind has played one game at centre back and although he made mistakes, was overpowered physically and was comfortably beaten in the air, none of those instances happened to lead to a goal so let's keep playing him there until they do.

308~~~
When? Any of those lead to a dangerous situation?

As for aerial duels, yea, he lost one and that was only aerial duel he went in because there was no need for it, Smalling was clearing everything.

309~~~
Why was he cosplaying Andy Carroll? People these days...

310~~~
I thought he did well tbh. If this experiment works then LVG deserves a lot of credit.

311~~~
The same was said about Kane. But I think it's a fair concern.

312~~~
Tottenham do play fairly decent football, they have more methods to break a team than crossing to Kane.

However, with all due respect to Villa, we've seen it last season with Benteke and it looked the same when Gestede was on. They're going to be heavy on the aerial threat. Somewhat wish Fellaini wasn't banned for this one and could be set on a man marking job on him.

This for me of all games isn't a match for Daley Blind at center back but hopefully he helps us keep a lot of the ball. Don't get me wrong, it's not only a concern on him but I hope Romero or whoever is in goal is very comfortable catching swirling crosses.

But yes, I believe in Mike.

313~~~
He has also played at CB under van gaal for the Netherlands.  Thanks for your input.

314~~~
Gestede is a boss  in the air,  the only centreback who'll be able to beat him arieally  is Smalling.  Blind might actually be the smart choice here as he's most likely to read the flick on.

315~~~
Taller than Franco Baresi, Bobby Moore, Martin Buchan and a few other great CBs

316~~~
well we can't prove it, but seeing as though the exact team that started on sat was trialled in the last friendly, bar Smalling I'd say it was pretty likely Jones was starting until being ruled out.

317~~~
No way man.  The pre-season was all about getting players used to playing in their new/unusual positions. I'm sure van gaal considers smalling as his number 1 defender and as such played jones as much as he could to build his fitness.  

The same goes for mata playing at RW,  januzaj as a striker, Rooney as our only legitimate centre forward etc.  These players needed much more of a pre-season than smalling did in his natural position.

318~~~
Given that Jones is out and Rojo isn't match fit, the only other choice is Blackett. its inevitable that Blind will play.

319~~~
Hes not doing anything wrong, I say keep him there until then.

320~~~
Also, I'm sure gaal does and says things just to keep players competitive amongst themselves.

Evans, rojo needs to step it up now blind I'd there. In regards to Jones getting the nod in pre season, and his comments suggesting he's uncertain who his best rcb is, I think he's just keeping Mike on his toes.

321~~~
When Caf decides something (like Blind being shit at CB even before he played there) facts won't matter and opinions won't change.

Caf would have refused Baresi, Ayala, Cannavaro and Moore cause they were too short.

322~~~
Like someone said, opinions have been formed and they will stay that way. Unless you are a big facker, you cant be a PL defender apparently.

323~~~
Come off of it all of those guys spent most of their careers at CB and had the quickness, aerial ability and strength to make up for their lack of height. This is probably a non issue since Blind is probably just a placeholder until Rojo is fit to play and with Jones suffering from illness it is not like we have any other options. But, it is silly to just ignore that Blind just does not look like a suitable CB. He has none of the important physical qualities you would look for in a CB. Really find me a top CB who isn't quick, who isn't strong and is not effective in the air? Most top CBs have at least two of those qualities. Best case Blind can be as good of a CB as Carrick or Busquets.

324~~~
Even if he is a place holder; lets say the guy makes no mistakes for 5 games.  Then rojo comes in and leakes goals; would you play rojo or blind?

Furthermore how can you call blind not quick?  You do realise he played at LB for us and wasnt quick for us for a LB but as a CB he is effing rapid compared to most.

325~~~
Wouldn't that be dangerous? Unless we are forced, should we play a player in an unnatural position.
I know that he played in a 3 man defense for Netherlands, but it is not the same.

326~~~
Why not?  Did you not see carrick dropping in as the central CB inbetween blind & smalling whenever they spread out wider?  The 352 isn't gone,  its just one of either the attacking or defending scenarios derived from tge 433.

327~~~
That is half the problem with football fans, for some once an opinion is formed in their heads it's very hard to change it. I saw nothing wrong with Blinds display on Saturday, likewise I saw nothing wrong with the teams performance given the opposition and the fact we had to bed in 5 players.
I think some fans see what they want to see as a way of justify their criticisims of a certain player or team performances.
It really is bizarre.

328~~~
this is last season with a designated holding midfielder. if anything, it's actually the reverse that sometimes is happening, where Blind pushes forward as a holding midfielder with Darmian, Shaw, and Smalling narrowing the back line

329~~~
That could be true but i rekon that this is unplanned.  Blind is so comfortable on the ball as a CB he actually dribbled out of defence in to midfield.  This made it look like smalling was the only defender playing centrally. 

I could see it working but that is going back years to the roots of total football and i think a tactic that is ultimately flawed. 

I did see however,  smalling and blind playing so distant from each other in horizontal terms that they were using the CDM in carrick as a pivot,  pretty much the 3 at the back.

330~~~
wasn't it the system that made the brand of Ajax 90s?

331~~~
DM (Carrick) dropping between the two CBs isn't anything new or groundbreaking. I'd say it's one of the most common tactical trends in football during last 5 or 10 years. It's purposedly done by possession-seeking teams to make their form as wide as possible when on ball. 

Blind is good enough CB if and only if we have enough possession (our midfield doesn't get eaten alive) and our high pressing works well so that our CB don't have to face our own goal too often.

332~~~
He did fine on Saturday but Spurs were a bit of shambles offensively and he wasn't tested to an extent you would have expected him to be. Obviously it has nothing to do with him and he did nothing wrong but that game will hardly serve as evidence that he can play there. Alan Smith once had a midfield masterpiece against Chelsea.

333~~~
that doesn't fit though.

it seems very unlikely when you play a couple of friendlies right before the first game, and 10 of them start v Tottenham, that Jones as the 11th man wasn't going to start.
I guess we'll never know.

334~~~
There's far poorer offences than Spurs though. They do have Kane and Eriksen. a Better combo than at least 10-12 teams can field.

However, he really can't be thinking Blind is anything more than a mere stopgap, either for Rojo to fit in, or someone being signed.

335~~~
Didn't Jackson write that Smalling would start even before Jones was ruled out? LvG also started Romero which wasn't expected, he had no minutes compared to Johnstone who did pretty well in preseason. It's true we'll likely never know but I think Smalling would've started anyways. Carrick and Rooney also started in the 'first team', to ensure our second team also had a captain Smalling might've played with them instead, giving Jones a chance to prove himself over Mike. That's my guess anyways.

336~~~
Van Gaal said after the PSG game that the right side of defense is an issue. This is the same game where Phil committed a yellow card worthy offense every minute he was on the pitch and only managed to avoid a booking because it was a friendly. I think that sealed the deal for him.

337~~~
Had a haircut

338~~~
The opposite of Smalling, been nice on the ball but drifts out of position too often.

339~~~
Agree with Neville. Brilliant tonight for me. Comfortable MOTM

340~~~
Deserved MoTM, almost faultless today, seems to be the only player out there that's passing has been on song.

341~~~
Great game from him. Keep this up please!

342~~~
will be destroyed by gestede, they said

343~~~
Maybe the old Dutch bastard knows what he's going?

344~~~
Still waiting for these 'inevitable' bad performances.

Flawless again.

345~~~
Eff the haters.

346~~~
Fantastic performance.

347~~~
Having someone like Blind at the back makes <i>all </i>the difference between not losing the ball under pressure...... how many <i>more </i>chances would we have conceded had we played with two CB's who aren't comfortable passing?

Brilliant performance.

348~~~
Exceptional performance. Gets a 9/10 for me.

So much for LVG not knowing shit by playing him CB ay.

349~~~
He has done surprisingly well at the back in these 2 games. I didn't see this coming, good to see he proved me wrong.

350~~~
So I guess apologies are in order from the caf then? 2 pretty much impeccable games from him. Long may it continue.

351~~~
Excellent performance. Never really looked in trouble defensively.

352~~~
He's making us all look like chumps with these good performances in a position we all said he would be a total bomb scare in. feck this guy.

353~~~
Good performance yet again but I'd still prefer a better centre back than him in our back four. He's shown he's a capable backup though.

354~~~
He was good in pre-season, good last week, better tonight.

355~~~
Maybe our most intelligent footballer in the team ?

356~~~
Both him and Romero barely had to do anything really. Smalling was being the more proactive partner.

357~~~
For once I'm not in the wrong side, I haven't complained about his new position.

358~~~
Brilliant game. Well played.

359~~~
That's not really true. He had a good performance and has done everything what was asked from him.

360~~~
Faultless. Proving me wrong so far.

361~~~
Looks very good so far as CB, even if Caf doesn't want to hear it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

362~~~
O'shea+  or premiem O'shea

363~~~
Played really well. Combative defending and smart passing at the same time.

364~~~
Top performance.

365~~~
I can't believe the amount of time I wasted arguing that we should at least wait until he's played a few games before judging him. Louis van Gaal must have seen something to play him there, something he could add.

That said it's only been two games, there's a lot of football ahead, it's a good start for him though.

366~~~
He did well but he's not been tested at all. Better managers than Sherwood will probably get at him and people admitting that he's proven them wrong are being a bit generous ahead of time.

367~~~
Well done Mr. Blind. Well done indeed.

368~~~
Both of the CB's were terrific.

369~~~
I think we do <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> but lets be realistic. We're 2 games into the season. What's the rush?

370~~~
Kane was going to destroy him...

<i>Nope</i>

Gestede would destroy him...

<i>Nope</i>

So who's the next striker? 

<i>Come on lads, you're bound to get it right one of these days...</i>

371~~~
I have to say, this is surprising. Maybe he's a CB afteral.

372~~~
I have to admit, he's doing much better than I expected

373~~~
People will still be critiscizing him on Monday for that tackle against club America in the box.

374~~~
Always backed him, never worried me if he was going to have to fill in at CB. People need to realise Jones is out, Evans isn't going to play and Rojo is an idiot so we needed someone back there and he is a really smart player with good distribution, he'll do a decent job until things get sorted. He's not the biggest or fastest but he has lots of strengths.

375~~~
We're still waiting for someone to destroy him and some manager to take advantage of his weaknesses. 
It can still happen but credit were credit is due.

376~~~
Did you notice how villa were bombing long balls into our box? Yet nothing substantial happened. Him and Smalling were brilliant

377~~~
Let me guess, cause of the passport..?

378~~~
Great performance. That sort of performance is exactly what Van Gaal wants our defenders to be able to do, and you can see why he wanted Ramos so bad.

379~~~
He knows how and when to press. This is a different kind of CB than we're used to.

380~~~
Smalling was dominant aerially, I already said that, he was more proactive in going for the header while Blind hung back and read the knock-ons. Villa do not have any height until that big bloke, Gestede came in which was rather late in the game and their service up to him was also not that accurate at all.

381~~~
He's looking very good. Happy that I'm one of the few who didn't judge him solely on his height and a game or so. Give it some time and see how it evolves before making a judgement. He's very similar to his father and he was a very decent left back converted to a centre back in a great team.

Anyway, would also like to add that height for centre backs is very much overrated these days even against lesser teams. Still want another centre back though.

382~~~
Correct.

(I actually like Rojo and have no problems with him starting for us, we just shouldn't be in a situation where he hasn't played yet)

383~~~
Yeah but that shouldnt have any correlation with his football.

384~~~
I love daley blind

385~~~
I enjoy the way he zips the passes into the midfield. So far, so good.

Don't understand how his average rating at the top of the thread is 5.9 after two clean sheets and good performances.

8/10 from me.

386~~~
Was flawless tonight. So good on the ball,  as we know, which is very useful to the team.

387~~~
Great performance once again. People were really worried about him as CB and Herrera being left out the team but so far it looks like the attack is by far the bigger problem

388~~~
Will we finally be able to stop with the endless "Terrified of seeing Blind up against X" posts we get before every match now? 

Was great tonight, looked solid and composed all match. His time at CB is probably limited once Jones and Rojo are fit, or we get a new CB in, but I won't be too worried of him having to fill in if injuries occur.

389~~~
Once again it looks like Blind has proved people wrong, havent watched the game but Blind - Smalling is a very interesting duo, on paper they should complementate eachother really well.

390~~~
Why the feck is his rating 5.9?

Easily two 7/10 performances. Even more if feeling generous

391~~~
Lots of people were obsessed him as CB would be a disaster (its probably half of what everyone was discussing all pre-season) and didn't want to give him any credit in the first game and likely tonight.

392~~~
I see unwarranted smugness is ripe in here, the old tortoise vs the Hare is one to keep in mind. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

He was solid tonight, certainly passes it well out of defense, but he pushes too far up too often meaning Shaw has to come across into his CB slot. He needs to work on that.

393~~~
We must see who is Brugge's best forward and then wait for a 'wait for _________ to massacre Blind tonight' on Tuesday. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

394~~~
For someone who's rarely put in a poor performance in his time here, Blind isn't highly rated on the Caf is he? Glad to see he played well again tonight. He may be an unspectacular player, but we need the likes of Blind in the squad.

395~~~
I'm liking the look of this Smalling and Blind partnership <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

396~~~
Did well tonight. Worries me when he brings it out, purely because I'm wary of the counter but we've got a decent shape defensively. It's just occasional sloppiness in midfield that has let teams in so far.

397~~~
A footballer with a brain can play most positions...Blind always plays to a good standard.

398~~~
Yeah, this annoys me quite a bit, to be honest.

399~~~
I have a feeling some on here (and twitter) want him to be a disaster so they can say "see I was right". 

Whether long term hes the right fit or not, so far, hes been good and fits well with the current back four. I do worry what happens if we get injuries, but for now, its going well.

400~~~
He did very well today (and made me look like a bit of an idiot in the process). Deserved MOTM in my view.

401~~~
I thought they did well, but we never did come under sustained pressure from crosses, more long balls from deep which gave Smalling time to get some well-timed headers in. Early days, though I'd still be happier with a specialist centreback.

402~~~
It is quite a good sign how rarely he has a poor game.  He was solid at left back last season, more then solid so far as a CB, which I assume is a position he hasn't really played before.  LVG saw something and Daley seems to be quite comfortable with and confident about the position change.  Few players seem to have as much trust from LVG as does Daley.  Must be somewhat surreal that he has managed both Daley and Danny Blind, same versatility, same consistency, like vader like son

403~~~
I've kept schdum with this Blind at CB business, so I'm not a hypocrite when I say I'm really chuffed to see him excel at CB over the past couple of games. Think it was a good idea from LVG to plop him there. It's great to have a ball-playing CB next to Smalling. Blind just seems so comfortable on the ball at the back that it just puts me right at ease when we're playing with the ball back there.

May not be the most physical of players but didn't seem to struggle against Gestede when he came on today. 

I actually won't mind if we don't get a CB. Smalling and Blind/Rojo will do me fine.

404~~~
I'm gutted he's got rid of the man bun. He played very well tonight, as for him playing centre half long term I'm not sure. I think he'll struggle against some of the better teams in the league.

405~~~
Great distribution 

Wasn't tested but still

406~~~
Good tonight. Up against shit though. When he's up against anyone decent he'll be in trouble. Still like him though.

407~~~
Lets wait til we play against a good side, then we can judge him properly. I still want Otamendi

408~~~
His passing was so crisp today, arguably we could've done with him in DM.

409~~~
Worse thing is when he makes an  inevitable mistake that a defender normally makes then this place will explode.  We've got to decide if what we are seeing is worth it & give him time to improve there.

410~~~
He's not rated highly by a lot of posters and it is a bit bizarre given how solid he's been for us in 3 positions now, it's probably because a section of the Caf seem to rate players on their physical attributes as opposed to footballing qualities and Blind isn't particularly strong or quick.

411~~~
He had a good debut season last year but the final 5-6 games he somehow became a scapegoat and retrospectfully became shite and a bad signing in the eyes of many for some reason, as soon as LVG started this experiment most already had their minds made up about him and still do. 

He's a good player and while not a permanent solution he'll do a job.

412~~~
Tottenham & villa arnt exactly the shittest clubs.  I'd give him the chance of being a permanent fixture at CB if he continues it.  2 clean sheets cant be a fluke as much as 2 goals from our attackers shows their current inabilities.

413~~~
How about shouldering most of the footballing responsibilities when we were pressed high up, bringing the ball out without resorting to long balls, easing pressure on the defence by maintaining possession whilst under heavy pressure? If we're talking proactive here, then lets talk about <i>why </i>Romero and Blind had "barely" anything to do, and the answer lies somewhere in between Smalling's defensive ability and Blind's organisational intelligence. Without Daley shouldering almost all the buildup from the back, Smalling would have a whole lot more to defend.

414~~~
Seems like the critics of Blind seem more focused on things he can't do with little credit given to what he brings to the table.  I'd still prefer that he not be a first choice CB for us, but he's been very solid thus far in 2 PL matches.  Smalling and Blind really seem to complement each other well.

415~~~
He's just a very good footballer. Glad he's getting the credit his performances merit. Deserved man of the match.

416~~~
That was never in doubt, that's the reason he was being played there but the questions everyone else had about him playing that position was if he had the defensive ability to keep up with quick attackers and how he'd fare when he has to defend a brute. 

Unlike what my post suggets, I rate Blind very highly, I thought he had an excellent debut season both as a midfielder and as a left back but the question is still very much in doubt if he can play center back as something more than a hobby.

417~~~
I'd like to see him vs the best, Aguero, Costa, Benteke. If he can handle them then there's no reason why he can't be a permanent ball playing CB for years to come. He's too negative and safe for midfield or LB. CB may be perfect for him. Excited for his and Smalling's partnership.

418~~~
Considering how important it is to Van Gaal to have a centre back who can carry the ball out and is comfortable with it I think we would be silly to drop Blind for either Jones of Rojo at the moment. It would be understandable if you could argue they are better more natural defenders but it's no coincidence we look at our best with Blind there.

It was always nice to feel calm when the ball went near our defence which with Rojo or particularly Jones I never do. It's a big compliment from someone like Neville to recognise how good he has been and was as i'm sure he will have been watching with interest.

419~~~
Only an idiot would ever label Blind a bad signing. His versatility is much-needed. I wasn't convinced about him playing CB, but so far, so good. We're lucky to have him on the team.

420~~~
Agreed that jury is still out on Blind as CB as he's yet to be tested against a decent team in form with strikers who can be considered best in PL. But he was not negative when playing LB. That is kind of strange accusation towards him. He was always complimenting Young and even in NT where he played LB, he was quick to get into attacking positions. Even in DM, he'd go chasing balls higher up the pitch and also scored few goals from that position, WBA and WHU comes to mind.

421~~~
Yeah, agreed with all of this. Especially the bit in bold. Though I wouldn't say he's a negative/safe full back, but it definitely applies to him in midfield.

His secure, accurate passing is nice and all that, but isn't forward-thinking, zippy, quick, or positive enough for midfield, but perfect for centre back.

Will be interesting to see him up against the big boys, like you say.

422~~~
I doubted him a lot prior to this game so I've got to give the credit where it's due. Top performance from him which hopefully he'll continue to display.

Smalling and Blind actually looks a decent partnership.

423~~~
Keeping a clean sheet against the hot property in England Harry Kane who half the caf wants to buy isn't good enough? I mean I want him to keep this up to believe he can do it for the long term as well but some of you talk like he's been playing against a man on a wheelchair.

424~~~
Blank his name with Otamendi and read the reviews of his performance.
Man has been fantastic in the last 2 games, credit where it's due

425~~~
Been very good at CB, which I didn't really expect. I do think he's better than Rojo at LB (maybe not if the other team is counter-attacking and has crazy pace out RW, as I remember what Yedlin did to him in that friendly this summer) and when Carrick moves on he'll get more matches at DM, too, so he'll get playing time somewhere or another.

426~~~
So can the people that flamed LVG for putting Blind CB stand in a line so we can mocking you?

427~~~
Rating at the top is from the first game. The average from both games will be there in a day or two when voting closes.

428~~~
Doing much better than I thought he would. Proving me very wrong. Hope he can keep it up.

429~~~
We should probably try playing him up front, because apparently he can literally play well anywhere. I am still cautious about him at CB, but it would be great if he could grow into the role. For those saying it's only because we haven't played anyone decent yet - can you imagine us plugging in any other players into central defence and keeping two clean sheets? I've seen Carrick look less comfortable in that position than Blind has so far

430~~~
Smalling  mostly looked after Kane. Kane was poor also.

431~~~
Had a very good game yesterday. Maybe there could be a future for him at CB.

432~~~
I really did think the Blind experiment would end badly and quickly, but I must say he has done a REALLY good job. It probably helps that Smalling takes on a lot of the man marking jobs against 1 striker, where as Blind is the sweeper, but even when challenged he won most of his tackles and I swear he even outjumped Gestede at 1 stage, couldn't believe that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It probably helps that having Shaw and Darmian on the wings makes us extra solid, but our defence these 2 last games have looked it's been for quite a while.

433~~~
I'm not sure what you want him to do in a game to show he was good. Kane was made to look poor because Smalling and Blind got to the ball before him every time. The mark of a good CB is not getting noticed, Rio Ferdinand being a prime example of that. Such a poor attitude towards a player who's been equally a part of the defensive unit as anyone else in keeping it safe at the back two games running.

434~~~
Making me eat my words so far. Really didn't fancy him at CB, thought his pace, height and strength would get found out. It's still early days but he's looking imperious so far. A real bonus!

435~~~
Still don't think he's the long term answer in central defence, but he's been fine so far this season.

Good to have a player like Blind in the squad.

436~~~
I don't really see where I have critisised him at all.

437~~~
"up against shit" "when he's up against decent" is taking credit away from a very good performance against one of the currently hottest prospects in the country.

438~~~
Sadly I think there a fair few Football fans like this these days. Not just United. I agree with your general point though.

439~~~
I don't know what it is about him, but I just have no problem with him with anything.

Other than something stupid like playing up top,or in goal, I don't think I would be overly concerned where he was asked to play at any given time as he seems to know his limitations and plays within them as best as he can to do the job he is asked to do.

Prime example of this is these two games at CB, you haven't seen him "do an Evans" when they brought the big man on, which is to say, play right up against him to the point where you can be beaten with knock downs, be rolled and end up having to drag the man down, concede a foul because you have to play through the player etc.

He stood off, leaving enough room to run in to make clearing headers, he didn't get involved in physical battles he couldn't win and so on.

He just seems to be an extremely competent footballer.

440~~~
I hope people now see the stupidity of declaring a decision as wrong without seeing one or two instances of how it pans out.

We thought we knew better sitting in front of a keyboard than someone who actually watches him train.

441~~~
Don't you think it's odd that despite Smalling apparently doing all of the defensive work, the number of tackles, interceptions and blocks made are almost identical? It seems pretty evident that Blind just goes about his job in a much more subtle, unfussy way.

442~~~
I actually prefer him at centre back than in midfield. I feel we get overrun with him in midfield (and can't see him playing in midfield anytime soon with arguably 3 holding midfielders ahead of him).

He was ok in the first game, looked shaky but hardly put a foot wrong (a bit like Romero) and he was exemplary last night.

443~~~
Is there no way to get it to update in real time as ratings are submitted?

444~~~
That's what I was trying to tell posters originally, football is a team game and so if the team perform better with him in it what's the problem? The manager obviously thinks his methods will be more effective with Blind in that position otherwise he wouldn't do it, but people seem to think Louis van Gaal wants to make life hard for himself intentionally so people will praise him more, i'm pretty sure he just wants the title even if it means playing his best team like any other manager.

445~~~
The whole setup has been very effective.  Blind seems to have such a great knack of knowing when to step up and press.  Even when the ball gets through Smalling is in great position to gather and clear it.  People talk about how Blind might be left behind for pace, but with Shaw, Smalling and Darmian there is always (so far) someone to cover.  They have only had a handful of games together.  It's bound to get better (Although there might be the odd mistake along the way).  It's very exciting to think of how it could develop.

446~~~
His Through ball to Depay fro his 2nd was tasty. Shows why he's in the team aswell. When your CB can pull a pass like that its almost cheating <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

447~~~
Him and Mike as a pair. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

448~~~
He's been absolutely brilliant again

449~~~
Yeah but he's shit and he'll be shown up god dammit! Three very impressive games means nout. In all seriousness, he's been excellent again.

450~~~
I just love how this threads gone silent from the haters.  BLIND 17 alternative kit for me.

451~~~
he looks to have learnt how to run aswell. Covered well for Shaw when Shaw got by passed with his press

452~~~
It's great to have a defender who's so good on the ball, was terrific defensively too. Hope LVG continues to play him, theres some potential in him as CB.

453~~~
Can't believe he just outmuscled Oulare like that

454~~~
I'm not sure if he's following instructions but he keeps making these long forward runs and than takes ages to get back into position. This leaves huge gaps at the back which better teams will take advantage of.

455~~~
Getting better and better every performance. Love this man.

456~~~
You'd hope that one of the two defensive midfielders/fullbacks would be aware for cover.

457~~~
Great game.

458~~~
Makings of a United legend here ? All jokes aside, as a dutchie i experiences a lovely match today. Amazing stuff.

459~~~
This isn't the Smalling thread

460~~~
I'm not too sure he's as weak as he's been portrayed. He's held his own against players like Kane, Agbonlahor and that giant feckwith Brugge had up front pretty well.

He's not fast but he's as clever as you'd like and as such rarely looses out on pace.

461~~~
Said in the unpopular opinions thread that he's going to be our best defensive player this season. He's calmness and intelligence personified.

462~~~
Physically was very good. I think he will surprise a few people this season at CB.

463~~~
His pace and strength were just fine tonight but he will obviously face bigger tests. But his reading of the game and passing were excellent. The 'Blind is shit' brigade are waiting in the shadows with their knives; one bad game and they will monopolise this thread.

464~~~
Some over the top praise in here, came in to praise him myself but he's had 3 easy games so far. 

At the moment he's what I expected a steady CB who provides calmness. I think he'll end up being replaced as he's not good enough in the air and a little too slow.

465~~~
Looks stronger than he was last year, and looks like he's put on some muscle.

He's doing great thus far at CB. Great through ball for the goal.

466~~~
He was exposed today more and did well with smalling covering at times too.

But we cannot leave him so exposed against better teams.

467~~~
Exposed due to pace, recovered due to intelligence. I like him at CB.

468~~~
He can form a formidable partnership with Smalling if both stay fit, ala Pique-Mascherano.

469~~~
I thought he was poor defensively in the first half but he redeemed himself with that pass to depay. Was better in the second half though although few moments where a better player would have exposed his lack of pace.

I would still prefer to see a better option there longer term but he has been better than I though, I think he is very reliant on smalling though who is covering for him a lot and alongside any of our other centre halves I could see things going very wrong. In fairness to blind though he does help smalling in terms of distribution.

470~~~
A couple of good recoveries in the game, passed it really well and it was fun to see him use a couple of sneaky shoves to win back possession against bigger opponents. There was also one nice moment where he just ran straight past the guy who got to the ball ahead of him and took it straight off him as he turned.

471~~~
Another good performance by Blind. Some of his passes were fantastic, especially the one for Memphis' second. 

He and Smalling really do compliment each. Long may the partnership continue.

472~~~
The new Utility man,O'Shea would be proud of him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

473~~~
His pass for Memphis was really, really good. Shows why LvG wants him as a CB I guess. Defensively was pretty sound too. He is making me look very wrong about him and it's great. Hope the partnership continues to develop, it is looking good.

474~~~
Ran 9.5 km too. A beast.

475~~~
Total Football bruh, Smalling does/did it too.

476~~~
Smalling and blind fit so well together. I can't wait until their first big challenge.

477~~~
I have been satisfied with his performance so far. As cliched as it might sound that we have a long season ahead of us, he will make mistakes but he is one of those intelligent footballers who will adapt and learn. I would like us to give him chance this season and play him consistently at CB and not keep shifting him from CB to LB to midfield (at least midfield should not happen with the options we have).

But whom do we have as cover for Shaw? If Shaw gets injured I do not want to see Blind slotting there.

478~~~
That's how I saw it. Smalling was a one man central defense at times.

It has worked well so far; his passing has been very good from the back and does help the team, but his positioning still leaves me scared defensively. He would have been perfect if he was couple of inches taller and had just a little more pace.

Rojo.

479~~~
Proving me wrong with every good performance at CB. Hes one of the better more accurate passers in the squad so he gives us a great option building up play from the back. Still I would like to see his performance against the very top calibre players to judge him at CB but so far so good.

480~~~
It's so funny reading this thread. Every single game it's "he does x which a harder/better/faster/stronger [team/striker/opponent] will expose. And still nothing's happened.

481~~~
Was very good yesterday night. Proving me wrong so far and long may it continue <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

482~~~
He's been our best distributor this season, he can really inject pace into our game with those fizzing passes between the lines.

483~~~
How many other CB's in world football would have been able to pull off that pass for Memphis' second goal? 

Such a brilliant pass.

484~~~
His vision and passing is a joy to watch, he's so composed on the ball and he's looking like he could develop into the central defender that van Gaal wants.

Hope he goes from strength to strength this season in that role.

485~~~
just a comment on Blind height or the lack of as mentioned by some posters, he is 180 cm (according to his wiki page) and Nemanja Vidic is 190 cm (wiki) thats a difference of 10 cm. Now thats not much at all. Sergio Ramos is 183 cm (wiki). Blind lack of height, according to me isn't a concern at all. He looks stronger on the pitch and you add that to the intelligence he has which is second to none, I think we have a genius on our hands. Just let him do his thing without much pressure and watch him thrive this season.

486~~~
That's true, plus how many so called "giant" players are playing nowadays, where the trend of football mostly consists of playing the ball to feet rather than crosses and high pass constantly? Of course there will be players that is going to be handful to handle but that would be Smalling's task I believe.

487~~~
Blind is taller than Cannavaro, the last defender to win Ballon d'Or. Cannavaro's only 1,76 m.

488~~~
Have you ever stood next to someone 10cm taller than you?

489~~~
He's only a tiny bit shorter than Steve Bruce (although with a much different physique!) and he and Pallister were a great partnership.

490~~~
Clearly his other attributes help to cover up his physicality like his height and he's been really good the past few games with Smalling. However I'm still worried he'll eventually be found out as top class tall strikers will be able to take advantage.

491~~~
I will say i'm glad he got rid of the ponytail. I lost some respect for him but now he's come to his senses which is good <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

492~~~
I still think Blind is one our best signings. Just get the impression he'll do anything he can to help the team. He's a skilful, two-footed and better-looking John O'Shea. What's not to like?

493~~~
Done great so far. Stays on his feet, reads things well and is good on the ball as we saw with the assist too.

Bigger tests to come, so far he has adapted well as he has a good footballing brain.

494~~~
So you're telling me LVG isn't some random bloke plucked from the pub to coach United? WHo would have thought the manager knew what he was doing.

495~~~
Height doesn't automatically equate to strength in the air though... Vidic and Ramos are incredibly strong in the air, Blind isn't. Jonny Evans is around the same hight as Vidic, but there is a clear difference in their strength/ability in the air.

Thought he was grand again last night, must be a right laugh playing next to Smalling at the moment.

496~~~
Almost got caught out once or twice but recovered well. His passing from the back is brilliant and a huge asset.

497~~~

498~~~
I was going to say something along theae lines too.   Must be easy to put on weight.  My gf does it no problem.

499~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

500~~~
I don't think metres alone is the issue people have, it's his overall size.  What Smalling did several times on Tuesday, having players bounce off him and end up on their arses, is what people expect from a CB.  Blind is very intelligent in what he does (except wandering up the pitch sometimes) but I don't think he's really been tested on the run or cross yet.  The way he stops attackers and takes possession reminds me of a fullback.

501~~~
Lack of height isn't a problem at all, his only real lacking as a centre half is pace. Fortunately he has Smalling and Shaw beside him so can be protected for the most part. I hope he can form a lasting partnership with Smalling and prove the doubters wrong.

502~~~
I thought blind was very average/slow as a LB but as a CB there are many many slower.  I actually think he is on the lower scales of a fast CB?

503~~~
I think it's Carragher who said that Terry had no pace to lose.

504~~~
Not sure if he said that but thats my point.  Mertesacker, terry,  hummels & maybe Kompany are slower CB's off the top of my head.

505~~~
You mean strikers like Kane...who scored zero goals against us? Too short?
How about <span style="font-size: 12px">Rudy Gestede, 6' 4", who also scored...zero goals.
I think we will need to wait about 10 games before making any judgements, but so far, our CB pairing is the best in the league.

To be a decent CB, you have to have many other attributes, than just height. Blind uses his intelligence to make up for his deficiencies, in the same way that Phil Jones uses his physique to make up for his lack of intelligence. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/></span>

506~~~
Snap <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

507~~~
Of course I've stated he's been absolutely fine so far. But it's still to early to judge.

508~~~
One of the criticisms you hear is "if you get someone who is physical like Costa, how will he deal with him." As a defensive midfielder, surely the physical side of his job (strength and generally pressing the forward) shouldnt be a worry?

509~~~
Just to add to your example of a short WC defender: Puyol (178 cm), Cannavaro (176 cm), Scirea (178 cm), Baresi (176 cm), Gentile (178 cm), Moore (178 cm), Vierchowod (180 cm), etc.

510~~~
I am pleasantly surprised by his performances. He really looks comfortable at CB, everyone was asking who would LVG Schweinsteiger from our squad. Could he be the one? Early signs looks promising. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Now lets not just get on his back when he makes his first eventual mistake.

511~~~
I think he will have a Blinder, exactly a type of game he could shine in, we will have ball all the time and he can orchestrate it from the back while Mike eliminates all the danger..

512~~~
He's been class, gotta be careful with Mitrovic but I think every CB will have issues during a game with this guy, he's an Oak.

513~~~
Him and Smalling have a great understanding.

514~~~
Immaculate today, got my MOTM.

515~~~
Thought his defending for the last Newcastle attack was great. Forcing Cisse out wide saved us the point, would have been an easy tap in for Thauvin.

516~~~
Another good performance. Despite being against it to begin with I hope he and Smalling continue to develop their partnership.

517~~~
Yeah Blind dealt with that situation really well. He's been excellent at CB so far this season.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/9wwl" width="560"></iframe>

518~~~
Doing very well. The experiment is working so far.

Is anyone else finding themselves going <i>christ, how out of position were you there Blind?... </i>a few times a game in the opening games of the season? Not saying he's been shit or anything because credit where it is due he has played very well but I feel he is out of position so much and Smalling is covering him. Not saying it is definite, it is just how I feel.

520~~~
Good defending there by Blind.  As others have mentioned, him and Smalling have struck a nice partnership and complement each other well.  Not really concerned about Blind's supposed lack of height and/or pace.  He's tall enough and fast enough to get the job done in more situations than not, and there's plenty of examples of defenders of similar height and slower pace who are excellent central defenders.  His intelligence is what really sets him apart though.  That and his ball-playing ability gives him the edge on 90% of CBs.  Can't think of any PL CBs technically better with the ball than Blind.

521~~~
Few posters mentioned it, positioning and Smalling covering for him but I don't see that at all.

522~~~
Nope. Out of the two Smalling is the one more visible though because he's the one to charge up to the striker 90% of the time due to his quick recovery ability thanks to his speed and physical presence which Blind does not possess.

523~~~
agree it happened several times an Smalling recovered for him well. He plays it maybe too risky, anyway so far we didn't concede many goals and I'd suggest let them play together, they are well balanced pair and against lesser opponents when we need to attack it works..

524~~~
Fair play lads. Haha.

525~~~
That's why you have a defensive partnership, to cover each other.  Our defense has looked more solid than any other in the league so far, they're working as a unit which is what we've missed in the past.

526~~~
Not more solid than City's who have faced better opponents so far.

527~~~
Yep, definitely. I think that was one thing that was really missing from our defence last year. A solid and interlocking partnership. They both seem to play well with each other.

528~~~
I would argue they've been as least as solid, teams are getting very little change against us, still as you say City have faced tougher opponents so it's a little harder to compare.

529~~~
It's much easier to look a good defender when you are well protected and opponents offer little going forward, the big tests are still to come and I still believe he will get exposed regularly, especially in any game which becomes stretched.

He definitely plays some great passes from that position but whether or not it will be worth it once the defence is put under more pressure I am still not convinced, the three opponents we have had so far have been very poor going forward.

530~~~
They've been fairly solid so far, but I don't particularly think they've received a stern test at all yet. We largely controlled the Spurs and Villa games, even if we only one goal, and were also the more dominant team against Newcastle despite our failure to score. They've not had a game yet where they've regularly been up against it. City have also comfortably won all of their games, but have definitely come up against more tricky opposition than us.

Our tougher games will definitely be a massive indicator as to Blind's ability at centre back, though. He's looked comfortable there so far, but it's going to be a lot more difficult for him if he comes up against a tricky striker who's constantly pressing him and has a lot of physicality to his game.

531~~~
A really good/risky passer with his distribution from the back and the few times he's had one-on-ones and/or been been isolated, he's done really well to stay on his feet and use every ounce of his strength to shepherd it out/minimalise the situation.

He's playing well because of his intelligence and the system. I think he'll be able to continue his form/performances against most of the sides outside the top 4-5. When we face those ones though..it'll be interesting to see, if we can contain them defensively and if Blind can step up.

532~~~
I'll say that I am glad we have played relatively weaker opponents than City as that probably gave our CB partnership time and space to gel with each other and build that understanding. 
The more stern test will be the coming weekend and then against Liverpool followed up by Southampton. However, if we does get bullied and has an off day, the media will be on our backs complaining why we did not buy a proven CB. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

I am satisfied with our options at the back. Given time and luck (with injuries), Smalling and Blind could be a good partnership

533~~~
Like Harry Kane?

534~~~
Anyone else think Blind has been a huge part of Smalling's towering performances so far? Alongside Blind he has the responsibility to attack every ball and he thrives on that. He can push 20 yards out of position because he knows Blind will diligently sweep up behind and close off any gaps that appear in the most economical fashion. The roles and responsibilities are very clearly defined.

Alongside Rojo or Jones that responsibility to attack every ball is cut in half and the roles become much more blurred. None of the three excel at sweeping in behind and they all spend less time attacking the ball than they'd like.

Smalling-Blind is an unconventional partnership but for me it makes complete sense when Smalling's in the mood that he is. Blind is almost the perfect partner for him.

535~~~
Of course, have been saying from the very beginning. Blind is a very intelligent player and probably our best player tactically wise. While Smalling is our leader in the defense, Blind is helping him a lot and is one of the main reasons why our defense is looking so strong.

The problem though will be when Smalling gets injured. All combinations of our CB would look weak IMO, although Rojo-Jones will scare the shit out of opponents.

536~~~
Lets see how they cope with Benteke, Aguero and some of the more challenging forward lines. So far so good but I have a niggling feeling this is just a honeymoon pairing that could come down with a bang and not recover. Also just an injury to Smalling to having a very average looking CB pairing. Still need a top CB in the door for me.

537~~~
Blind is underated. He's everything that Jones isn't. He could play in a Barcelona team and not look out of place in my humble opinion.

538~~~
Morgan Schneiderlin for both

539~~~
Isn't that the point? How many teams really do come to Old Trafford and offer a lot going forward, I watched a lot of games last season where playing with two proper CB's was just a complete waste of time for me, especially since Smalling or Jones are unable to do anything particulary useful with regard to bringing the ball out of defence.

540~~~
Yes, for the reasons you mention and the far simpler one that Blind seems to be the only central defender we have who is willing to try and organise everyone around him. Post Rio/Vidic we've been crying out for someone to be a talker, reminding everyone else of their jobs and organising our defensive line. 

Smalling and Jones are both great instinctive defenders but don't seem willing or able to pay attention to anyone else around them. With Blind taking charge of our defensive line we're getting teams offside far more often and more effectively than we did in the past (my impression anyway, would be interesting to see a stat) plus we seem to be defending set-pieces much better, for similar reasons.

541~~~
I agree, but theres no reason why a little organization from LVG (or buying someone else instead of Rojo who isnt another meathead like Jones) cant stop both players from attacking the ball. If LVG told Rojo and Jones to let Smalling attack everything and they couldn't follow that instruction, then we have big problems.

542~~~
Have a look at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/chris_smalling/165/165/584/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/daley_blind/165/165/7674/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/john_terry/165/165/72/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/gary_cahill/165/165/451/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/vincent_kompany/165/165/543/0/p#tackles_won/tackles_lost/aerial_duels_won/aerial_duels_won_%/interceptions/blocks/clearances/defensive_errors#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these stats</a>.

Schneiderlin's played a big part in our clean sheet in the league so far but, make no mistake, our central defenders have still had plenty of work to do.

543~~~
That's because the manager can't control players from the sidelines, like he's playing Pro Evo. 

It's well and good giving them detailed instructions but they won't be followed without the players on the pitch constantly talking to and covering for each other. Which is where the Blind/Smalling partnership is working well.

544~~~
Indeed. Blinds intelligence as a player can not be underrated in this partnership. I'm keen to see how they do vs Gomis and then Benteke before I give it my full seal of approval. However so far so good.

545~~~
He has really exceeded my expectations this season so far. I liked him in midfield last year but didn't think he would be good in defence, so far so good though and he deserves to start ahead of Rojo and Jones. His passing is sublime too, he is our only center half truly capable of taking the ball forward and he is probably one of the best ball playing defenders in the league. We might not even need a new center half for a while if he carries on this level of performances. Such intelligent footballer too, it's main reason why he is able to adapt in so many roles.

546~~~
Its also very interesting that we've ended up here with Smalling and Blind as the partnership, our two best readers and more intelligent CBs. 

Last season LVG wanted Jones and Rojo at CB instead, all athleticism and aggression while the best at covering others and seeing out danger, Smalling was left on the bench

547~~~
just think if they can be viable as it is without the presence of Schneiderlin. I don't think LvG will fancy this duo with only Carrick as the shield in front. 
actually can't gather info about this opinion for now until Jones and Rojo are back

548~~~
Are you sure about that, I think we shuffled a lot of CB partnerships due to injuries and LVG's preferred partnership and most used was Jones-Smalling, then after that Smalling-Rojo. 
I may be wrong though.

549~~~
This is correct. He persisted with Jones-Smalling when they were fit, with Rojo on the bench. Which was going against his left-footed/right-footed combo and probably reflects a severe lack of confidence in Rojo in the centre. 

What's really curious is why Blind never once got a came in central defence last season, other than that awful 352 (I think?) 

Obviously injuries and a weak central midfield forced his hand but surely there were at least a few games where Blind could have played as part of a two man CB pairing?

550~~~
Maybe it was an idea he have come up with in preseason before this season and up until now it has been working. Don't remember if he played even one game at CB last season.

Edited the post cause I realized I said the same thing about Blind not playing in CB. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

551~~~
Smalling was fit and available, he was just not the preference and was left out. Jones was the man for the right side and LVG was insisting on having a left footer at CB (hence Blackett got chances)

It was injuries that led to Smalling and Jones playing together. They did it very well and then Rojo couldnt get back into the team

552~~~
I'm fine with our defence. I think it is on par with most of the big teams. Smalling and Blind with Jones and Rojo competing seems pretty good, and our full backs are sorted, with adequate cover. Blackett should go on loan to get some games. McNair might be worth keeping around but he needs games too ideally.

Not certain about the keeper situation. I guess ideally in a week's time De Gea is still here and gets welcomed back into the fold, but Romero's form has been decent.

553~~~
Kane's a very good striker of course, but he didn't pose <i>that </i>much of a threat against us, largely because we were controlling more of the game.

554~~~
Easily could slot in instead of Mascherano

555~~~
There may have been 1 or 2 games when we started in 352 and Blind dropped into the CB position later on to make a 4.  Carrick definitely did that a couple of times, Blind may have.

556~~~
Nope. Got a game next to McMair in a back four against Crystal Palace and did well.

557~~~
He's been quite impressive so far tbf to him. I didn't think it would work at all, but the signs have been promising.

I'm still concerned that when we come up against a proper threat (Newcastle & Villa are terrible) then he'll still struggle. I don't see him coping well with the pace/power of the likes of Aguero/Benteke/Bony/Costa/Giroud etc etc 

Hopefully he proves me wrong.

558~~~
Blind played centreback in a 4 too, but that was forced by injury and I cannot remember against who. The most likely reason van Gaal didn't use him there more often is because we only had Blind and Carrick as CDM and Blind was also needed at LB alot with Shaw being injured. He didn't have the luxury of trying him there alot because he was needed elsewhere.

559~~~
For 4 and a half games so far it needs to be said that this guy has been fecking exceptional.

He's got a left wing of Shaw and Memphis to cover for and he's done so superbly. Movement, reading of the game and dirty work has been almost perfect.

Harry Kane is still searching for a way out of his pocket over 2 league games after meeting the Dutch god of defence. That's how good he is.

EDIT - He nearly scored an own goal. Typical <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

560~~~
Positioning is seriously off tonight

561~~~
They are waltzing past Carrick in midfield and as Blind has no pace it's leaving him seriously exposed, I'd bring Schneiderlin on just to protect that back 4.

562~~~
You've probably only got that chance in mind. I've only seen it replayed once but it looked like Darmian was behind the CBs which he should never be.

563~~~
Their good passes behind the defense have all come from the space behind him.

564~~~
3 times he has let the runner go reacting late behind him. Problem is he doesn't have any pace to recover either.

565~~~
He seems to be in shock ever since Rooney scored. Should be fine after half time.

566~~~
Midfield isn't providing our defense any cover whatsoever.

567~~~
Proving me and lots of others wrong so far. The tests will get harder when he comes up against teams with pace and power and who move the ball around quicker but for now I can have no complaints. He certainly seems to organise the defence said as someone has already mentioned, I really didn't expect him to be so good at LCB but you do fear there's a mistake there waiting to happen.

568~~~
Spot on, players are getting time in midfield to pick passes and with the pace they have up top he's getting exposed.

569~~~
Carrick is having a off day today, I've barely heard his name mentioned and Herrera definitely is not a holding CM!

570~~~
That seems to be the issue. The midfield being not up to it tonight doesn't help either but it was his player that got away too many times

571~~~
There were a couple of aerial moments where he looked dodgy. I think we'll play him until he comes unstuck and then probably go back to the main CB's.

572~~~
Think he missed that extra protection in midfield in the first half. Still wasn't too bad though.

573~~~
Our defensive unit relies on greater cover from midfield in order to let Blind do his best work. I mentioned the other day that teams running through us centrally had ended with Schneiderlin, the job he does was sorely missed in the first half and left Blind's physical shortcomings exposed. Thankfully Bastian bossed the second half and with Herrera further forward we pushed them back. I think if we are to continue getting the good things we've gotten out of Blind atr CB, he needs the Schneiderlin protection.

574~~~
Failed offside trap. lol

575~~~
Hard to argue with that assessment. He did look exposed at times last night.

576~~~
We all know he lacks pace so that showed last night but going forward hes excellent at starting movements from the back like with the first goal.

577~~~
So would any defender. Watch Chelsea defenders with and without matic. They get exposed a lot without matic or if he has a bad game.

578~~~
60/61 passes. 98.4% succes rate. Not bad for a wednesday night.

579~~~
He's having a really good season but there's certain games we need to be weary about starting him. Kane was unable to, but you know Liverpool will target him with Benteke and losing a goal purely down to having a small guy at centre back would be a bit lame.

580~~~
Any set pieces we'd just stick Mike on him and leave it at that. Most of the aerial balls are attacked by Smalling anyway and Blind sweeps up. Also helps us that he's flanked by Smalling and Shaw so if he's targetted to expose his lack of pace there's plenty of cover either side of him. Starting to convince me he can play there long term..

581~~~
Mascherano has not had too many issues over his lack of height or the fact that he had been used to playing elsewhere. Blind will be our Mascherano. Love this player.

582~~~
It looked to me that he had to push up a lot in the 1st half because Herrera and Carrick failed to close the Bruges attackers most of the times.

583~~~
His pace worries me more than his height, but with the way we play we shouldn't be too worried about being caught on the break too often. It could be dangerous if we have to chase a game though, for example in a cup match.

I'm pleasantly surprised so far though.

584~~~
He's fine defensively as long as he gets some protection from the midfield and can focus on his positioning to cut out passes. When teams run through our midfield or throw in cross after cross this could become a problem. Our possession based approach helps prevent this but I worry that sooner or later it'll cost us. 

His passing from the back is fantastic though. He's ultra composed on the ball and always seems to find a passing solution even if strikers are pressing. He never seems to launch a hopeless ball forward (something Smalling is still guilty of). He's key to our possession game.

585~~~
Mascherano is stronger than Blind, and faster, too. And teams are scared of pushing too high against Barca for fear of being overwhelmed at the back with that famed front line. And there is also the fact that the Premier League is more physical than the La Liga. 

When teams will play big strong pacey attackers upfront or press our midfield and defence and force mistakes or start putting in crosses for multiple target men, Blind will be exposed. He doesn't belong in central defence in this league for a club like United. 

We rely too much on our full backs to keep opposition wingers quiet and the long balls over defence minimal. Blind's shortcomings are being covered by the form of the other three in defence. I agree with the fact that if our full backs are on the offensive chasing a game and get caught, Blind's lack of pace and height will be a grave issue. 

It can't be denied that he <i>does </i>add the extra composure and passing efficiency to the defence. 98.4%, as imperi pointed out. As long as there are other people covering up for his weaknesses, he is doing what he does best - pass the ball around intelligently, make well timed tackles and position himself well. But I'm afraid he's just a tactical trap away from a disaster. The top PL teams will expose him. I'd rather we'd signed a proper ball playing CB in his place.

586~~~
Can anyone disagree with the fact that LVG has got this one spot on? He's passing from the back is immense and so so so important to our play. He is often playing fast and deadly accurate passes to our attackers which creates chances. Also he's very solid on the ground and has wonderful communication and leadership skills. 4/5 clean sheets (one own goal) is pretty impressive too

587~~~
So the bashing starts, Blind can do no right seemingly. Last season it was the same - ten good games and one bad one and he should be gone.

He's done extremely well so far. Football is not so simple that if you put a strong oar against a small defender he will get eaten alive. Put amazing incredible PL proven Walters against small Cannavaro and he will look like a fool 9 times out of 10. This is exactly why English football is in its current state, being convinced that football is only for huge strong athletes and smaller players do not belong there.

588~~~
Gomis will be a good test this weekend. He bullied Chelsea's "proper centre-halves" the other week so it will be interesting to see how Blind fares against him as everyone has been waiting for a big, athletic striker to exploit his weaknesses.

589~~~
I think a lot of the aerial threat he might face is also cut out because we have two good defensive full backs that will stop a majority of the quality crosses from reaching the box. Still, Monk always has something up his sleeve so it will be interesting to see if he targets Blind.

590~~~
Give it up, be happy for a man who's doing very well and stop trying to predict the future. Especially if you're going to be so pessimistic about it

591~~~
To be fair they have only gomis who is tall. Behind him they play sigurdson cork  ki or someone who are hardly tall or even fast. Emnes they may play but he is not a very good player other than his strength.

Edit- meaning smelling will handle him

592~~~
Gomis could well be the acid test as to just how good Blind at centre back really is.

593~~~
I think hes pretty fast for a CB; i just dont grt how he is slow?

594~~~
Are we still talking about Blind? Because if so unless he turns into a GK he is painfully slow whatever way you look at it! He's been very good this season though and long may it continue!

595~~~
Way too early to make that assessment. He hasn't been tested yet and he's getting a huge amount of protection. The other three defenders are defensive beasts and we have two midfielders screening. Smalling is winning pretty much everything in the air and one the ground. It's not hard to look decent in those circumstances. Playing Blind there is pretty stupid imo and will cause us problems when we come up against better opposition.

596~~~
So what you're saying is with all these other 'beasts' and protection we can afford to have a rolls Royce of a centre back, someone who can dictate tempo and organise thise other beasts. You're saying he's pretty much the ideal centreback to compliment our other defensive players. I mean we would've want another player in the same mold as Smalling would we? That would be unbalanced. Really, really good point Steve.

597~~~
He made one horrific boob in terms of positioning agin Bruges (was it the one where Diaby or whoever got dispossessed fantastically by Romero just before half time?) but otherwise was pretty decent again.

598~~~
As a negative though, and yes this is vital, the beard he was sporting on Wednesday was terrible.

Like one of those Amish folks in America. He needs to sort that out.

599~~~
Spot on haha. If the other 3 are doing such a good job, why not have someone who's a brilliant ball player

600~~~
That looked bad, but I think he was pushing up the offside trap and Carrick didn't move up with the rest of them. I don't really know who to blame in that situation, I'd have to see it again. Regardless, that's the one noticeable mistake out of five games, which is pretty good. I'm starting to believe in him as a centre back, and this might only be the start

Also, I don't think it's fair to say the other defenders are making up for him. Blind has been making tons of tackles and interceptions himself

601~~~
I agree, its completely annoying. Got a haircut but forgot to lose the beard.

602~~~
No I am certainly not saying we can afford to have Blind in there. Pretty sure I said he will be a problem when we come up against better opposition. Can you read? 

Also this ball playing tempo dictating CB stuff is a load of rubbish. A CB really just needs to be able to defend well and give simple balls to the more attacking players. When Blind gets cleaned out a few times you'll be begging LVG to put an actual defender in there.

603~~~
Blind is now a brilliant ball player?? If he was a brilliant ball player we would have seen it last season when he was playing midfield. Instead he really struggled. For a CB he would be a good passer. But he's too small, weak and slow for the position.

604~~~
I dont think thats true.  We dont need a ball playing CB; but having one helps a tonne.  There are times in matches where it is only our 2 central defenders occupying our defensive area and not having an intelligent/calm/composed defender like blind will bring about its own problems.

605~~~
You're so deluded about him, as a CB Blind is one of the best passers you'll get. He actually did a good job in CDM in the first half of the season, faded away afterwards.

606~~~
He's a midfielder playing CB. Of course his passing will be better than most CBs. I don't dispute this. 

My problem with playing him at CB is that his physical attributes are completely unsuited to playing at position. He's literally the only CB I've ever seen at a top league club who is small, slow and weak. He didn't have the physical capabilities to cut it in midfield last season where you don't need to be as quick or strong. But now he's suddenly the answer in central defence? 

Yep. I'm the one who's deluded.

607~~~
No, but he's complementing Smalling's shortcomings with his attributes, while Smalling's complementing his and thus they've formed a great partnership thus far. It's not about personnel itself but about the unit and as a unit we've conceded just 1 goal which was an own goal in opening 5 games and that's without DDG and his superhero abilities. You don't fix something that's not broken.

Oh, and no, being a defender nowadays is not just about defending, especially in LVG's system. Mascherano himself is even smaller than Blind, he's not built like a rock and not Bolt himself either yet it didn't stop him playing CB for Barcelona.

608~~~
As a balance sometimes smallings physicality is enough for the both of them.

609~~~
This is a nice idea. But realistically we're playing a midfielder at centre half. A midfielder that wont be able to deal with pace or power. Eventually we will be at a disadvantage compared to teams who have two specialist centre halves.

610~~~
A few times vs Brugge he was caught out of position and tried to play offside.... however I have to say he has done remarkably well AND he can defend.

611~~~
Or eventually we won't. His lack of pace is not a problem as long as he's positioning himself well enough, as he's shown against Sterling when he played at LB last season in the Liverpool match. Specialist centre halves probably don't have Blind's passing range unless they're, don't know, Hummels himself, so we'll benefit from it and our system, like it or not, relies on playing it from back.

612~~~
The other thing is; even against teams like chelsea, city, spurs we will dominate posession to the point that playing 2 strengthy CB's is an almost useless excerise. 

I worry more against teams who will battle us for possesion itself like arsenal, swansea & liverpool. 

It's not like we dont have rojo to add a bit of steel when we do need it.

613~~~
The difference is he was playing as the only defensive midfielder with 4 offensive midfielders in front of him in a new league and struggling shit, what do you expect? He isnt one of the slowest CB's around as well, he's a relative slow LB but some act as if he has Pirlo's pace, that's a huge exagerration. And even though he's small, he proves that timing is most important, besides that, he's just a few centimeters shorter than Ramos ffs. Looking forward to see you jumping on the bandwagon after he makes a mistake. Cheers.

614~~~
I don't agree with the second half of his post but the jury is still out on blind. He hasn't come up against any real notable strikers yet,

So far so good so there can be NO complaints IMO, I definitely see the effect he has there but he IS yet to be tested. Of course that doesn't mean people should pretend that he's a timebomb waiting to happen.

615~~~
Boom get in.  I just dont see how the guy is a slow CB.  Might not be koscielny but neither is he a mertascker or terry.

616~~~
Wankfest over Kane doesn't stop, one of the top scorers last season, was meant to wipe the floor with Blind. Then you've got this guy who scores 70% of his goals with headers at Villa, not even bothered either. Who are we waiting for, Aguero who destroys just any defender in the league and probably world to 'prove a point'? Benteke or Lukaku who had no problem manhandling Smalling and Jones? Then Blind will be busted as slow, weak physically, etc.?

Agree with Sammy here, this thread will turn into right shit once something bad happens.

617~~~
I find it odd people say he aint played anyone of note yet, when we played vs Spurs first game of season

618~~~
Defending tactics LVG uses are not just positioning, intercepting and tackling.

A lot of the tactics used by LVG are meant to keep opponents running. If players are asked what they remember most when playing against LVG's Ajax they always say they remember that they had to keep running all the time.

This is accomplished for instance by different players running forward from the back or from moving the ball from left to right on the pitch and back again, using CB's too. Many of these tactics have to be organized from the back and CB's need to pass well and with pace too. If this is organized and done well this will result in outnumbering opponents in midfield or atackers from opponents defending and being out of position.

Blind is organizing this from the back. He will concede goals because of his strenght, height and pace, but he is also preventing goals because opponents are tired down and the midfield can dominate.

619~~~
Yep a tired kane and agbonlahor are the best the premier league have to offer. Hmm.

Swansea away will be a good test as gomis looks in form and ayew loves to cut inside and shoot. Hope he does great.

I see what LVG is trying to do with blind and it is working. I'm just waiting before coming to an opinion.

I'm not going to slag him off and say he's a timebomb likewise I won't say he's going to be brilliant there, the jury is still out for me.

620~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

621~~~
This is another thing, against Brugge I think both Blind and Smalling had covered nearly 10kms during the match, it is a bloody lot for a CB.

What?

And no, I didn't mean Agbonlahor, I was talking about that new striker who was meant to strip Blind off his aerial weakness.

Menippean satire is a tad wasted on you isn't it? I thought I made it abundantly clear I didn't agree with your post, obviously not. 

Still, keep to your 'defenders don't need to be footballers' stance akin to the early 90s, I guess we also need to play 4-4-2 with a big man little man combo up front, if only someone had told Barca they've been doing it all wrong!

623~~~
We'll see how this one pans out. Personally I hope we bring Jones or Rojo back into the side when fit. Smalling and Jones had a good partnership at the end of last season without having a good right back and two midfielders screening the defence. Now that we have the midfield and full back positions sorted we are close to having a fecking brilliant defensive unit. Swap Romero and Blind with De Gea and Jones and I think we'll be almost impossible to score against. That would be a great foundation to build from and make us a genuine threat in all competitions, even the CL. Let's stop fecking around with playing players out of position and get the basics right.

What I will say which I probably haven't so far in this thread and needs to be said is how well Blind has done. For a player with limited experience playing there and who lacks almost every physical attribute required for the role he has handled it extremely well and deserves a lot of credit. I don't think he's that good a player but I'm coming around to the fact that he's a very solid professional who will not let us down when called upon. He deserves respect. I don't want to see him become a whipping boy when his lack of pace and power inevitably costs us goals

624~~~
I have no idea what that is so yes it probably is wasted on me. Is that second bit menippean satire as well? Can't you just respond to what I've actually been saying?

625~~~
Rijkaard was a midfielder playing at CB too. Was a big part of how great a team that was.

Why don't you accept that LVG plays different tactics and needs different skills in positions as a result? Why don't you accept that players need to adapt to that over time and can make mistakes? Even struggle at times.

Do yourself a favour and watch a game from a year ago and appreciate the enormous progress made.

626~~~
OK here goes.

Football has progressed, you need defenders capable of more than just being a physical presence at the back now, every top manager has a ball playing centre back in their starting XI and when you play the type of controlled football out from the back we do a player like Blind is even more important. 

Nobody is saying he's the next Bobby Moore, but his supposed weaknesses - pace and physicality - seem to be wildly exaggerated, we seem to have people queuing up to knock him down the moment he makes an error. 

For me, so far this season he's been our best player, giving a consistently high performance in every game.

627~~~
I disagree, he hasn't been our best player, he forms a real partnership with Smalling and they both have been the best part of our team.

628~~~
Jones and Rojo's lack of positioning, rashness and reading of the game compared to Blind will also cost us goals inevitably, we wont keep a clean sheet every match for the rest of the season, but the Smalling - Blind looks most promising until now, and there's no reason why LVG should change that at the moment.

629~~~
I think our fullbacks have been the most impressive of all the pairs. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

630~~~
They are more flashy but numerous times the fullbacks have left the center backs exposed. Darmian and Shaw have been excellent but Blind and Smalling have formed a consistent and calming base to our defense. At the moment we have a good back four and center backs are the main reason for it.

631~~~
Couldn't disagree more to be honest, from a defensive perspecitve they've both been excellent.

632~~~
They have been excellent but because they attack a lot, the defense has been exposed, I'm not criticizing them, they can't duplicate themselves.

633~~~
Rijkaard is well over 6 foot and strong. He had the physical attributes to play there. Blind does not. By the way, did you just compare Daley Blind to Frank Rijkaard? fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

LVG has a lot to prove. His tactics barely scraped top 4 last season and that was mainly due to Liverpool being shite. I agree that we are a better team now but we should be with the players we have signed. 

Anyway if you think playing one CB and CM beside him to do the passing is good tactics that's your business. Out of curiosity, would you play like that against good opposition? Say Barca?

You don't think he's slow and weak? You are actually arguing that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Nobody wants to knock him down. Blind is a good professional who will give his all wherever you play him. People just don't want to see him getting destroyed when he comes up against quality opposition who will exploit physical disadvantages that he can't really do anything about. He's done well so far and he'll be fine against most PL sides but against the better teams we will need two actual centre halves.

Look at it this way, if we came up against Real Madrid, Bayern or Barca and they had a Blind at CB would it not be something we would look to exploit? Of course it fecking would.

634~~~
Don't agree at all.

I think the whole defensive unit has been excellent.

The fullbacks have very rarely left the centrebacks exposed. The centrebacks have been able to play a high line as a result of the confidence in the fullback's ability to cover. The midfielders have offered protection through the centre and cut off the source of any potential passes in behind and the centrebacks have been confident enough to pass the ball out as a result of this cohesive unit.

635~~~
I never said that the all unit wasn't excellent, I actually said that they were all excellent, but by design our centre backs have to cover the fullbacks, that's what I said. For example, numerous times Blind has been in a foot race on the left side.

636~~~
Tell me Steve, do you know what the word 'exaggerate' means?  At no point have I argued that he is strong or quick,  I'm stating he isn't as slow or weak as many, including yourself are suggesting. He's won his physical duels with De Sutter, the same with Gestede (he even beat him in the air) and kept pace and pushed Obbi Oulare off the ball a couple of times in the first leg.
Lets actually watch the games and judge him on his performances, shall we?

637~~~
Is the condescension really necessary? 

We can revisit in a few months when we have a bigger sample of games to judge him on. My prediction is he won't be a good enough CB for us. Your prediction is?????

638~~~
Yes. 

Out of curiosity, would you play someone like Baresi?

639~~~
Na he's past it

640~~~
Smalling has been much better than blind and both fullbacks have been as well, some of the praise lavished on blind is way over the top. He has done well but he has been a bing fortunate quite a few times and has been very well protected which won't last much 
Offer.

It's too early to make a judgement on him yet because the opposition we have faced have all been poor going forward, tomorrow will probably be our first real test.

641~~~
Its been a decent start but people are too quick to lavish praise..It was the exact same thing last season with some people even going as far as to claim that he was much better than Carrick..the biggest fears in type of strikers that could theoretically trouble him in terms of speed and strength have yet to be faced..lets see how he gets on there..

642~~~
Blind isn't a slow centre half. I have no idea why this is continually repeated on here.

643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Can you say hypocrite?

I think he's good enough to play there, although I don't think many will ever change on their mind on him now, any sniff of a mistake and it'll be pounced upon, unless he is faultless he won't be good enough. 

I've given several example of when he's shown his physical attributes have stood up to the test,  aren't these proof it's wildly exaggerated?

644~~~
The difference is I have actually read your posts. You clearly hadn't read mine.

I hope you are wrong about people jumping on his mistakes. Its not his fault he had to play there and will be difficult enough without people getting on his back.

645~~~
Really? I think we've already established you hadn't read my original post properly,  hence your original misplaced bitchy comment. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>
Please, elaborate, what post of yours haven't I bothered to read? Specifics would be nice. You still haven't replied to my evidenced examples - what say you Steve?

646~~~
That menippean satire nonsense? 

I've already said I think he's done well so far. You want me to go trawling back to come up with specific examples of his lack of pace and strength? So I can prove a point to some stranger on an internet football. Sorry but no.

Just answer this question and we can revisit in a few months. Do you think he's good enough at CB to play against the top English and European teams?

647~~~
Yeah, don't understand something = nonsense. Got it.

No I was referring to the points I made, perhaps if you read my post properly you would've understand that. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
I think the fact I've mentioned my examples 3 times now and you'd totally ignored it says it all really though.

I think he's good enough in a system that suits him,  currently we are playing a system that suits him, so yes.

648~~~
Yep Blind is a brilliant ball player. Being small weak and slow has nothing to do with how good his passing is. Plus he's quite stong for his size anyway. Idk what more he can do to impress you as he has not conceded anything bar an own goal. Have some faith in your players

649~~~
This guy is fast becoming one of my favorite players
I miss his long hair though

650~~~
Same.  I wish he still had the bun.  Looked quite bad ass. 

If he is a long term CB then he will be my next shirt to buy!

651~~~
Not what I said.

652~~~
Can anyone supply any gifs of Blind against Oulare, Gestede and De Sutter? Would be great to have them to balance out the over exaggeration of Blinds weaknesses.

653~~~
Yeah, I remember that. Crazy stuff.
Anyway, he's done well. He seems to fit the defensive system (which is ultimately what it's about). Little to complain about thus far.

654~~~
I think one of the main issues we've got is set pieces when we play a team with three or four stronger players. A bit like Darmian marking Richards against Villa. 

On the plus side Blind hasn't really put a foot wrong so far this season. I'm not sure Rojo would even be too much of an upgrade when he's fit. Maybe he's a bit stronger and faster, but a lot more potential to make a mistake. 

I'm sure no matter how many good games Blind has, as soon as he makes a mistake everyone will be baying for blood.

655~~~
You said he wasn't a good ball player?

656~~~
The bun was atrocious! Now he only need to lose the beard and it's grand <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

657~~~
Again not what I said. I said he wasn't a brilliant ball player.

658~~~
We don't need him to be Xavi or scholes level. He is better than 90% of the CBs in PL and certainly better than everyone in our team. And his defending is good too. Intercepts well, positioning is good and good tackler. Together it's a good combination to have

659~~~
What Blind lacks physically he compensates with his quick thinking and tactical knowledge of the game.

660~~~
Not convinced by him but hopefully he does well again today. We're set up quite solidly so think it should be fine assuming Smalling takes care of Gomis.

661~~~
You don't say...

662~~~
Struggling against gomis. Their best chances came through errors from blind.

He is a great option to have but I still see Jones and Smalling as our longterm centreback partnership. If only Jones can stay injury free.

663~~~
GNev criticising Blind a bit - saying it was like when he himself struggled to play CB.

664~~~
No, we should have signed Ottamendi

665~~~
Yeah its nonsense, I mean the first clip they showed was the dink over the top, it had absolutely nothing to do with pace or strength but it suited their story.

666~~~
Struggled?.. my stream was cutting out a bit but didn't Gomis tear him apart just the once.. Gomis can do that to anyone?

667~~~
Having a bit of a rough one today. Seems like Gomis is really targeting him too.

668~~~
Few examples in that half. Smalling helping him as much as possible but every time it's him and Gomis he's getting destroyed. Culpable for three of Swansea's best chances. Thankfully we've got away with it. As Neville said at half time speaking from his own experience playing CB, you can know the position inside out but without the physical attributes it can be a major struggle. 

On the positive he passed it very well and read one situation with Ayew beautifully. But in the end he could have cost us three goals if their finishing had been better.

669~~~
No he wasn't, a ball over top doesn't constitute as a chance,  the sig chance was a mess,  the ball could've gone anywhere,  was beaten well by Gomis for the 3rd.

As predicted any sniff of a possible mistake and it's blown out of proportion.

670~~~
You're kidding. Nev and Carragher spent all of half time talking about it. Try to stay objective here.

671~~~
Well if they were talking about it it must be true. They mentioned before the game that Gomis was going to tag onto Blind, why on earth would they try to vindicate themselves?!

That header was scored off the back of Smalling, was that due to his physical limitations?

672~~~
Obviously not. Whats wrong with you???

673~~~
It's very hard to get a point across to you isn't it? You seem to misunderstand pretty much everything.

674~~~
way too slow to cover the back of his fullback.

675~~~
I'm finished discussing this with you. There's just no point

676~~~
Thats a relief, I could feel myself getting stupid.

677~~~
Gomis made things difficult for Blind in the first half, sure. He also made things difficult for Smalling in the second half, outpacing him for his goal. If that had happened to Blind you would never hear the end of it but the fact it happened to our fastest defender shows that pace and power really isn't the answer to everything. Likewise for Ayew's goal. If Blind had missed the header the knives would be out, but because it:s Smalling it's just a small error from a ruthless counterattack.

Absolutely 100% guaranteed this game will be referred to as the game when Blind was found out when it was his unbeatable partner for both goals

678~~~
His fullback was on the otherside of the pitch.  Both goals.

679~~~
Where the feck were our 'defensive midfielders' or any midfielders? Depay was fecking lazy to track back, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin both gone missing.

680~~~
A truly terrible performance from Blind. I thought he lost his nerve completely. Of course he struggled against Gomis' power and turn of pace but you'd hope his positioning would limit the damage. The only surprising thing was that neither goal was particularly his fault.

681~~~
Then why is it a terrible performance?

682~~~
It is what it is, when he gets isolated by a big powerful #9 he'll have these issues and we didn't protect him well enough. I think in a game like this we'd have played Rojo if he was fit, that's the point of a squad even though as a rule you wouldn't want tinker with your back 4 if you don't need to.

683~~~
Wasn't a particularly great performance, wasnt terrible either. He wasn't bullied by Gomis like some were expecting. Got beaten by an excellent turn in the first half but other than that he was rarely outmuscled.

684~~~
Surely that's normal when Smalling has already proven himself to be a very good centre back. Its Blinds 3rd best position and he hasn't played there much so obviously people will have doubts about him there.

Blind gave the performance you would logically expect him to give in that situation. Its no slight on him. I just think today was asking a bit too much from a player of his type playing in that position.

Don't think anyone is saying pace and power are the only attributes required either but they are obviously useful against someone like Gomis. If Rojo or Jones had been fit they would have been more suited to the task and we would have had a better chance of keeping them out.

That's not a criticism of Blind. Its just common sense. He is after all a midfielder/left back as opposed to a specialist central defender. I think against a partnership like Ayew and Gomis you need two proper CBs

685~~~
I have no idea how you can say that when Blind's lack of pace or power had literally nothing to do with the goals we conceded, and the player with the most pace, power and height was powerless to keep them out on both occasions?

686~~~
I don't quite get this. Blind should be exempt from judgement because his mistakes didn't lead to goals? I'm giving the opinion we would be more solid with two specialist centre halves who could match up with the likes of Gomis. Its not a crazy thing to say. 

I never said Blind was at fault for the goals <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

687~~~
He's been banging on about this for days and quoted me out of the blue as some kind of vindication at half time. He's previously said his positioning sense and intellectual aspects of the game are fine but he can't play there because he isn't strong or fast. As you said despite the fact the goals had nothing to do with his lack of physicality the fact we conceded two and Gomis scores some how proves him right...

688~~~
There was only one occasion where Blind's lack of pace and power was exposed and that was when Gomis hit the post, and in the very same move Smalling was left on his arse by Gomis which shows that even if you have the pace to stop him he can be very difficult to deal with. Surely if it was something that is so easily exploited then they would've just targeted him the whole game and ultimately created chances from it? In reality they exposed our defensive disorganisation and poor tracking of runners on both occasions. Blind is better at that than Jones and a lot better than Rojo, so I can only see them leaving us more exposed not less so.

I just think people overstate the importance of individual physical attributes when more often than not it's defensive disorganisation - through poor positioning, communication or just overall reading of the game - that leads to chances being created, and Blind is very good at that side of things. He has his weaknesses no doubt but I'm just saying that those weaknesses are less important than Rojo's weaknesses, for example, but it's far easier to point to physical traits than mental traits and this whole "pace and power" image that the PL is famed for is so prevalent that people worry far more about the former.

There's also that thing about it being his 3rd position. I don't agree at all. In a possession-based team he's much better in defence than in midfield and I'm not convinced he's any better at left back than he is at centre back. People refused to accept Blind could ever be a good left back in the PL for the exact same reasons they're saying he can't be a good centre back which is what I find really odd. They eventually accepted he is in fact a good left back - proving his lack of pace wasn't that easy to take advantage of despite it unquestionably being more exposed on the wing - and the strengths he showed out there - his organisational qualities, positioning and overall reading of the game - are utilised far more often in the centre, but that gets ignored completely while people regurgitate the same argument all over again.

689~~~
Even if we go out and get a CB; i still think Blind can be a fantastic CB for us with practise.

690~~~
Ok. I take it you also feel he will be a good CB for us. I don't. We've covered the physical part. I'm also still not fully convinced that his positioning, organising etc is as good as people keep saying. He looks to me like he's still figuring the position out. Anyway hopefully you're right and he will be a success at CB. Personally I'd be surprised. I don't think he has the tools. 

Alex Ferguson said if Gary Neville was a few inches taller he'd be the best centre half in Britain. But he wasn't so he ended up at right back. He did ok at CB on the odd time he played there but was never going to be a Ferdinand or a Vidic. All the systems in the world wouldn't have made him a good enough centre half for United. I feel the same about Blind.

For what it's worth I agree on Rojo to a fair extent. He's all over the place. He isn't a good centre half. I think Jones can be though.

691~~~
Because he is Blind and something has to be wrong with him. He came from Eredivisie.

He was actually not that bad today.

692~~~
When thin on protection from LB and two DMs, he looks very vulnerable. Not even worth mentioning that he's not going to be a world class CB just because LvG decided to try him there. Every time team gets behind our two DMs, its either full-backs or Smalling who are the saving grace. Blind just looks caught up and then jogs back to defend the space. Is he worth the risk at CB considering his vulnerabilities just for his passing?

693~~~
Couldn't agree more. I'd say Blind would have been in an ideal position to defend both goals had our fullbacks also been in position, Smalling too. We were caught out by a counter attack when both full backs were far too advanced and Rooney carelessly and needlessly gave the ball away, and by an exceptional ball and run when I believe Shaw was again out of position (which can be forgiven as he was our only attacking threat and was up and down that flank all game). It appears that some people just have this initial opinion of Blind and can't see past it (pun there somewhere), he's been a revelation at centre back in my opinion.

694~~~
I quoted you because you'd been asking for examples of his struggling against a powerful striker.

I've actually never really commented too much on his positioning or intellectual aspects of his game. Please don't put words in my mouth

What I find frustrating is you act like I've some sort of agenda here. It's an opinion. An opinion that Neville and Carragher clearly shared in their halftime analysis. I'm not for a second saying their word is gospel but they both had long careers as defenders for big clubs. They both have champions league medals ffs. Do they have some sort of weird agenda against him too?

Clearly it's just the world vs Daley Blind here. How else could so many people possibly cast doubts on the man's brilliance as a centre half?

Edit: Just noticed the last part of you're post. Where did you get that from? I quoted you at half time. Gomis scored in the second half. I never made any comment about Gomis' goal in relation to Blind. It hadn't even happened yet.

695~~~
Dalye blind when out of position has normally read the danger before anyone else.

696~~~
I've seen this a fair bit too actually. But all I've been reading is how great his positioning is. 

Not to be too harsh on the lad though. He's doing well enough in the circumstances. I genuinely think people are trying to be too clever and failing to see the obvious. I fully expect in a years time for Blind to no longer been seen as a CB and people to look back on it as just another one of LVG's odd little experiments.

697~~~
His positioning may be great or the best ever but with the way we play having a high line, without good recovery pace which both Jones and Rojo possess, he is going to give initiative to opponent ST. He's not a physical player either which Rojo and Jones are, and which I think is necessary to be a defender. Carrick was just as smarter and just as physical as Blind and he'd have some poor games at CB. We didn't have caftards wishing for him to play at CB with Jones being sold. No difference with Blind. He can do a job but he's not a CB.

698~~~
He's short and slow. We want quick, speedy players with pace and height.

699~~~
And ypu refused to give me any. the examples you eventually gave had absolutely nothing to do with physicality as has been pointed out to you by myself and others. He didn't struggle physically against him and yet you're still banging on about it.

700~~~
i did that remark after the first goal... Blind instead of rushing out to prevent the cross, was found out in the middle of the ball's way, marking no one, and offering no pressure to the ball's carrier. 

So yeah, he was slow, both physically and mentally to react to that situation. Shaw had nothing to do with it because he was just participating in a very good attack play, which resulted in a very fast counter attack, so zero blame to him. 

I agree our midfield (specially 40yo Schweinsteiger) failed miserably to give him cover, and yeah, Depay is a primadonna. 

Still, CB is never going to be his position (not in our league at least), and as soon Jones or Rojo are fit, he wont play any more there (hopefully). His passing is nice when he has space, but we shouldn't be relying on our CBs to start our football. specially with the midfield we have). Their primary mission should be defend our goal.

701~~~
He struggled a bit with Gomis at times. He wasn't awful or anything, but he did have some issues.

702~~~
Think it would be much better if he was right footed and Mike left,Darmian is better when it comes to defending and sense of position then Shaw,Shaw going forward is great but sometimes he is giving Blind more trouble then Darmian on other side imo.

703~~~
Weird for anyone to say Blind was "found out" yesterday. Everyone knows he lacks strength/pace, hes an intelligent player who can pass really well thats why LvG wants him at CB because I guess thats what he expects from a CB.

704~~~
This Abe Lincoln beard has to go.

I like it!

708~~~
That article sounds like some pretentious feck just ate a dictionary for breakfast.

709~~~
What a horribly constructed article. I flow better when I'm constapated.

710~~~
Big test today. Not just because he's up against a striker that has physically dominated Smalling before, but also because they're up against two strikers for the first (?) time all season. He can't just let Smalling mark the striker while he sweeps up in behind. Should be interesting.

711~~~
Well from what I've seen so far as well as early this season, looks like I'll have to hold my hands up here. Blind is doing very well. Hopefully I don't jinx him...

712~~~
Bentekkers in his pocket.

Super Daley Blind.

713~~~
FOR SHAME YOU CNUTS! FOR SHAME.

716~~~
Today's hero without a doubt.

717~~~
Just close the vote. He's the man of the match.

718~~~
He was good last year considering he played in different positions, though he was more consistently used in the LB role near the end.  However, I have to say I doubted him completely and his new role.  The couple times he has completely out-muscled Benteke was very impressive as well.  Still might go sour at one point in the season, but he has been a revelation.  Martial to get the headlines, but Blind continues to impress in his new role

719~~~
Fecking wonderful. A straight 10.

720~~~
Amazing. Absolute class tonight.

721~~~
What a hero today! 2 important clearances and scored our first goal too, MOTM without a doubt. Brilliant performance and overall very good at CB so far.

722~~~
Still worried?

723~~~
Yeah but just wait until he plays against a world class striker. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Brilliant goal and he has been great all season.

724~~~
I swear I was watching Danny Blind today.

That intelligence and responsibility...

725~~~
His general football 'know-how' is great. It's not just intelligence in terms of reading the game and positioning accordingly or his use of the ball - but knowing exactly what to do in each situation. Whether it be taking a player wide, pressing them or giving them a nudge.

It's what you expect of a 30 year old who has played the same position all his career. Not a versatile 25 year old.

726~~~
Excellent performance.

727~~~
Fantastic game.

728~~~
Very very good performance, even without the goal. It was clear that Benteke tried to target him but he did very well

729~~~
Great performance from him and the whole defence today.

730~~~
LVGs best signing

731~~~
This guy is terrific to watch. Intelligence personified.

732~~~
Curious on how many people that will be humble enough to apologize at the end of the season.

733~~~
He's fantastic. Good LB, good CB, decent CM.

734~~~
It was like watching Dream Team again where the whole match focuses on one player dominating every aspect that they can throw him into. Glorious. A straight 10. If anyone gives less, I'd love to know why.

735~~~
Bastian.

Blind finished the ball brilliant. Don't know why they allowed him to get his shot off unmarked. Brilliant at the back too. MotM for me.

736~~~
Did absolutely brilliantly today. Wish he had a clean sheet but there was no stopping that Benteke goal.

737~~~
Bossed it big time

738~~~
He's been a revelation this season. He's been solid, intelligent, classy and gutsy. Have to say I didn't expect this level from him at centre back he's done very well. Long may it continue. I don't see Jones getting back in easily if Blind keeps this up.

739~~~
made up for him today! he's been underrated. especially when I read Rio in the week calling him the weak link. 

MOTM without a doubt today.

740~~~
Replay showed that Schweinsteiger stood in between Mata and Blind and made a run dragging the defender with him.

741~~~
Even still, it was obvious that's who they were playing it too. Neville even called it before Mata hit it. Superb finish from Blind though.

742~~~
Needs to be given the plaudits for his goal. I think most people will think it's piss easy to slot that into the corner but it really isn't with so many players in the box.

The brain of our team. That's why Van Gaal plays him.

Him and Smalling are awesome together.

743~~~
Best solo performance we've had this season and possibly last season too, saved us twice, scored a goal, played wonderfully.

744~~~
Carrick, He and BFS makes a very good intelligent core of the team tbh.

745~~~
Clyne was zone marking the area but schweini made a run that pulled him away leaving gap for blind to do his thing

746~~~
best game for Daley in our jersey, who would have thought he could be this good as CB. Keep it up, slowly starting to believe he can be the man for Smalling

747~~~
Predicted in the unpopular opinions thread that he's going to be our best defensive player this season. He's very bright and confident, would make a great captain.

748~~~
Absolutely brilliant today I am glad he is proving that my doubts were unfounded, such an intelligent player.

749~~~
Me. Haha. Only in this set up though, there's a lot of pace and strength around him and everyone compliments each other defensively right now.

750~~~
Yes

751~~~
Unless Beneke shanked him in the tunnel after the game you dont really have a point, Blind dominated him.

752~~~
According to "Sky Sports Statto":

80 touches
4 tackles
9 clearances
86.4% passing accuracy
10.39km covered

753~~~
feck that, I'll do it now, he struggled with Gomis in the last game but in every other game he has been good to excellent and was 10/10 for me today, if he can win with brain vs brawn 95% of the time we'll be fine as he has beasts either side of him with Smalling and Shaw.

754~~~
That goal was not that easy but he did brilliantly. Well deserved

755~~~
He was poor against Swansea but once the team works well and he's on top of it, he's very good. We have to see over the next couple of months if that Swansea game was a one off (like many CBs have) and if he can keep up this good form

756~~~
I am believer now. He should be our first choice CB alongside with Smalling this season, without a doubt.

757~~~
What an imagination.

758~~~
Thanks.

759~~~
See there never was a problem. 

1. He isn't slow as what some of you guys were saying. 
2. He isnt particularly weak. 
3. Any hindrances are helped by his reading of the game. 

Yhe Absolute best thing about him is that relatively speaking this is his 1st yr as a Cb and he can only improve. 

For all the fans who said 3 out of our 4 defenders were the best in the league; get used to it being 4/4.

760~~~
I'm sure this has being posted umpteen times but what in the absolute feck is the person smoking who controls the Adidas twitter account.

761~~~
No need for that kind of talk. I wonder if you would say the same if Benteke was white

762~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

763~~~
He has his limitations but it is  absolutely great to have an intelligent CB who is very unlikely to have a brainfade. I actually like Jones but I am genuinely starting to think that Blind may have issues with pace but just imagine how much more likely Jones and Rojo are to having brainfades

764~~~
Oh btw that moment when he eased Benteke off the ball was pretty cool

765~~~
White text? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

766~~~
What the feck is that?

767~~~
Lol I thought it was an obvious joke

768~~~
Yeah but wait until he plays against a physical playe..... Oh wait.

769~~~
My bad! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

You never know though.. with the whole PC thing.

770~~~
Cannot get over that finish. Excellent game from him.

771~~~
Wait, what?!?!?

772~~~
I have been hugely impressed by him at CB. Must be honest Start of the season I was concerned but he is just a clever footballer. Has done brilliantly so far

773~~~
I like how he steps into midfield to look for a pass. They should really be pressing him when he does that, though.

What ... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

774~~~
With our two DMs also around, it is probably very difficult to press him overly because he can pass under pressure too.

775~~~
Handsomer Maldini today, basically

776~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">Fantastic defensive performance from him today, he was everywhere and so passionate and committed too.  The fantastic goal was the cherry on top:  easily the Man of the Match.  

Is Blind the world class ball playing centre back we were all yearning for over the summer?  His performances this season as centre back have been outstanding.  His positioning is first class, he can tackle and any lack of pace is compensated by his excellent reading of the game.  Now he has De Gea behind him, Smalling next to him and 2XSch and Carrick in front, he could develop himself into a top top defender, reminds me bit of Ronny Jonson or Lilian Thuram.  

Fantastic signing from LVG who deserves the main credit for identifying and bringing him in.</span>

777~~~
Was 'bout to post it, what the feck.

778~~~
Proper footballer. He's a bit like Lahm in a way. His football intelligence means he can play a lot of roles and still out in top performances.

779~~~
He was top class today, I think Jones will struggle to get back into the side if he carries on like this.

780~~~
Probably our best performer of our season. Not been found in defence as of yet but has all the attributes of a creative player, yet playing in defence.

Long may it continue. I'm not too sure if if is just a run, or he is genuinely built for this position in our set up. Hopefully the former.

781~~~
John who?

782~~~
You could probably say that about any of our back 4, which is really pleasing after a few seasons of dire defending. That we've had complete stability in those defensive positions is absolutely massive.

783~~~
I wonder how much he's worth right now. I bet every manager would kill for a player like him. LB, CB, midfield. Fantastic buy, and one of my favorite players right now. 

I wonder if he could be taking free kicks? He's got beautiful left foot.

784~~~
There is a strong case between Shaw, Blind and Smalling for being our best players so far . I would accept any argument for either really, although I think Blind  deserves a bit extra as he is being asked to do a job which he isn't necessarily accustomed to.

785~~~
He's pretty effective player, isn't he? I don't think his values has risen too much to what we paid for him though. He still has same obvious weakness and same strengths.

786~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZgaTnHTrGU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

787~~~
Probably our best individual performance of the season. If you as a defender don't put a foot wrong defensively, including clearing the ball of the line and in addition scoring a great goal - that is a 9/10 performance.

788~~~
Guys, we need to talk about that adidas ad

789~~~
Not so sure what to think about the ad, but dolphins are intelligent animal. So, I guess, based on the ad, the dolphin was everywhere on the pitch. Same like Blind, who is pretty evident by now, is more of intelligence rather than physical type player, and can play in different positions? Who knows, the ad is still bizarre. Break expectations indeed.

790~~~
Whats clear is that he has a great understanding and reading of play.

Something people criticized him for last season in midfield

791~~~
People said his understanding of play was a problem? News to me

Last season my opinion was that he was too weak and didn't have the passing range we needed for a DM. I really didn't expect him to become such a fantastic CB

792~~~
Yes, they complained that he was going too far forward and pressing at the wrong time. Two specific things I can remember

793~~~
I actually remember the complaints against him pressing too forward so fair enough. Sorry for that!

I never thought of him as a good enough DM for United but his CB play has been exceptional so far. LVG has Schweinsteigered him maybe?

794~~~
I still have my doubts about Blind at centre half long term, but overall he's sure proving me (and plenty others) wrong!  I really thought this was a game in which he might get found out, going up against a big, physical, pacey striker. However, he was just brilliant today. It really is impressive how well he compensates for some of his shortcomings with his intelligence. As Rio would say, long may it continue!

795~~~
People act differently on computers don't they.

796~~~
Absolutely making me eat my words. He's been fantastic so far this season at CB.

The understanding between him and Smalling has been very very good.

797~~~
The one thing he lacks is the pace and probably a bit of a drive too which is I think why he's better played at CB than as a DM/LB. Boy has he been excellent this season so far! Not many would have disagreed with the OP, but how he turned it around is amazing!

798~~~
LvG has basically done to Blind what he did with Schweinsteiger at Bayern. Classy player.

799~~~
Unlike so many of our (now former) players, he has really taken hold of his opportunity for playing time and locked down his position. It's astonishing. He's played every minute (?) of the season, most of it protecting a substandard keeper, with very few errors and some big contributions. I expected he would be squeezed out by our new midfield signings but he has jumped ahead of more expensive and established players at a new position.

I guess this is classic LvG. When it works, it's brilliant, right?

800~~~
What a performance by the dutchmaster! Absolutely immense at the back and kept Benteke quiet. I had thought before the game it would be Smalling but Blind was exceptional against Benteke. He is such an intelligent footballer to have at the back. Hope he continues to grow in his new role. Also, a beautifully taken goal. Absolutely caressed that ball in the corner.

801~~~
That goal reminded me of Vidic's curler against Villa. Curl and power!

802~~~
But can he defend against Hazard and Costa who love running at players, Silva and Aguero who does the same or Arsenal mids when they overlap the attack? Until he does well against those teams, I think the jury is still out on him. I am still not convinced by his one on one defending and his lack of pace allows some players to escape his attention quite easily. Its not to say he hasn't been good for us so far but like the season review, its too early to say its a brilliant move by LvG.

803~~~
Pace is overrated.  Defender will always have an edge due to them having to defend instead of running with the ball, can easilly be overcome with intelligence and good reading of the game.  Besides when people say a player is lacking pace they make it sounds like he's 80 years old.  Both him and mata can still run very fast, faster than everyone on the caf still

804~~~
Perhaps. But it'd be little more reassuring if he had a good recovery pace to rely upon in case he make mistakes. Not saying he's prone to making mistakes either, just he sometimes doesn't look great when being one-on-one on inside left channel. He's a classy player though, has clean passing and shooting and also doesn't shy from dirty work. I am not afraid of him being physically bullied though, I think he is very intelligent in direct confrontation and doesn't get beaten often. Just a little more proof of he in defence is working (perhaps by the end of this year) before I become assured of him being in our defense makes the team defend better rather than the defence accommodating him due to his good passing and intelligence.

805~~~
Im sure van gaal noted that.  He might get found out in a flat 442 but we have 2dm in most game covering for pacey luke shaw and darmian is solid,  so imo it should be enough for him. His net contribution to the team is worth the handicap. 

His lack of pace might cost us a few goals.  But he'll earn us points so it's good enough at the end of the day.  Besides we don't have someone who's head and shoulders better than him...  

We'll see i guess

806~~~
Before this match there were doubts about his strength and how he will cope against Benteke. Now that he kept Benteke in his pocket, people are raising doubts about his other attributes. 

Its funny how people on here make negative impressions about a player just on one match and yet it takes several matches to create positive impressions.

807~~~
Like father, like son?
Pretty good at centreback aye

808~~~
His father in his Ajax days would start at defence but would be everywhere while attacking though. He's be putting crosses in, running in from the deep, doing everything while also being a very reliable defender. If he can be as good as his father consistently, he'd be a real gem for us.

809~~~
Of course. I am going to wait at least till the end of this year before thinking he's going to be a good enough defender for Man United or not (consistently). I never said he's played badly for us, I am still nervous about him because this is a little bit of unfamiliar territory for me seeing him as a CB. I have never said anything bad about his performance, just said need a longer period of time to see how he grows defensively. I don't think that's an unfair way to evaluate a player.

810~~~
I never believed I would say this, but Blind looks like a good central defender... During preseason I poster several times in the newbie forum about how he would never been good enough, too slow, too small, too weak... He has proven me wrong in every game that really matters. He seems to have a football intelligence that surpasses everyone, the way he learns new positions and develops his play is astonishing. He's a player that really get the max out of limited physical talents. It seems we can put him anywhere on the field, give him some time and he will learn the position and do it well

Call me impressed

811~~~
This guy is exceeding expectations at CB. Not sure which was better the goal or his clearance but both were crucial.

812~~~
I really like Blind, but didn't like the idea of him at CB.  But, I have to say - he is doing a great job of it.

813~~~
On the caf people have agendas that they never let go of. Young had a good season, yet for some he didn't deserve a new contract. Blind has done very very well this season & sections of our fans will simply look for negatives over any positives. Blind, Rooney, Young, Fellaini & Valencia are rarely going to get praised on here. The herd mentality won't allow it, they make 1 error or dare not to perform exceptionally & the drama will commence. Where as Mata & Herrera.....

814~~~
Just the fact that he is comfortable playing in so many positions make him extremely valuable. Hes like a better O'Shea

I really wonder what he will end up playing as long term. So far hes put in really good performances at DM, LB and now CB

815~~~
I keep saying it, but Blind was a bloody great signing. You so need these type of reliable versatile players in a squad. Very clever signing.

816~~~
Great clearance off the line. Took his goal very well also. Thought he was man of the match but more so because the first goal was a big moment for us.

817~~~
Blind at centre half has been a revelation. He won several contests with big Benteke yesterday. Amazing. I had little to no faith in him succeeding in this role, but he's proving that defending runs in the family. Should he keep this up someday people may ask who was the better centre back, Daley or Danny?

818~~~
It's all team work, what Louis calls collective responsibility, if the team plays well then his weaknesses aren't exposed because the others help him out, Shaw, Blind, Smalling, Darmian, Schweinsteiger and Carrick all do their bit and help each other out when they need too.

Even at left back Blind played well because he, Young and Fellaini combined well, that's also why both Young and Fellaini played well (last season in some games).

Just as our defence looks solid so can our attack, the manager needs to find the right combination in the attacking third. When Louis van Gaal attacks well but his defence leaks then he is called an attacking coach who can't defend, when his defence plays well but his attack isn't threatening in the final third he is called a defensive coach who plays boring football.

He looks for balance, if his defensive organisation is praised I don't get why the same posters complain about our attack, surely he'll figure that out too and it's just a matter of time? It's understandably not easy as we lack that world class player, defensively we also don't have it but the team work has made up for it, offensively we also need the combination and chemistry of the attacking four to work in a way the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

The change with Young yesterday acted like a catalyst, his willingness to try and beat a man helped us raise our tempo when the ball got to the final third, it's that sudden change in attacking tempo and switches of play that Louis van Gaal uses to attack, once the team works well in the final third the attack can be as effective as the defence.

This is something good from Louis van Gaal's methods, we saw it with Netherlands at the world cup, good players in a strongly team oriented system can be more effective and perform to a great level, if Giggs is the next manager then I hope he learns a lot on this, as Louis has done with players in the past he will give freedom for individual brilliance if the player is capable of it consistently (e.g. Robben) but when you have players that can't do that such as Blind, Young, Fellaini (weaknesses for their position meaning they are only good players) then you need the players around them to work together.

819~~~
What a great <span style="text-decoration: line-through">squad</span> player this guy is. Love him.

820~~~
Please just stop calling him slow.  It drives me nuts.  This is a LB who is playing at CB; how could he possibly be slow?  Alright he isn't fast as koscienly; but he isnt slow as half the central defenders in the league. 

Not only that; why does he have to be fast when his passing is fantastic and we keep the ball for the majority of the game?

821~~~
What a dour human being you are. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

822~~~
Blind will eventually end up replacing Carrick.

823~~~
<a class="username" data-user="54053, @MichaelKorleone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54053/">@MichaelKorleone</a> found a clip of us trying the exact same move against Arsenal last year when Blind almost scored again. Herrera took the Schweinsteiger role of blocking off the man. It is quite a nice move.

PVS warning to Blind.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/de-mos-warns-daley-blind-that-he-will-not-enjoy-freedom-against-psv/462056" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/de-mos-...-he-will-not-enjoy-freedom-against-psv/462056</a>

825~~~
what are you onto? Commenting quality of human being? I am reserving my judgement for Blind, that is not being dour, that is being reasonable.

826~~~
Don't know if this has already been mentioned but during the American telecast of our game with Liverpool, Lee Dixon said that he spoke with Roy Keane recently and he told him that United would never win anything with Daley Blind as their CB.  This, along with Rio's recent comments is a bit puzzling especially in light of Blind's recent performances.  Still early days, but I"m much more concerned about our striker situation than I am about Blind as our CB.

827~~~
If the jury comes in and it turns out he had Hazard, Costa, Silva, and Aguero in his pocket, then he would have turned out to be one of the greatest defenders of his generation. Which he probably is not, so let's just give him his due now as a surprisingly good centreback.

828~~~
I can see this happening aswell

829~~~
He was good last season as well considering it was his debut season but certain fans went overboard after the last 5-6 games and made him out to be a scapegoat, forgetting the rest of the season. It's funny how many people said he would struggle to get a game this year too.

830~~~
Tbf most people were still evaluating him at that holding midfielder position and he isn't good enough to displace any of our options there. He's been much better at centre-half than Rojo ever was last year though, so I hope he keeps his spot.

831~~~
Some people speak as if Rio, Vidic, Bruce, Pallister have never been beaten by any striker ever. 

So what if Blind may not be great against Aguero or Costa? He's doing a good job nevertheless.

832~~~
You know what the difference is? They were defenders. Blind is in defense not just because of his general player but because he wouldn't get in our midfield.

833~~~
He covered for Shaw in defense last season (and even played CB in one game). He's as much a defender as midfielder.

834~~~
Running out of superlatives for this guy, it appears that Louie knew what he was doing when he started the Blind experiment during pre-season. Can you believe it?!

835~~~
Wow great spot that, it's clearly something we've had planned for a while. It amazes me that more strategic corners/freekicks aren't used in football, it really could make a huge difference to have a "hockey style" freekick/penalty corner. Everybody just expects the ball to be flung into the box, but as that goal shows sometimes it's as easy as making a 10 yard sideways pass.

836~~~
Our defense is looking very good.

837~~~
Love is Blind.

838~~~
Blind isnt good enough to play holding for us, but I wonder is Schneiderlin that much better? Schneiderlin is a better ballstopper but Blind is netter tactically and better on the ball. Is the difference that big? Blind also played in a 4141 formation instead of the 4231, which offers far more protection and is less offensive.

839~~~
I like Blind as a player irrespective of where he plays because he has a great understanding of the game, solid technique and a calm demeanour. He had a few sub-par games last season but we had a habit of leaving him woefully exposed both with and without the ball when he played DM.

His biggest positive in relation to our other CB's is that you know exactly what you are going to get from him. Sure he has areas that can be considered weaker than the ideal CB but he consistently delivers on his strengths. His rivals (Rojo and Jones) may well be more suitable defenders when they are on top of their game, although though this will be increasingly up for debate as he fully adapts to the role, but you can't be sure what you will get from one game to the next with them. You can easily drill the team to compensate for Blind's weaknesses as they don't vary from week to week, with Jones he can go from sublime to ridiculous (and visa versa) within the same phase of play and it is impossible to mitigate such instances because they are so random.

Reliability and temperament are often under-rated qualities and Blind delivers both in abundance, it is a relatively new role for him so we should all be excited about how good he can be when he has sufficient time to master it.

840~~~
Looked great so far, fair play to him, didnt think it would work. Although, he looked bad against Gomis. I expected him to get bullied more often, but seems to be a rarity.

841~~~
I think is the other way around. In the 4-1-4-1 he's the only defensive midfielder. The other two were either out and out attacking midfielders (Di Maria & Herrera) or Fellaini and Herrera which probably afforded a bit more protection but playing alongside someone like Scheniderlin would make it much more easy for him.

I however do not wish to move him out of defense though, I think a large part of the shape and organization we have there right now is down to him. People commented a lot about how Smalling has helped him but I think it also works the other way around by Blind being the most vocal of the back 6 if you include the DM ahead of him and the keeper to keep everyone in line. Its almost like having a defensive coach out on the field.

842~~~
For all the flack O'Shea got, he was capable of delivering consistent 7.5/10 performances anywhere on the pitch. Blind has his moments but I wouldn't say he's <i>much </i>better than prime O'Shea. 

They both have a knack for getting important goals though. O'Shea against Liverpool in '07 and Arsenal at home in '09, and Blind against West Ham last season, and Liverpool this season. 

Typing that just made me realize Blind may be my favorite player right now.

843~~~
Get in line mate!

844~~~
For all the criticism LVG got for some of his decisions it seems putting Blind to CB was a right one. 
Credit where credit is due.

845~~~
Yes it's been a good call, though you could make a question out of it - why TF did you not try it last season?

846~~~
Because we lacked a proper pre-season and the only way geyting througg to understanding the team and vice versa was to play a similar way to how the Netherlands played in the world cup.  3 at the bavk etc.

847~~~
Carrick injuries, Shaw injuries and you have to work that for months.

848~~~
We didn't have Schneiderlin or Schweinsteiger to cover in midfield and Shaw was injured most of the season. Although I'm pretty sure Blind did cover at CB for the game against Palace at Old Trafford.

849~~~
Yes, accept that, especially the lack of options in midfield. But we had ridiculous chopping and changing at the back and it would have helped a lot I think.

850~~~
Also the parts where Blind may get exposed as a centre back are minimised with the increased protection our defence now has, wouldn't have been possible with last seasons midfield I don't think.

851~~~
Is there a player in the league who is more monitored than Blind right now? He's under a microscope and any inkling on a mistake will be blown out of proportion.  He has been condemned as a failure by many before he even kicked a ball at centreback. When you consider that he's done amazingly well to deal with pressure.

852~~~
We're lucky to have a player like Daley who can slide over to left back and then provide a beautiful pass for the opening goal. He may not look like a prototypical center half but I have to respect his contribution to all phases of the game and his positional versatility.

853~~~
In love with Daley <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a pass. He's absolutely brilliant.

854~~~
We need him at CB; our defence looks shambles with rojo.  No calmness that blind brings to the game.

855~~~
Defence gone to pieces without him. Young or rojo left back?

856~~~
Sinse we have to play the whole season without shaw; i'd think darmian at LB and valencia at RB is better.

857~~~
He was wank.

858~~~
Not great for their first goal, If you know you're not going to get a good connection on that, then you're better of letting your keeper/bloke on the line deal with it.

Still, I was a bit fecked off that we moved him to Left Back... where's the logic there? Why split up your CB pairing that's been excellent all season? makes no sense.

859~~~
His header on their 1st goal was one of those reflex moments, other than that he played pretty well IMO but personally I'd keep him at LCB and use Rojo at LB.

860~~~
Good pass for the goal. Very surprised he wasn't kept at CB though and Rojo LB.

861~~~
He was fine at centre half tonight but then when he switched to left back it all went to pot for him. Based on tonight I'm hoping for the next match he'll put Rojo at left back.

862~~~
Absolute mismatch against Pelle. If he goes through the second half without conceding it'll be something

863~~~
Getting zero protection from Carrick, you isolate Blind and he will struggle, infact most defenders would.

864~~~
He needs protection from his midfield

865~~~
Said it before and say it again, he shouldn't play centre back in away matches.

866~~~
What difference does it make which stadium he plays at?

867~~~
We normally have 70% possession at home we have little to do. Away from home we have more pressure on us naturally being the away team, Swansea and today are good examples.

868~~~
That left hand side was a disaster. It got bullied. Both Rojo and Blind were poor.

869~~~
Unsurprisingly, Pelle dominated him until he moved to Smalling's side, for some reason. These forwards will continue to do that.

870~~~
Pelle had him for size and strength, Mane had him for pace.

They had a right go at Blind today, and he looked shaky.

871~~~
Yeah. Exploited him today. Looked lost. Mane was too tricky for him, wasn't about pace for me.

872~~~
Should have swapped positions with Smalling.

873~~~
Unfortunately we'll see more of this when Blind is up against pace and power.

874~~~
He simple does not have the physical tools necessary to play cb at the this level. Too slow to handle Mane on the ground and not strong enough to handle Pelle in the air. I'd like to see us play Jones-Smalling with Blind at lb once Jones is healthy.

875~~~
I said earlier he wasn't getting any protection and we saw him exposed. Between Rojo and Carrick he was getting next to no protection. He's a very capable centreback when the system is there.

876~~~
He's not the permanent solution in defense but he can get the job done at many times.

We may need one more signing to this formation but this time it has to be a highest shelf defender, possibly with bit of experience, too.

877~~~
He struggled today, I thought it was his poorest game of the season. Couldn't cope with Pelle physically and couldn't handle Mane's pace. I think we saw how vital Shaw is for us in the way him and Smalling act as bodyguards either side of him, Rojo positionally doesn't have the discipline to do the same job.

878~~~
not good today

879~~~
Opposition team will target him obviously. He's the weak point. In most games it will go well but there are games where it just won't work, especially if it's a team that manages to trouble us

880~~~
Can we put him on some 'roids or something? No one will notice...

881~~~
Struggled a lot more today like people are saying. He's a calming presence to have at the back when we're playing well and look more comfortable, but he's definitely going to struggle against dangerous strikers, like Pelle today.

882~~~
Run ragged today.

883~~~
I can totally understand LvG's thinking in keeping Blind at CB and Rojo LB for this game given that Blind has been playing well there and it's particularly important to have stability at the back. After today it shouldn't happen anymore. Rojo is too clumsy and technically lacking to attack effectively and Blind's physical limitations as a CB are obvious. If he doesn't switch them I'll be disappointed.

884~~~
One bad game shouldn't dappen his hopes at all.

885~~~
Very poor today, struggled at lb and cb but that is going to happen, he is in the team more for his passing rather than his defensive ability so he is going to be a liability when he is exposed or pressurised.

Clearly he can do a job there in certain games but week in week out he just defend well enough and in some games he just shouldn't play, today mane was going past him like he wasn't even there and pelle was just bullying him.

886~~~
It worked well, and like someone said, Shaw and Smalling could cover for him and protect him. Unfortunately, with Rojo there just isnt that sort of class at LB that he used to have with Shaw. I was sceptical from the beginning and predicted a nightmare, but was surprised how well we managed to hide his weaknesses. He was very good in most games. Today though, i think he got totally destroyed from Pelle and Mane. Every decent chance they created, Blind either lost out to Pelle, or got driblled/beaten to pace by Mane. Long term, i dont think he is an option. Under LvG, it probably will work in most games.

887~~~
Why does one game ruin his chances?  He did fine against gomis,  benteke etc and he had a torrid time against pele and we should give up? 

This is his 1st season at CB &  not even that.  To say he couldn't improve after experience is stupid.

888~~~
Im sure its his positioning and awareness that has kept us in good stead thus far.

889~~~
He didn't have much to do in those games which made him look good. Liverpool included, as they packed 10 men behind the ball. In the 2 games, where he was up against some pressure he was very, very poor(today) and shaky and poor(Swansea).

Romero was pretty "solid" in his first 4 games and in just one game each we saw the difference in having DDG and Romero in goal.

890~~~
Blind was never just solid; pleanty of times fans & commentators called him out for MOTMs. 

I think its not just blind who needs to change but the whole team needs altering when occasionally playing teama like Southampton & Swansea.

891~~~
I think he was ok against Spurs, poor at Swansea and PSV, very poor today, MOTM against Pool, very good against Villa and good in the other two games.

IMO he'll do well as a CB for Barcelona for example, but at United he'll struggle.

892~~~
He was poor against Gomis as well.

893~~~
One of his off game. Will come back stronger I am sure. Needs a Bastian in front of him and a good LB.

894~~~
That's the thing with Blind, we essentially have to cover him with a bodyguard either side as if he is forced to defend one on one against some of the PL's powerhouse forwards he is going to struggle, it's a huge sacrifice for the LB to make and he has to be on his game all of the time, we made it work with Shaw as Shaw is superb, but with Rojo? I don't think so. Maybe we can make it work a bit better with Young there as if LvG tasks him with a job he will stick to it and is more disciplined than Rojo plus he can communicate better. Of course he's not gonna be much help physically to Blind like Shaw was.

895~~~
He did well against Benteke, but he was poor vs Gomis and now vs Pelle. It is quite visibly obvious that he will struggle with height. As a EPL CB, that is a big problem.

896~~~
People will go all over Blind because of his size blah blah, but he got done because Rojo was poor, the Rojo got his ass together, everything was fine.

897~~~
I might just be lookong for excuses but theres a chance we might have been playing smalling as a sweeper and blind in front. 

The amount of times iv seen blind be the first towards the ball with smalling in cover makes me think this is something that is planned rather than blinds poor positioning. 

On top pf that Mcnair came in the last game; replaced blind who is clearly not just a CB but also has the ability to play at DM much like blind does. 

If that is the case then our fullbacks performances are directly related towards blind's performance. 

A bit of a far fetched tactical point but considering this sweeper system was used by ajax and van gaal before; it could have been implemented already. 

In all games blind has been poor our performances of our LB & RB have been poor through injury or performance.

898~~~
He was really poor yesterday, Pelle gave him all sorts of hassle. He's been good up against the non physical teams playing at centre half. I do think long term we need to buy a proper defender. It will be interesting when Jones is match fit whether he'll come back in and Blind will be out.

899~~~
He was very good vs all other teams. Even against Gomis besides that one event where they hit the post, he didn't really get exposed by Gomis like smalling and darmian did. 

Sunday's game again none of our defenders played well. Darmian in particular was poor. Makes me think that this was a one off than a regular thing.

As for he doesn't have awareness he has more awareness than Jones or rojo or anyone else in our team.

900~~~
It'll always be like this, Blind will constantly be under the microscope, he's not allowed to have a below average game,  if he does its immediately because he isn't strong enough to be a centre back. Never mind the fact the rest of the defense were also shit, or that Pelle 'bullied' Smalling as much as he did Blind on the weekend, that'll be entirely irrelevant, they've already make up their mind he can't play at centreback and nothing will change that.

901~~~
Another assist from Blind, beautiful high throughball for Rooney to finish.

He really does add an extra dimension to our attacks.

902~~~
Its so saddening to see people actually want one of our players to do bad, just to say told you so.

903~~~
His passing has been the highlight of the half, at least from what I can make out on the crappy stream.

904~~~
It's just so slick, he forces us to play a little more aggressively as well. He seems to have complete confidence in his own ability and that of our central midfielders to play a ball into the feet of our CMs when they've got opposition near by, knowing they'll be able to play out, he really does start moves off for us there.

905~~~
I really hope he becomes consistent defensively (not that he's done bad all in all), his passing range is ridiculous for a cb and extremely useful. 3 assists already this season.

906~~~
Superb work tonight.  Not as visible in the 2nd half but showed excellent range with his passing.

907~~~
Great ball for Rooney, getting us that critical first breakthrough. Really helps to have a centre half like Blind when we're attacking most of the game and the opposition is content to defend. A more physical and 'pure' defender would be nowhere near as useful in these kinds of matches.

908~~~
I doubted him as a CB at the start of the season but I must say I am loving our defence with him in there. If we only had Shaw (<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>) we would have the best back five in the league.

909~~~
I love the way his distribution works in conjunction with Schweini who knows he can stay a bit higher up the pitch and Blind will find him with those threaded passes through the first line of the opposition. I sometimes feel our other CM's don't do this and come too close to him.

910~~~
Exactly, they've just got to trust that Blind will be find those passes when they're a little further up the pitch, he has the ability.

911~~~
It definitely feels he has more assists to his name than just 3....

912~~~
Wow what a pass

913~~~
Daley Beckham

914~~~
What a pass!

915~~~
Magnificent again, he has at least one killer pass a game.

916~~~
Doing really well in defence but those balls in have created so many goals this season.

917~~~
Been the best player on the pitch.

918~~~
It's basically cheating to have a centreback who can play passes like that.

919~~~
Quickly becoming one of my favourite players in this team.

920~~~
What a pass, so flat that it cut the defense out completely.

921~~~
Squad player at best.

922~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

923~~~
Quality pass that. There will come times where he will be dominated physically or out paced, but when it comes to breaking down defences his ability on the ball is priceless.

924~~~
It's not surprising any more. He's more than capable of playing such quality balls every game. Too good a passer to be a CB.

925~~~
Amazing passing range. We always knew that but he's a CB now.

926~~~
Put him down as my motm.

927~~~
In these types of games he's exactly what you want at the back when you know you'll have the ball.

928~~~
Games like these are where we see the benefit of him at the back, in truth he was our best CM today.

929~~~
When Blind went down injured I had my heart in my mouth. Very pleased to see him walk it off. He has matured into the Rijkaard role in a way I never ever expected. The way Blind plays the ball out from the back is crucial to so much of what we do going forward. Long may it continue.

930~~~
I don't know how you can draw that conclusion from today's performance, was solid today, played well.

931~~~
Love Blind - been probably the best player for us this season.

932~~~
Not at all. Having someone play those balls from the CB position where he will get every time on the ball he likes looks brilliant to me.

933~~~
Being sarcastic, that's what got spread about him so often while he is a key player for us. He can be a key player for us at every position except ST, RW, and GK, the guy would even do a job for you on left wing.

934~~~
ah ok <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

hard to tell sarcasm online.

935~~~
The epitome of a ball playing CB. Fantastic today.

936~~~
That ball <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

937~~~
I think its because he is playing at CB he has the space to play the balls that he does since there really is no-one marking him.

938~~~
Him at cb adds a whole new dimension to our game. Excellent player.

939~~~
That pass was so good! Scholes-esque!

940~~~
A thing of beauty <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

His passing and composure makes up for his physical limitations I reckon

941~~~
I love Blind. He's asked to do a job here and he does it with little to no fuss. For the reported fee, he's been a fantastic acquisition.

Ifs and buts tend to take you on a road to nowhere, but with more pace and power I think he'd be a phenomenal footballer in multiple positions. In spite of a small build, he manages his game very intelligently.

942~~~
Quality player and a fantastic signing.  

He is really coming into his own right now; that 2 games on the trot he has played defence splitting passes that have led to a goal. Add to that his fantastic positional sense and a genuine understanding emerging with Smalling and De Gea.  

He is the surprise player of the season so far.

943~~~
Its between him, Shaw and Smalling.

944~~~
Lvg has just got it absolutely spot on putting him at centre back. He is absolutely crucial to our play now and he has silenced a lot of people

945~~~
People keep acting as if he's the shortest CB in the world and it's a miracle (and a matter of time) that no forward has taken advantage of that yet. At 1.80 (5'11) he's comfortably taller than Cannavaro, Baresi, Moore, Puyol and as tall as Beckenbauer and Koeman. He might be a bit smaller than the average for a CB but it's definitely not as much as people make it out to be. He can still be a fantastic CB.

946~~~
That's why we have a right/left foot combo at the back

947~~~
I'll raise my hand up..I was wrong about him..he has been very good, especially his passing range which helps us a lot with the football we play...

948~~~
Could someone please upload a gif of that pass.. I just can't stop thinking about it. What a beauty that was!! O.o

949~~~
This. It's working great for us because if the opposition try to close him down more its just going to open up more space for the likes of Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Mata. I'm really digging his role in the team.

950~~~
That's a fair point. He is above average height but I guess small for the position.
Do Fifa ban massive heels in boots to add an inch or two?  Maybe he could walk on tip-toes like <a class="username" data-user="47354, @ItsEssexRob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47354/">@ItsEssexRob</a>

951~~~
Fantastic pass from the back, again! It just highlights what an asset it can be to have him at CB. How many other CB's can play those kind of passes consistently?

952~~~
Had a fantastic game, that pass for the first goal was sublime.

953~~~
We just have to keep ensuring we protect him and the back line (avoiding games like the Swansea one). I don't want to find out if he can defend. His balls from the back give us something different and we probably didn't have that kinda quality with Rio and Vidic in the back line. He's playing some good searching balls forward at the minute.

954~~~
Probably not a bad job since he can cross the ball like no one can in our squad.

Great player who silenced a lot of critics.

955~~~
And we should play about 18-20 a year of these at home including CL and cups. That's a third of the season.

956~~~
with our high possession football it's definitely not a gamble with him as a CB, and he contributes to our attack with sublime passes like today. I'm convinced we're not as desperate for a new CB like we were last season.

957~~~
Blind's is turning into the complete ball playing centre back a la Maldini or Rio. 

His first touch is fantastic and he has the vision and ability to complete fantastic counterattacking passes.  His positioning and anticipation whilst defending also makes up for his slight lack of physicality.  And he is proud and loves playing for Manchester United. 

Blind possesses all the ingredients for a distinguished career in the heart of our defence and has become my favourite player in the squad along with Martial.

958~~~
It's brilliant when it works. We're finally starting to see the pieces of the philosophy fall into place, and provide results more frequently. Blind is really confident on the ball, passes with precision, and has turned out be a great asset as a defender as well. I really like him at center back, he's made his manager look pretty smart.

959~~~
They better adjust his passing statistics in Football Manager 2016!

960~~~
I remember seeing our first pre-season games when Blind was pushed into CB and he had a shocker (think it was next to Jones). He managed to play better throughout the tour but it still made no sense why we were doing that.

If you didnt know where he played and he was bought this season, Id look at it and think Blind was a CB and an almost perfect partner to lead with Smalling. His height might be an issue at times but his positional play at CB is great. 

With the way United play, it means hes never exposed and you can tell he leads the back well. Plus when hes on the ball he can make himself into an additional midfielder in tight games like today.

961~~~
Definitely Van Gaal's best signing IMO.

Hard to believe at the time he would be so influential.

962~~~
If you're going to defend by keeping the ball I can't think of many I'd rather have at the back. He's not the natural defender Pique is but he's doing the same job for us.

963~~~
I hold my hands up, I was the one who thought playing him at CB was just one of those weird pre-season experiments and badly wanted LVG to stop it after the friendlies. He's performing way better than I could've ever expected. Love the guy!

964~~~
He's been great so far but I don't think he's our long term solution at CB. We tend to keep Smalling (and one of the fullbacks when defending) close to him most of the time due to his obvious lack of pace. In my opinion,  he's the perfect backup defensive midfielder to Schneiderlin. In fact, on current form he should play there instead of him. I would be interested to see a Blind-BFS or Blind-Carrick combo at the heart of our midfield.

965~~~
His passes in the final third have been absolutely class!! Been the player of the season along with Smalling for me so far. He is going to keep getting better. I have to keep reminding myself that he is only 25!! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

966~~~
Superb ball to Mata for our second goal. Always has that eyes for a good pass.

967~~~
First, He's do dreamy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Second, with the way that the majority of teams set up against us it'll always be the cbs that are the spare man so there's an emphasis on them to move forward and open the play. We've seen mighty Mike making a lot of runs from deep this year attacking the space <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> whilst Daley often find loads of time on the ball now and he's got such beautiful eyes.... for a pass I mean, that he'll make chances  for us. It's got potential to be a great partnership this season 
Third, seriously how sexy is this man, might get the wife a shirt with his name on

968~~~
I'm more impressed with him every game. One of our most improved players since LVG took over for sure. Great to see.

969~~~
He's becoming a serious dilemma for teams,  sit back against us and you're just offering up time and territory for Blind to exploit with his superb passing. Choose to press him and you'll leave space for the midfield to work in further forward. He's an absolutely essential play for us now and is as important in an attacking sense for us than any other player.

970~~~
Do you think he's worked it out yet? Or should we give him a couple more months to get on the same page as you?

971~~~
LvG deserves serious credit for this. Majority of the people weren't convinced by him when it started but I think his performances this season have proved a lot of people wrong.

What's funny is that he's not allowed to have a below average game on here. One mistake and the moan brigade will be out in full force.

972~~~
You say that though, but he clearly is a natural defender. He reads the game like the best and intercepts extremely well, if he wasn't there is no chance he would do so well at CB. obviously his limitations are his pace but because he reads the game so well he makes up for that difference, and he is actually stronger than we all thought, he rarely gets muscled off the ball. 

In pre season I really did dread the idea of him being our main CB, but now I couldn't imagine us without him at the back, he just gives us a completely different option, almost like a quarterback. 

Smalling also does a great job of covering him, in the 1 striker systems they both work extremely well together.

973~~~
The truth is he could play any position on the pitch to a high standard purely on the fact that he has perfect reading of the game. He's going to be a great manager.

974~~~
Every game there is at least a goal that starts with him or where he plays an important part. He is very important to the buildup. I had my doubts like everyone else, but it looks like this LVG chap knows what he's doing after all.

This also shows why we weren't interested in the likes of Otamendi this summer, we needed a ball playing CB. If we could have got Ramos, Hummels or some other CB with excellent passing they would have been invaluable to us, like having Blind on steroids.

975~~~
Nice comparison mate haha!

976~~~
Absolutely, he has to win every header, every physical challenge, no striker is allowed to get in behind him or we will hear he hasn't got the pace or strength to play there. It happens to every defender, if they perfect then nobody would score any goals.

977~~~
I think it's a little telling that if you look at the caf's average he is clearly below Darmian, Smalling and Shaw despite scoring a great goal, three assists and helping keep 6 clean sheets. He is judged more harshly than those others because certain people were convinced he couldn't do a job and every thing he does at CB is under the microscope.

978~~~
I think he's been largely excellent at CB. So far he's proved me and countless others wrong.

979~~~
He's been excellent at centre back, which is kudos to Van Gaal, as most people thought he'd be a nightmare there. 

He's excellent on the ball, which is probably the main reason why he's being played there, but as well as that, he reads the game superbly well. Doing really well. That ball he played to Mata for the first goal was fantastic.

980~~~
He plays a similar role to what Rijkaard played for ajax in 1994/95 imo

981~~~
Such an asset to have someone with his passing playing at CB. LVG masterstroke.

982~~~
Its the internet..many people do not want to be wrong..and will stick to an opinion no matter what..I thought playing him there was a ridiculous  decision  , considering his pace and strength, but I think I failed to consider his other strengths in making that judgement. His ball playing abilities fit our defense to the t and he fits the formation well. I was wrong.

However, what I think will happen now is the same thing that happened with Valencia last season at RB. He may play well for the majority of the season, but one mistake and they will be people coming out of the woodwork with I told you so. There is a desperation to be right on here, even if it means the team doing badly.

983~~~
Yeah but I'd sooner draw the comparison with Frank de Boer. In many ways a very similar player to Daley. Same height, fairly slow, but great vision and passing.

984~~~
I think you're being extremely generous there.

985~~~
His best form for us was in his first few months here. I think he won one or two player of the months back then and until february or march people were calling him our player of the season so I have no idea how did you come up with that.

986~~~
The management team and Daley himself deserve immense credit for this so far.

987~~~
He's proving a lot of us wrong so far. Apart from that first half against Pelle, he's looked very good. Long may it continue.

988~~~
His great games at the start of last season were always against teams that had 10 behind the ball, put no pressure on us and let us have all the possession. But he always struggled in high intensity physical games.

This season he had no problems marking the likes of Benteke and Gestede, I don't understand how you can't see the improvement?

989~~~
If he wasn't a good natural defender how would be look so solid all the time? Arguably Phil Jones isn't a natural defender in my eyes, everything he does is rushed or panicked.

990~~~
He is playing completely different position this year, and it's not like he is outmuscling big players now. I really like Blind, but it's really stupid to say that he made an improvement when he played different position last year and he was actually more than decent last year too, especially at the start.

991~~~
I would still be nervous playing him vs better teams and better (and bigger) strikers, but he's done very well so far.

992~~~
CB seems to be his best position.


Master stroke by LVG.

993~~~
No bigger strikers in PL then Gestede and Benteke and he has handled both of them quite comfortably.

994~~~
Ouch! You're cruel.

995~~~
Yet he struggled vs the size of Gomis and against the pace of Mane.

996~~~
It was our midfield that failed to deal with Mane appropriately. He was getting far too much space in the final third when Blind was occupied with Pelle. It seems to be that if a player scores a goal against a defence with Blind in it, it must be Blind's fault and therefore exposes him as not good enough at CB. Even top class centre halves get beaten, and sometimes by not very good players.

997~~~
Been immense for us, together with Smalling. Great partnership.

998~~~
You can see how intelligent he is just by watching him play. Always takes the space if the other team drop off and is a fantastic passer those comparing him to De Boer, I agree with.

I would be willing to bet he will someday lead Holland in a World Cup as manager.

999~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
Check out the replay of the first goal, he clearly loses Mane and is an a bad position when the cross comes in.

1000~~~
Re-watching the game our first two goals were initiated from precise long passes by him bypassing the midfield and right into the forwards' stride. It was beautiful, almost Scholes-like.

1001~~~
I thought you meant the game as a whole and not one particular instance. In which yes, he lost his marker but the reason we conceded in the end was that no one tracked Pelle's follow up run. Really don't see how losing your marker once counts as 'struggling' against that player but whatever. I guess Vidic was also a bad defender who struggled against pace and trickery.

1002~~~
Fine then. For their next chance (Smalling's bad clearance) he was turned very easily, forcing DDG to make a good save.
I surely don't need to prove that our left side was completely exposed in that match till we scored(~35mins), with Blind and Rojo both looking lost. After that Mane changed position (Neville made a big deal of this in commentary) and their threat reduced.
If you think we were defending fine at that time, I don't think there's much we can debate about, because we must have been seeing very different games.


EDIT: Also, conveniently ignoring Blind's full game struggle vs Gomis?
About Vidic, I do think he wasn't perfectly comfortable vs a top-class fast striker (Torres, Eto'o, Lyon's Benzema). But that is the absolute elite of world strikers, no shame in that.

1003~~~
To be honest we were being overrun across the pitch at that time so I wouldn't really single out Blind. The midfield was losing the ball left and right and Southampton were getting space to strut their stuff all over the park. It was a nightmare. I also think Rojo and Blind didn't work very well together, probably owing to the fact that's the first time (I think) they've played in those positions at the same time. 

I do remember Neville's commentary about it but I recall it as being more about Pelle than Mane. I shall have to go back and check. Either way, my point is more that having a single bad performance or difficulties against one particular attacker doesn't necessarily mean Blind has serious deficiencies and can't be a good CB for us. I'd be very surprised if he didn't have some poor games there from time to time, but I think so far he's shown himself to be worthy of the starting slot.

1004~~~
Mane picks up the ball beyond our 2 defensive midfielders so Blind steps out, when you have 2 DMs on the pitch that should never happen. Once he is running from deep like that Blind has no chance, nor would 99% of centre backs against the pace of Mane.

1005~~~
The Mane goal was a great goal. Sometimes you just have to hold up your hands and credit the quality of the run and cross. It happens.

The over-analysis of specific goals is one of the more grating aspects of modern football. Football teams concede goals and defenders get dragged out of position. Given we've only conceded five league goals I think it's fair to say that Blind, on the whole, has performed very impressively.

There's definitlely truth in the argument that some people are just waiting for Blind to get outmuscled and scream "I told you so!"

He's proven me wrong so far and many others. All power to him.

1006~~~
To be fair, Blind did have a poor game against Southampton, struggling against Mane's pace and Pelle's physicality as well at times. He's been very good in defence for us so far, and has partnered with Smalling excellently, but not everyone who doubts his ability there is just doing it for the, "I told you so" aspect: some people are simply dubious as to whether he's going to be a good centre-back long-term, which is fair enough considering we've still not seen too much of him there, and he did have a weak game against Southampton.

Performing very well overall though, and was brilliant against Liverpool.

1007~~~
Everyone in our back like struggled that game. Both the goals, smalling and darmian were beaten too easily. Gomis scored being marked by both darmian and smalling. Blind had nothing to do with the goals.

1008~~~
Not much I disagree with there. Long term it's fair to say that I'm also dubious, obviously dependant on our wider aspirations. Will we win a CL title with Blind at central defence? It would take a bold man to argue yes. But right now he's certainly justyfiying his place in the side.

1009~~~
I think this is one of the reasons why Van Gaal is adamant about being organized and controlling possession as much as possible during a game so that we don't put him into situations where he has to physically match opposition attackers and get into 1 on 1 situations. He's going to lose more of those than win them, in the Southampton game the entire defense had a bad day. Carrick couldn't handle Mane, Darmian couldn't deal with Tadic and so on. Once we got over those issues and settled into our routine rhythm we went back to dominating the game.

Teams can only hurt us on the counter, they cannot construct a passing game and cope with our pressing. We will face tougher opposition from teams like Everton, Palace and Leicester this season than someone like Arsenal, Chelsea or Liverpool.

1010~~~
That's definitely what LVG is trying to do, but no matter how much we work on it, there are always going to be games where we're on the back-foot, or struggle when up against a really dangerous opposition player, whether that be due to his pace/skill/strength or whatever.

I'm a fan of us trying to go with defenders who have plenty of ability on the ball and can play it out from the back. At the same time though, I'm going to be very doubtful of someone who's not particularly brilliant when it comes to matching up to an opposition player, even if it's not necessarily on a physical level.

1011~~~
Oh how LvG was ridiculed for playing him as a CB... the hysteria at the start of the season...

1012~~~
There was never really "hysteria" though, just a lot of doubt that someone who's not particularly physical and isn't often used as a centre-back would be capable of performing well there for us. Which is fair enough. Obviously he has so far, which is fantastic.

1013~~~
Oh but there was hysteria and it came at a time when redcafe's disgruntlement with LvG's tenure here was at a breaking point and every other post on here basically contained a snide dig or another about LvG as if he were some incapable nitwit who won a competition to manage one of the biggest clubs in the world.
Even as early as in pre season there were not only 'fair' doubts and healthy criticism, there were plenty who were using Blind at CB as another stick to beat LvG with as to cement his image on here as some village idiot.

1014~~~
To be fair, he 'sometimes' IS one... And that's why I love the man ^^

1015~~~
Because he's playing in a team that defends by keeping the ball and has very little defending to do. When he becomes isolated he struggles.

I have no comments on Phil Jones.

1016~~~
There have been pleanty of times where blinds been isolated and he has been fine most notably agaisnt benteke.  

Every single defender will occasionally struggle when isolated; so whats your point?

1017~~~
Well, you mean apart from in the first half an hour where Benteke actually went up against him and destroyed him, then somehow inexplicably decided to go up against Smalling instead and got marked out of the game? He also struggled against Spuds, Swansea (very evidently) and PSV. He's also been suspect in wide areas.

Whether you agree or not, it shouldn't have been too difficult to work out. Your snarky tone is even more amusing by your admission.

1018~~~
Destroyed. Jesus Christ.

1019~~~
He lost every battle and we didn't concede through luck, nothing else. Blind is great at limiting the times this happens, but to deny the severity when it does happen is nonsense.

1020~~~
What's my snarky tone exactly?  You trying to figure out how i speak through what i type?  Anyway; bulding physique is pretty simple and has yet to cost us severely apart from swansea &  psv when our whole defensive left hand side got shattered; never mind the right hand side that didn't do any better. 

I ask you; if he has had predominantly more than an average season then why cannot he improve?  Or is it only wonderkids who get that opportunity.  After a year's time and experience i dont see why blind couldn't work out any of his shortcomings that you mention. 

I'v been one for the pro-blind books from the start when most of our performances was herald as wonderful in defence and utter shite in attack.  Now you come along wanting to take away the only attacking aspect of our game that the  opposition cannot deal with; arguably our 3rd dimension for even more defensive ability?  Is that right?

1021~~~
Further to say i dont think i have seen performances like daley blind's role in the team sinse ronald koeman's for barcelona. 

Arguably smalling is a sweeper; with his physique and the nature of the premier-league; playing two defenders like blind or even half of blinds atracking ability would be suicide.  Blind paroles the defence; smalling is usually the man to cover.

1022~~~
And it's nonsense to pretend other defenders don't regularly get beaten to the ball either. He really didn't lose every battle by the way, that's a ridiculous statement and would be more accurate the other way around,  I think you need to watch the game again, Daley Blind was widely considered MOTM mate.

1023~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What? How is it luck when there were numerous Blind vs. Benteke situations and Blind came out of all of them on top? You can argue that part of the reason Blind won was that Benteke didn't do very well, but not that it was just 'luck'.

When you're so far out of step with the overwhelming consensus, there's normally a reason. Blind was good in that game.

1024~~~
They faced each other in the air once or twice in the entire game and Blind had several interceptions and was pretty comfortable all game.

1025~~~
Don't even try to deny your last comment wasn't snarky. And if you look my only comment was that Blind "wasn't a natural defender". I never said he couldn't improve, no idea why you're going off on a tangent.

1026~~~
I didn't say they didn't? There aren't many natural defenders around. 

Well he didn't, and Benteke did badly vs Smalling, he was getting plenty of joy vs Blind.

I never said anything about the rest of the game when Blind did exceptionally well. But in those first 30 minutes he was being constantly abused.
He was comfortable after Benteke moved over to Smalling (Although not even Neville could work out why).[/QUOTE]

1027~~~
Benteke never played on Blind, he spent almost the entire game between both and Smalling dealt with him and failed in the air.

1028~~~
When? They faced off in the air three times and Blind came out on top in all three.

1029~~~
It's fairly obvious why I've made that comment don't you think?

You really need to watch the game again, you're so wide of the mark it's a little odd, Blind essentially had him in his pocket during those early exchanges before Benteke was starved of the ball completely, one noticeable instance where Blind eased Beneke off a high ball on the edge of our box and casually turned away from him.

Its when people make ridiculous criticisms like this that it takes away any genuine critique of a player.

1030~~~
That's just totally wrong. He started playing on Blind and then moved across around half an hour in which coincide with our entrance into the game.

They were playing the ball into Benteke's feet early on, not his head. That's why they were actually involved in the game and not a tactical shambles they developed into later on.

1031~~~
I think you do, the goal and his performance later in the match seems to have clouded your judgement of the first half an hour or so. Liverpool were well in the game and lots of the joy they had was playing balls into Benteke with their pace on the overlap down the right side. Carragher was going mental about Benteke switching during halftime, it was impossible to miss. I gave Blind MotM for that game as well, but that's because he got a goal and was virtually flawless for 60 minutes after that, not because I have selective blindness to ignore when he was struggling.

1032~~~
Liverpool weren't involved in the game at all in the first half and them playing the ball to Benteke's feet create nothing.  You're the only person I've seen act like Liverpool did anything at all in the first half.  In fact we did barely anything in the first half either.  It was the most uneventful 45 minutes of football I've ever watched in my life.

1033~~~
You can't polish a turd. Liverpool aren't a good team at the moment and Rogers butchered them tactically. That doesn't mean the ball into Benteke along the floor wasn't causing us problems, Liverpool just didn't do it enough and failed to capitalise on it when they did.

1034~~~
His first run is  completely on the left, the offside chance from Can's pass is on the left, he is at the end of a cross on the right but he is marked by Shaw, on the right he had no success at all and even got bullied by Blind and Shaw a couple of time. He spent most of the time on the left. You are totally reinventing the game.

Edit: At the 25mn just after being brushed away by Blind, the commentator says that it's surprising that Benteke doesn't play more on Blind's side.

1035~~~
Casually skipping over the 3 other occasions where they play the ball into Benteke while he's running into the right channel but ok <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> If you think Blind is a natural defender then that is your business, but I'm done with people trying to argue that things I'm watching right now on a .mkv file is tiresome.

1036~~~
You laugh but I'm watching the game and he did nothing at all, in the first half at least. Will see the second tomorrow.

1037~~~
<i>Everyone</i> is now disagreeing with you. I'd say it's time to give us the actual time of these incidents during the game where Benteke is 'destroying' Blind, or give up.

1038~~~
3 people, you should check what selection bias is. Like I said, if you think Blind is a natural defender that's your call, but I'm done arguing the existence of factual events.

1039~~~
Only twice so far have his physical shortcomings been an issue this season, against Gomis and Pelle, for some reason Pelle moved to Smalling during that game though.

He's clearly worked on his upper body strength though and is doing very well, long term I don't see him as our starting CB but I am not worried about him this season as long as we keep Darmian as the LB to help cover him.

1040~~~
<a class="username" data-user="50019, @Dion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50019/">@Dion</a> you are confusing the Southampton game with the Liverpool one. Pelle was the one who stayed with blind for first 30 minutes and then went over to smalling s side. Benteke did nothing all game for Liverpool vs us except that goal.

1041~~~
I've been patient and excited with the Blind at CB experiment and I'm glad it's working out so well. An absolute joy to watch. It's sometimes unfair to have a player who can pass a ball so sweetly from defence. His pass to Mata was similar to his WC pass for RVP vs Spain. Hits is so aesthetically. 

Love our Dutch Lion.

1042~~~
Love the op of this thread.
Van Gaal has this one right, he's as good at cb as elsewhere imo
(which is pretty damn good)

1043~~~
?

What was unreasonable about thinking he would struggle to nail down a starting place at that time?

I'm not embarrassed to say I didn't see this move to CB coming.

1044~~~
I actually really like him playing at CB. Providing the team does their jobs correctly in other areas then his physical weaknesses are unlikely to be exposed on a regular basis. He offers so much going forward that I think it's worth the risk of him playing there. 

Plus he's pretty dreamy.

1045~~~
I've never ever wanted to be so amish.

1046~~~
Its funny in hindsight
He's been a surprise

1047~~~
He's done well. However with our lack of left back cover with Rojo and Shaw out, and with Jones fit again perhaps get the Smalling and Jones partnership back and Blind LB.

1048~~~
Based on what we've seen of Otamendi so far, will you guys still prefer Otamendi over Blind?

1049~~~
Bit early too say. Blind has started well, in a side he already played for. Otamendi has moved to a new country, where he can't speak the language (i don't think he can) and to a new side.

I hope Blind has the better season but it's too soon.

1050~~~
Mangala was trash last year and has done pretty well for City this season. Some players just take longer to adapt to a new league and a new country. There's no denying Otamendi's qualities though.

With that being said, Blind was a solid player last year and has performed very well this season. Him and Smalling make on forget about the CB issues that were being discussed earlier in the year.

1051~~~
Until the last couple of months in the last season, the beginners guide to beating United was to press the CBs and midfield and United would more often than not crumble under the pressure, due to poor technical abilities of the players. Even mediocre teams were able to seize initiative and control of the midfield. Due to a combination of buying better players and coaching the existing ones we became assured in our passing and duly punished Tottenham, Liverpool and City in that run.  However from the Chelsea game onwards, opposition went for a course correction and started staying deep and letting us play in front of their defence and midfield. Since then we have also generally struggled to score many goals (except very recently). 

With Blind, and his passing ability, we have a perfect tool to counter the opposition's tactics (other than having better attacking players of course!). He has got the ability to pick out passes from the deep and he has contributed to several important goals this season already. Our setup has left the opposition in a quandary - should they press high up to our CBs or stay back and we have a solution for either of the two strategies.

1052~~~
The most important thing blind does at centre back is takes all responsibility off Smalling to "build up the play".  Thus allowing Smalling to concentrate on defending and defending only.  As Blind gets more time on the ball at the back than in a holding position it also helps him get his head up better.  In midfield everything was always side ways.  At centre half he quite often fizzes a pass into the front or even goes long.  Its good for smalling, good for blind and at the moment good for the team.

Sure he might struggle when we go away to certain clubs that will bombard us wit the high ball.  Rio and Vidic could never handle Fellaini at Goodison.  At the highest level blinds strength in the air isn't going to be an issue as we wont face that kind of style.  Equally, lightening fast players when standing up a centre half will glide past most.  We also defend fairly deep and so his reading of the game (which is excellent) really helps him in at centre back.  He's no slower or no more vulnerable in the air than Hummels.

1053~~~
The same thing happened with Benteke which is why it was so bizarre when Pelle did it the next weekend even though Pelle was beating him in the air rather than into feet mostly.

1054~~~
Blind's ball control has been superb this season but his is beginning to separate himself in the quality of his passing.  He's been sublime recently.  Loving it and hoping he can stay paired with Smalling although a more physical Jones may eventually be needed against the bigger guys.

1055~~~
No chance. Blind won't be and shouldnt be moved. We have Darmian and Young as options at LB.

1056~~~
Probably you're right. I'd just like Jones having another shot in the starting lineup. Still believe he could break in for us and be Smalling's partner for years to come, for United and England.

1057~~~
I'd much, much rather have Blind's assured, intelligent play and superb passing from deep than Jones' calamity and reckless "9 poor first touches in a row has somehow found me in the oppositions half" style of carrying the ball out from deep.

1058~~~
I think it's because they are both right footed they want to start from the left and run behind the right CB, being able to shoot on their right foot. If they start making runs from the right they are either running straight or cutting in on their left foot.

1059~~~
Danny boy is a class act.  He's proved everyone wrong.  Long may his form continue.

1060~~~
This is the first thing I thought about when we I saw him in CB position. They complement each other so well- Smalling is a psychical beast but also has excellent positioning and anticipation (unlike Jones for example), but when on the ball, he struggles under pressure. Having someone like Blind, who will always find a way to get out of trouble is doing wonders.

I wouldn’t trust Blind with any other CB but when Smalling is around, I am not worried at all.

1061~~~
I watched the Liverpool game and don't remember even once benteke doing anything to create problems for Blind. Blind even brushed him off the ball at least 2 times with ease and this actually made Gary Neville wonder if benteke isn't 100% fit.

1062~~~
he's injured all the time

1063~~~
Quite possibly, seems silly when they were getting joy down that side originally though.

1064~~~
haha yeah how many goals has he scored since Arsenal?  He's made of glass.
Reminds me of that Samuel L Jackson character from Unbreakable.

1065~~~
He's been brilliant so far this season, really making that CB spot his own. As someone else said, it's practically cheating having a player who can pass as well as he does from the center of the defense. 

Still think he was LVG's best signing last summer.

1066~~~
Like I said, good player but not a natural defender.

1067~~~
He's a good centre back.

1068~~~
Not a natural defender, too slow for left back and physically not strong enough for centre of midfield.

1069~~~
Not sure if he was worse at cb or in midfield tonight, no idea why he wasn't subbed. I see the logic of playing him against sides who park the bus or who we dominate possession against but in any game where the other side attacks with any quality and speed he is a big liability and smalling is almost defending for both of them at times. 

By all means keep playing him at home against certain teams but he has to be left out of some games, starting with arsenal on Sunday.

1070~~~
For a team that defends by keeping the ball. He showed again today why he isn't a natural defender.

1071~~~
Below par today at CB and when moved into MF.

He's at the very least a decent CB, yes. He's done much better than I thought he would and has filled in admirably there. With Jones back and Shaw out it makes more sense to me to move him to LB. We wouldn't lose much, if any of Blind's ability to find clever forward passes and he's clearly a better option than Valencia (who he'd be replacing, effectively, with Darmian going to RB, which would also make sense). I get that him playing in the centre mitigates for Smalling's relative lack of ability on the ball but a) that's a price worth paying and b) Smalling is improving on the ball all the time.

1072~~~
Tough game for him today as Wolfsburg pressed us and he didn't have the space to bring the ball into midfield and get his passing going.

1073~~~
Was a liability today, was worried everytime a player would run at him, only positive is he can play great balls from deep. He's painfully slow and weak to play centre back. Jones looked good when he came on let's hope he can kick on like Smalling, we need it if we are going to win anything.

1074~~~
It doesn't matter whether he's natural or artificial or whatever else, if he's a good centre back then he's a good centre back. Juan Mata was poor against PSV but excellent tonight, that's why you look at all the games the player has played. So far he has shown himself to be a good centre back.

1075~~~
It makes sense to move him to LB because Jones is a good centre back and Darmian is better than Valencia. So that back four is superior, but Blind has still shown himself to be a good centre back this season.

Louis van Gaal will probably know what the right thing to do is anyway. He might decide we benefit from a more attacking right back and then have a decision to make for centre back. We'll see what happens.

1076~~~
He's lucky we didn't sign a centre half this summer because otherwise I couldn't see where he'd fit into the starting eleven. We've got many more players that are better than him in midfield and that showed tonight when he switched there.

1077~~~
Bingo. Typical redcafe. One bad game and the agendas come out.

1078~~~
That's just silly, centerbacks do different jobs in different systems. He's good in systems where keeping the ball is the primary method of defending, he isn't in systems or games where teams see more of the ball and are more likely to go blow for blow. He's <i>situationally </i>a good centerback.

Amusing but alas incorrect. Since this is a continuation of a discussion that started before this game, where I was praising him <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>. He's repeatedly struggled in games where teams have gotten at him this season where more natural defenders would have fared far better. Thankfully in general he (and the team) are very good at keeping the ball and limiting the amount this happens. Acknowledging the issues caused when our possession system breaks down and Blind is exposed isn't an agenda, which just seems a buzzword for dismissing arguments you dislike. I believe you used the same phrase with regards to my comments about Falcao when he first signed, which turned out to be less of an agenda and more of a reality.

1079~~~
There's another thread bemoaning our squad depth, and the lack of O'Shea type players to rotate in and give other players a rest.  Surely that is exactly what his role should have been with everybody fit?

1080~~~
I think this is and should be his future at the club. 

Might be a bit harsh saying this because he has done well for us but he's a jack of all trades but master of none.

1081~~~
Yes it would be but lets face it no player wants to be a rotational option.

1082~~~
your anti Blind rants are becoming a little jaded now.

1083~~~
Just no. Please stop and read before posting.

1084~~~
So hes done nothing wrong today and yet is being slaughtered, this place can be one of the most annoying places in the world at times.

1085~~~
Unpopular but he's a squad player for me. Will do a job but should not be a regular fixture at centre half/centre mid.

1086~~~
But he can be a master of being a jack of all trades!  Seriously, he's better then JOS, Fortune or Phizza, no?

1087~~~
He was all over the place for the goal.

1088~~~
I like Blind but I have to say that he was partly at fault for that first goal.

1089~~~
No offence to the lad, but I don't give a shit what he wants.  We can only play 11 men!

And he's good enough across a range of positions that he should still get 30 matches a season playing that role.

1090~~~
This is soo laughable.

1091~~~
Wait what did he do wrong today?  Not his best game but still no reason to call out for the transfer window already. 

The guy nearly assisted another goal in the first 5 minutes of the game.

1092~~~
he did well enough tonight.  No complaints fro  me.  Am loving his contributions this season so far.  Possibly LVGs best signing.

1093~~~
Thought he had a good game.

1094~~~
For the first goal he covered darmian who was out of formation.  Smalling then tried to cover blind when normally he should be acting as the last man &  valencia - umm lets just leave that for another day.

1095~~~
That goal was nobodies fault but Valencia, anybody that thinks otherwise is a cretin

1096~~~
It's not even valencia's.  Though valencia was the last man; the guy who scored beat the offside trap because he was in line with smalling blind and darmian anyway.  So am i a cretin?

1097~~~
Was a result of a series of faults, like most goals. Darmian was out of position, so Schneirdelin and Blind was covering for him. Don't know enough about the instructions to say for certain which of those two should be doing it, but I thought just one of them would have sufficed.

Blind then made the mistake of rushing out when the ball was played back. He essentially played like a defensive midfielder here. Rushing out could be argued to not have been a mistake, but he was half hearted in doing so (or simply didn't have the pace) leaving the space in the centre back positions open.

Of course Valencia was being a bit of a cretin (to use your word) in not being in line with the rest of the defence, which was a huge mistake in itself, but considering Schneirdelin (who should have been rushing out instead of Blind) was playing the Caligula fella onside, I wouldn't say it made much of a difference.

(Looking back at the footage, it was Darmian who played the guy onside. Sorry for being a cretin there.)

1098~~~
My guess is that this will be true in time. Rojo will leave, as LVG doesn't like him and he's good enough to start for a CL team like Valencia, Roma or Wolfsburg and will want out and bring back a decent fee. We'll buy an LCB and Blind will be the first choice backup to Shaw, the LCB and once Carrick leaves, fighting for 4th pick for CM play with a more offensive option (Herrera, if he stays) behind Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and a signed Carrick replacement.  

Lots and lots of playing time to be had over 55 games as the main option backing up 2 positions and getting time at a 3rd.

1099~~~
After the first goal, played well. Good player, he is.

1100~~~
He had a bad match. I dont think he was a liability overall. He is not in midfield mode for sure..

1101~~~
Thats what a good defensive unit should do. The LB goes up the pitch so the LCB moves across to cover, the RCB moves to the left and the RB comes in to the centre. The DM also drops to provide additional cover.

Valencia screwed it all up by not moving up with the line. Schneiderlin (i think it was him) was also a bit slow to cover when Blind went out to challenge for the ball, and that probably should have been his job anyway.

1102~~~
That is a weird thing to criticise Blind for! Wouldn't most CBs be only situationally good? For example, Terry was looking lost and done under various managers but as soon as Mourinho came to Chelsea again, he is looking like a world beater. This is only because Mourinho's system suits Terry's style of defending. Wouldn't Terry be a "natural defender" in your eyes? Barring the best of the best CBs, every one would be suited to particular systems only. 

In fact this is just a manifestation of a team game, that football is and why its difficult to sometimes judge individual talent. Isn't Di Maria a situationally good attacker, as he wasn't suited to PL?

1103~~~
Except we play possession football every game and you complain about him, every game. Throwing a couple of empty compliments at the player doesn't make your argument balanced. We've already had this when you made up his 'destruction' at the hands of Benteke.

1104~~~
Collective errors for the goal.

Blind and schniederlin should not be letting that player past. If he beats you, you take the yellow card in my eyes.

Blind followed the ball to close the shot, as he was the closest player (someone had to do it), schniederlin tried to play the offside - unaware of Valencias terrible position.

Smalling had a brain fart and left a great position, creating a huge space in front of De Gea.

Can't really pin anything on Blind tonight - he had an average game. After a few exceptional performances, I think he is entitled to an average game.

1105~~~
Poor game today, but he's been a very good centre half for us so far. We really do need Rojo back though; our back line is not so strong that it can cope with constant change.

1106~~~
He excellent at getting into the right position. He's fairly poor at actually defending when he gets there.

Wolfsburg had three decent moments in the box and all came from Blind's lack of aggression. 

If we have to play a midfielder in defence, I'd prefer Carrick. At least he could stand up the physical side of the game.

1107~~~
I really need to avoid this thread because it makes me sound biased when im not.  His tacklimg has been superb up until yesterday when he moved to DM and gave awag a needless foul.  Other than that i have seen him make countless clean tackles.

Maybe its just me.

Im not blaming you in particular; but the instant urge to blame him when something goes wrong seems like a way of introducing a new LCB like laporte.  Which should happen whether blind is crap or not.

1108~~~
It seems we have now got to the point where those who want to criticise Blind are resorting to basically saying "Well he wouldn't be good for another manager or in another team", that's not a reason to not play him as a centre back and I don't think Louis van Gaal cares how he'd play for another manager, he works and so far Louis van Gaal has been right despite all the preseason criticism.

A player like Herrera is quality however in the 10 role when the manager wants a second striker not third midfielder he isn't as effective, in the holding position he isn't as effective, in this system it is therefore no surprise other players have been given the chance ahead of him and only if they don't perform (Schneiderlin and Rooney) will he get his chance. Herrera is a good player.

The reason Louis van Gaal was probably never interested in a goal keeper like Cech even if he didn't care about staying in London is because he isn't a sweeper keeper and so would struggle with that aspect of performance. I wouldn't call Cech a situationally good keeper, he's a just good keeper, it just so happens this manager wants a keeper who is very good with his feet as first choice for obvious reasons.

Jose Mourinho didn't value Juan Mata because he didn't fit his system, I wouldn't say Juan Mata is a situationally good player. Benitez was happy with him as is Louis van Gaal. And so far he has averaged a goal or assist per game!

Valdes was a top keeper but in the premier league many thought he would have struggled, I wouldn't say Valdes is situationally a good keeper.

And the list goes on.

1109~~~
It's not instant. He's never looked like a centre back. I've been saying it all season. I'd like to see Jones in that position.

1110~~~
This is the second game I've commented on, and the previous one was a compliment. 

Like I said. Please start reading.

1111~~~
Like I said, please read and stop replying to what you want to see.

1112~~~
He is much less error prone that Jones.

1113~~~
I think a 34 year old Terry is the epitome of a situationally good centerback, but your leap in logic to that meaning I must disregarding his entire career previously doesn't really work. Terry would have been an asset to any backline in his pomp, even if he was an arse. That doesn't change that he's limited in effectiveness to playing a really deep line now. Giggs was situationally a good central midfielder in his later days. That doesn't mean he wasn't a world class winger previous. The difference between Di Maria and Blind is this silly technical semantic point you're trying to imply that not working in one system or situation is the same as only being suitable in a role for one systelse This is true of all of your examples withthe exception of Terry. Mascherano was fantastic for Barcelona for long periods despite notreally being a conventional centerback who would have struggled massively somewhere else. 

Playing horses for courses isn't some massive slight on Blind, he excels in our current system. That doesn't mean he doesn't struggle when the system breaks down of course but that happens with lots of players. Acknowledging that fact isn't suggesting that you want him dropped or killed, no matter how desperate some in this thread are too see the slightest criticism even when framed by a massive compliment as a devastating assault.

Players have strengths and weaknesses. This isn't big news.

1114~~~
He is much less a defender than Jones.

And Jones being error prone is based on an unfair internet reputation.

1115~~~
Bullshit. Like I said, some making things up.

1116~~~
You just read what you want to read. You're so desperate to defend Blind you can't take even the slightest criticism of him, even when framed in what most would consider to be a massive compliment. You're just being silly.

1117~~~
He has played all his career as a DM, LB and CB so it's not like he isn't a defender. Maybe he hasn't played CB a lot but he has been a defender so it's not like he does a job which he has no idea of. Plus he has the brains to adapt which he has done very well this season.

The last top team that Jones played against was arsenal where he made a hash of at least 2 half chances against giroud. One he did comically just about defend with his head. The other he tried to put de gea under pressure with his defending. Blind never screws up to that extent. Jones is a good defender but he has brain freezes very often. Unfair internet reputation? Not really.

1118~~~
No doubt it was a flawed performance from him, but one bad game in a match where others struggled too is not grounds for dropping him. Even if a replacement comes in and is more solid defensively, we'll miss his passing. Some might not realise that's what they're moaning about, but there's no question a lot of the penetration we do get at the moment in our possession-heavy game is down to his passing.

See how he does against Arsenal. If he looks frail again, <i>then</i> you think about dropping him for Jones or Rojo, or moving him to the left while Shaw's out.

1119~~~
It's unfair entirely because you describe the defending as 'comical'. It was an incredible recovery from a slip. Slips like that happen all the time, but recoveries like it don't.

Blind has been outmuscled and outpaced loads of time this season. His lack of closing down led to all three of Wolfsburg's chances yesterday, including the goal.

1120~~~
No I read what you write, the same as the several other people who quoted you after making such a ridiculous statement about being bullied by Benteke.

1121~~~
Whether we buy a new cb is only worthwhile talking about in january the earliest. Until then we got to decide to be happy with either an attacking line up or a defensive one. 

Considering the harping of LVG being a negatively and primarily a drfensive minded coach; playing blind has added a great deal of suprise and variety in our attack. 

Not a single CB in the world can assist the way blind has done this season apart from maybe david luiz. 

So what do we say here?  The fans who were pissed off by our attacking tactics want to change the defence as soon as we start scoring 3 goals a game?  

Our attacking ability has dramatically improved once de gea started playing; likewise replacing daley blind for what currently is- no reason; may change all of the good work we have been seeing.

1122~~~
The recovery was good but it was horrible defending to start with. He misjudged the ball completely, lost the man he was marking completely(giroud), he awkwardly dives forward taking the ball forward with him and almost ended up conceding a 1v1 from a harmless long ball which should have been easily dealt with. He doesn't fill me with confidence at all. 

He hasn't been outmuscled a lot like you say. He conceded one chance vs gomis which was his mistake and against Southampton everyone else was equally culpable and our defence as a whole was poor that game. yesterday blind didn't have a good game but it's a stretch to single him for the blame for all the chances. He is at best partly  blameable with darmian not able to deal well with schurle cutting in from the right. Even Valencia and Young had mistakes. For the goal, the whole defence switched off.

1123~~~
And that is the sum total of your basis for me criticising him every match despite me telling you I actually gave him MotM for said game? Like I said, you're being silly and rather bizarre.

1124~~~
Criticising someone for something that didn't actually happen seems bizarre to me.

1125~~~
I'm not sure he is tbh. Jones' errors are more obvious because he's rather less graceful but I'm not sure he makes more of them.

Blind - Jones - Smalling - Darmian looks far better than Darmian - Blind - Smalling - Valencia.

1126~~~
And that you can't see the irony in this is sad.

1127~~~
Oops someone doesn't understand the word 'irony', nice try though.

1128~~~
Arf <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> what a clown you are.

Never seen someone get so defensive over a player before. Getting mad even when someone compliments them in a way you don't like.

1129~~~
Cool story bro.

1130~~~
Aaaand you're done.

1131~~~
With you yes, until your next fantasy.
<span style="color: #ffffff">#lastword?</span>

1132~~~
Never seen someone become so defensive about a player, it's actually insane. So completely determined to get the last word in because you think blind didn't lose a few physical battles against Benteke during the first 30 minutes of the Liverpool match, as if it's grounds for whatever <i>this</i> is. Utterly bizarre, and that white text stuff doesn't actually work on about 90% of monitors fwiw.

1133~~~
Easy fishing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1134~~~
I'm sure that's what it is and not just you being overly defensive.

1135~~~
<a class="username" data-user="50019, @Dion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50019/">@Dion</a>

I think why people get defensive over daley blind is that we see a similar projection to how the likes of schweinsteiger went from being an average winger to a wonderful midfielder.

Likewise; blind in his first season at CB has good performances atleast by 70:30 ratio.  Considering its his first season at CB and he is playing games like this; alot of us can only be excited that he will overcome his learning period and become a crazy CB who assists us in defence aswell as in attack.

1136~~~
Terry is only a situationally good centre back because in situations like Louis van Gaal's system he would be exposed by the very high line and wouldn't have the qualities on the ball to build up from the back…

Obviously I'm not being serious since situationally applies to most players since if you use a player in a way that minimises their strengths and maximises their weaknesses they won't be effective.

Blind is a good centre back if you don't agree with that statement then that's your opinion.

1137~~~
Exactly. Why point it out specifically then that Blind is only "situationally" a good CB, when all you mean is that Blind has certain weaknesses that would be exposed in another system. That's true for most players, barring some absolutely top class players.

1138~~~
Because occasionally our system breaks down. Like it did vs Southampton and in the CL.

1139~~~
You are saying as if Blind is not good for anything during such times. He is exceptional in interceptions and tackles even though is a bit lacking in pace and sometimes positioning. We have only conceded only 5 goals in 7 matches in premier league, which is the joint lowest (though admittedly some teams have played one game more). So its clearly not such a problem as you are suggesting.

1140~~~
I don't think you know how much of a problem I consider it, in fact I'd suggest you're way off and reading what you want to read. I'll point back to this:
I think that says enough about my opinions on the risk/reward and I stand by the premise that this is an utterly ridiculous thing to have been dragged out for 3 pages given it was a pretty big compliment and some children couldn't handle that someone might not think their favourite player is absolutely flawless.

1141~~~
Haven't read the past three pages but I don't think anyone is suggesting that he is absolutely flawless. He had a bad game versus Southampton but he has had more good to great games versus bad games, hell Blind has had much better games than Terry has this season. As you said, people dip. Terry has certainly dipped and isn't the same player he was four/five years ago. Blind is playing his first season for us as a CB, and yet you seem to want to bash him for one bad game against Southampton. Even though he could become way better as the season progresses. He could get worse but currently he is pretty good in the CB position. He may not have Jones' speed etc. but Jones can certainly learn a lot from Blind's positional play and game reading intelligence. Hell, Blind has only been dispossessed once in the EPL versus Smalling's twice. Smalling has won more duels and tackles and has a higher percentage for both (57% v 49% Duels and  71% v 67% tackles) but Blind has scored, passed more (436 v 355), has higher accuracy(91% v 87%), more crosses (4 v 0), more long balls and much less fouls.

Hell, John Terry only has and better duels and tackles percentage but that's it albeit with way less duels and tackles recorded so the precentage will be in Terry's favour. Everything else is lopsided in Blind's favour.

1142~~~
Again you're going great lengths to defend Blind from criticism I didn't make. It's just plain bizarre.

1143~~~

1144~~~
Shouldn't have started today based on his last few performances, with the exception of the Sunderland game he has struggled recently, pace of Walcott and Sanchez could be too much for him today. These area kind of games where I don't think it is worth the risk playing him but hopefully he proves me wrong.

1145~~~
I get he isnt the most physical but they are pleanty pf CB's slower than him.  Kompany,  mertesacker etc.

1146~~~
Arf ivaldo is back. 

Utterly obsessed with me, at least you're sticking to one thread this time <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

And like I said, you don't actually read.

1147~~~
Yeah 'lack of pace' is a weird criticism to level against him at CB, he's one of the quicker centre-backs. They're not normally blessed with pace.

1148~~~
I'd rather have Carrick at CB and Blind in midfield.

1149~~~
Typical response, gets called out, proof given of this 'compliment' you keep calling it and you ignore the post completely. Care to explain?

1150~~~
Like a rabbit in front of headlights when faced with someone with pace.

1151~~~
Surprise surprise.

1152~~~
You can't play him at cb in games when we aren't dominating possession, he just can't defend well enough.

1153~~~
He works brilliantly at CB against the weaker teams, but against such a fast front four, he is getting annihilated.

1154~~~
It's fecking ridiculous to have a luxury player in central defence. He's as much a defender as Dani Alves or Robero Carlos. Nice on the ball but not up to the job description. I want defender who can actually defend.

In fairness, he doesn't do a lot wrong, but nor does he do much right.

1155~~~
A weak, small, slow centre midfielder found out at centre back against one of the best attacking sides in the league? Well I never.

1156~~~
I could try to explain the concept of context to you, but I've suddenly lost the urge to bother to defend myself for some reason... Can't think why that is.

1157~~~
Because you've decided we think he's beyond criticism which isn't the case, he's been poor this half much like the rest of the team (I've said numerous times he needs protection to be effective), it's the nonsense statements like getting bullied by Benteke, still waiting for that response, how is it a compliment? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1158~~~
Like I said, him struggling when we're not defending by keeping the ball doesn't require my defense anymore. Please feel free to keep posting, it's amusing in a very un-amusing situation.

1159~~~
Nice side step, again I'll repeat the question for the 4th time, how is this a compliment?

1160~~~
Would start Jones against Everton away. Rather play Blind as left back.

1161~~~
Feel sorry for him. Those around him have left him exposed.

1162~~~
Hopefully a real CB is playing the next game. The experiment is over.

1163~~~
With Jones fit he should be in there not Blind.

1164~~~
Everyone around him made him do a terrible clearance for the first? Or run back with Walcott for the second and not leave him offside?

1165~~~
Again, while explaining the nature of how an argument can have nuances, is expressed in relation to interaction with others and stretch across several posts sounds really fun... I'd rather just let the live action demonstration do the talking.

1166~~~
So really despite me asking on 4 separate occasions, you've been unable to give a reasonable response to a very, very simple question whilst simultaneously convincing yourself anyone who disagrees with you in this thread is unable to admit any flaw in Blinds game, which really isn't the case. Ive even stated myself you've made some good points, these echoing what I've said previously. For some reason you feel today's performance by Blind vindicates your unfounded and frankly made up attack on Blinds performance against Benteke, it would save you a lot of time and effort just to admit you're wrong.

1167~~~
So dreadfully determined to fabricate some kind of point. You think he didn't struggle vs Benteke for a while, I did, I think at some point you're going to have to accept that.

1168~~~
Haha there we be, so despite several people painfully pointing out otherwise, you're still determined to claim something happened that didn't. Not finished there, you've tried to structure an argument about myself and others not accepting any criticism of the player, despite at no point have I or the majority of others ever statement anything like this.  You've even tried to convince others they were jumping on you for 'complimenting Blind' after that rampant post I've quoted a few times, again please to me how that is a compliment?

1169~~~
Obviously a description of Blinds flaws aren't a compliment, that comment was an elaboration when challenged on what was a compliment. This is what I mean about your failure to read, there is simply no excuse for you failing to comprehend that. 

And your only material objection out of several listed is one performance, you can see why I'm not taking you seriously when I've just been shown to be correct again in sadly emphatic fashion.

1170~~~
Show to be correct again, fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> get this idea that nobody can take criticism of Blind our of your head, you've boldly stated that everyone can't read because they are getting upset about a compliment, I've shown you irrefutable evidence of the nonsense you've continue to spout and you're still trying to deny it. 

Here's the problem with people like you, you're that desperate to make a point (a point that I've said before is valid) that you'll spout mindless, unfounded crap and attack a player at every possible opportunity that what you do have to say is drowned out in your bizarre rants.

1171~~~
He's a decent midfielder and he should be played there. If we need a quality CB than we should buy one

1172~~~
You might have had a point if any of your version of events was true, alas reality gets in the way. It's not like the very first reply to my very first post which was positively gushing given the current circumstances was someone taking gumption to the idea that he's not a natural defender. A sentiment I hope we can put beyond doubt now. Every post I've made since then has been in the context of that initial post, something you disregard. 

But please, keep going with whatever madness it is that has overtaken you.

1173~~~
The day most United fans have been waiting for has arrived.

1174~~~
Please no more Blind at centre back.

1175~~~
Probably not good enough at the back against top teams.

1176~~~
left back

1177~~~
I'm suprised and a little disappointed. Although your reply had your usual casual insults you didn't state I couldn't read, that's unlike you. Still keep creating your own narrative and proving yourself correct to a point nobody actually argued with, whilst ignoring the original points made in this conversation made by myself and countless others. Throughout this you still haven't grasped the notion I've steadfastly stated he needs protection to play well, I think this is what your ramblings of what a 'natural defender' is, such blissful ignorance.

1178~~~
Should never start away from home at cb again unless no other option, awful in the first half and there is too much reliance on smalling to defend for him.

1179~~~
Sorry, it was implied.

1180~~~
You sure? Or do you just want to change the subject and then claim it happened later on? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1181~~~
We really should move him to LB and bring back Jones as a CB partner for Smalling. The Blind at CB experiment works great against weaker sides, but he's not cut out for this against top sides.

1182~~~
I don't think it would matter to you either way so take your pick.

1183~~~
He's not good enough for LB either, will get torn to shreds by the pacier wingers in the league whilst being a target for aerially strong striker to peel onto.

1184~~~
he's as good midfielder as cb and as lb, he's decent against weaker sides and he struggles against top sides... all in all he's valuable squad player but in ideal world he's not starter at any position in tough games..

1185~~~
I think arguing with your imagination has run its course

1186~~~
Lately, he has become worse and not doing too well defending wise. It might be good to play another CB and him at LB to solve the Shaw issue

1187~~~
I beg to differ. I think he would do well if partnered with Bastian or Schneiderlin in a 3 men midfield who also have a quality playmaker in it (Mata or Herrera). He's certainly a better option to Carrick (too old), Fellaini (too shit) and Rooney.

1188~~~
Has to play LB. Bring Jones in as the CB in the next game.

1189~~~
said that.

1190~~~
Oh that's good news, hopefully you'll stop talking nonsense now and lose your obsession with 'my imagination'.

Go on, have your best shot at the last word. I think I'll let todays game be mine.

1191~~~
Blind needs to be one of the midfield options. It is one thing to play him as CB when we have no CBs...but to continue to play him there when we have Jones is stupid.

Today he should have started at LB.

1192~~~
That last sentence says it all, you're arguing against a point I never made and you'll continue to do so no matter what I or anyone else say.Blissful ignorance indeed!

1193~~~
He was all at sea today, we knew he'd struggle against pace but he lost his usual calmness as well. He's not a CB for all seasons, he's great when we face teams that camp in their own half and his ability to bring the ball out allows the CM's to push high up, but there are games where he's simply not suited to the opposition.

1194~~~
I think it's horses for courses, he's already got 3 assists from CB which is one less than Memphis and three more than Rooney. He's the right choice for games at Old Trafford and away to teams who sit deep for me. Van Gaal was right to be chasing Ramos in the summer, even though Smalling's improved when the pressure is really on there's nobody in the defence to calm the team down.

1195~~~
I praise him and this happens..oh my.

1196~~~
Not sure its fair to put much blame on him today, Arsenal walked through our midfield and flanks and he and Smalling were left exposed. Even if that was Vidic today instead of Blind I'm not sure the result would have been much different.

1197~~~
Concerns confirmed.

1198~~~
The problems were down the flank. Smalling and Blind were left horribly exposed with the acres of space the attackers had against them
Maldini and Beckenbeur as a partnership couldn't have stopped that

1199~~~
Walcott ate him up. Was inevitable really.

1200~~~
Great as a ball playing defender in games we control, and have the bulk of possession.

But as most of us feared, up against a team that attacks us, in games we don't control, his weaknesses gets brutally exposed.

1201~~~
I still think he can do a job at centre half against teams which lack pace and a physical presence to their game but the trouble is most teams in the league has at least one of those attributes. Now Jones has built up some minutes it's time to throw him into the starting eleven alongside Smalling.

1202~~~
Wasn't that the same for the other back 3 as well?

1203~~~
Watching that second goal I don't put much blame on Blind, the problem is the non-existant midfield allowing the through-ball to Walcott in the first place who will of course beat most defenders for pace. Blind at least keeps up with him and squares him up but no one was picking Ozil up so he can just lay it off to him. The midfield left him and Smalling exposed.

1204~~~
Needs to just put his foot through the ball and get it clear sometimes. He tried a clever pass which led to their first goal when he should've just smashed it upfield.

1205~~~
With young  on the left we shouldn't be playing blind because we automatically become 3 at the back with 2 fullbacks instead of CB's.  Blaming blind for being slow because darmian & young get done isn't right. 

Even though every one of our defenders had an awful game; blind was only slow because he didnt capitalise on being in the right position at the right time. Thats where the blame for pace comes from. 

Smalling,  darmian & young were all out of play consistently by one through ball.

1206~~~
Get him back out at left back and linking up with Young like he did very well last season. Memphis needs to be dropped anyway.

1207~~~
Playing him is the easy out, he was far from great today but I feel the midfield should shoulder the majority of the blame, you expose any defense like these did today and they struggle.

1208~~~
I'd like to see a new LCB and let daley blind rotate between LCB and LB.  

Even though i say that; i struggle to blame him for much so far this season.  You look at the goal sanchez scored; blind was in the right position in the right time but didnt get his foot on the ball.  The rest of the defenders were not anywhere where they should be.

1209~~~
Yeah, I agree with you. Blind has done well at times this season and van Gaal clearly likes that he can keep possession and deliver passes from the back but whenever we play a team with a centre forward who's good aerially or a team that's strong on the break as you say there's a glaring weakness that's there to be got at. Even though Jones doesn't fill me with confidence, Smalling is playing very well in general so hopefully he can provide some solidity whilst Jones gets up to speed.

1210~~~
Yeah he has a habit of doing this and it can get annoying. Sometimes it's fine to just get it clear!

1211~~~
On balance, I don't like him in centre defence. There are just too many situations when his lack of pace/height/strength hurt us. A faster player would have cut out the cross for their first goal. A more careful pass, normally his strength, would have avoided the crucial second phase of their attack for their opening goal. 

Right now we have scored 12 and conceded 8 in 8 games. That doesn't scream success to me. Nor has it been a disaster.

1212~~~
I don't think there's  a debate or ever has been.

He's not a central defender. Playing him there against any team where good central defending is needed, will never be anything other than a terrible idea. This has been demonstrated multiple times now, and didn't really need to be as it was an obvious situation before the season started.

1213~~~
You can't just pick and choose one player to blame for a defensive collapse, and I can't understand why Blind is getting the blame while Smalling gets away with it. It's the latter that should be marking Ozil for the second goal and he's also the player that needlessly gives away possession with another aimless long ball to begin with.

1214~~~
Exactly.  Even for the first goal; it was blind who was closest to ozil again showing that he knows how to be at the right place at the right time.  Just because he didnt get a touch on the ball when he slide tackled doesn't excuse smalling who was no where to be seen. 

Likewise for the 3rd goal (i think),  Walcott had every defender beaten except blind who was the only one following him.  Once again; his pace is blamed even though the other three defenders were no where to be seen. 

In fact i think out of our 4 defenders; he was the only defender who was in the right place at the right time and all this blame on him is dus to him not capitalising on it. 

Either way; we do need another LCB for such games where we wont so easily keep possesion.

1215~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/anigif52u9p.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/anigif52u9p.gif"/>

For me, this gif sums up Blind as a CB.

He doesn't do anything wrong, but nor does he actually do any defending. He's closer to Walcott than Smalling was, and yet it was Smalling who runs further to take control of the situation and snuff out the danger. Blind all too often is happy to just stand there. We can't afford to carry him in central defence.

1216~~~
Seriously don't get why Blind get all blame for goals. whole defense was collapse in their goals.

1217~~~
Nothing wrong at all with Blind in that clip. He's in the perfect position relative to Walcott and as the last defender the guys in front of him should be chasing Walcott out. If Walcott had managed to lay that ball off to the Arsenal player (Bellerin?) Smalling would have been taken completely out of the game.

Some people have been waiting all season to jump on Blind when the whole defence (and midfield) were at fault.

1218~~~
Defending is more than about not doing anything wrong. It's also about doing things right. Blind could have closed down Walcott himself, but let Smalling do it instead.

I'm rewatching the game as I type this. I could have posted 7 or 8 gifs of Blind standing off his man. The clip above is just the one I happened to capture. His positioning is generally great. His defending once he's there is non-existent.

1219~~~
Cause Caf * decided that he isn't a CB a few months ago and were waiting for him to have a bad game (which he undoubdtely had, but not worse than any of our other defenders including Smalling) to repeat it. Similarily how Mata will need a couple of bad performances and Caf will repeat that he isn't a winger, despite that he has been our best onfield player sice he started playing in that position.

* By Caf I mean some agenda-driven posters, not difficult to know who are them.

1220~~~
A central defender isn't supposed to always chase his man out though. You go a few yards then you drop off again. If you follow them out you risk getting turned and leaving a gaping hole, which is exactly what would have happened to Smalling had Walcott made that pass.

1221~~~
You think that's an example of bad defending by Smalling?

1222~~~
Thats a odd example there, do you think Ferdinand would've pressed the tackle like that? I think he wouldve done exactly what Blind did, think there are some more obvious weaknesses in his game than that. He's absolutely fine if the defensive midfielder(s) do their job, as soon as someone has the opportunity to run at him and he needs to back peddle he gets exposed.

I don't think we can put a huge amount of blame on any of our defenders (Blind seems disproportionately blamed) aa they were left completely exposed far too regularly and it wasn't until we put 3 in the middle did they stop cutting us open so easily.

LVG is at a bit of a cross roads with Blind now, he can use him specifically against teams that will sit back against us and utilise his passing to pick holes, he can continue using him in a similar fashion as he is now but ensure there is always someone like Schneiderlin there who's chief job is to restrict the space between the midfield and defense or he can drop him completely, opt for a more traditional defender and sacrifice a bit of creativity.

It isn't it isn't an example of bad defending from Blind either.

1223~~~
I blame LvG more than Blind. He's not a defender. It's not his fault he's been played somewhere that he doesn't have the skillset to flourish.

Rio didn't lack aggression. He would have closed Walcott down as well.

1224~~~
It's an example of non-defending from Blind.

It's not that Blind is bad at it, it's just that he doesn't do it.

1225~~~
He most certainly wouldn't have done what Smalling did, that was very much the Vidic school of defending.  You look at Rio's tackle stats and they are pretty low, there's a lot more to defending than just putting your foot in.
No that's still defending, what you're talking about is tackling.  he doesn't commit himself unnecessarily, he ushers Walcott aware of a dangerous position and eventually has him running away from our goal, how is that not defending?

1226~~~
No, because he knew he had cover behind him.

1227~~~
You wanna see bad defending from Smalling and Blind? Here's bad defending from Smalling and Blind.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/iudt" width="560"></iframe>

feck knows why Blind thinks its okay to jog back with Walcott behind our defensive line and play him onside and allow him to get 1 vs. 1 in the box in the process... after which point, why Smalling isn't deciding to pick up Ozil - who is literally their only player in the box - is beyond me.

People say Arsenal blew us a way and there's nothing we could have done about it... well, what we could have doen was at least defend a bit competantly for the goals we did concede (the first should never have come about as Blind should have cleared his lines when he had the chance, for example). Yes, they got no protection from midfield, but that doesn't excuse them from defending poorly.

1228~~~
Yup good example. You could perhaps say Blind should've for a call from Smalling to step up as he could see across the lone whereas Blind had his back to it, then again he should've positioned himself so that he didn't need the call in the first place. 

Look at Ozil in thr build up there though,  absolutely no one is picking him up, who is Carrick and Schweinsteiger marking exactly?

1229~~~
Easy there, can't be criticizing Smalling around here. I find it amazing that I've actually read people saying Smalling was good and our second best player yesterday. He really was no better than the rest of the backline, a complete mess all around. Smalling on the Ozil goal was in the same position he is in for quite a few goals we've let in this season, the middle of the box marking no one and doing feck all. Its never his fault though, its always everyone else's fault for making Smalling do all the defending on his own. He'll charge out of the box to make a tackle or two though so he's the bestest CB to ever live.

1230~~~
He has been playing as a LB CDM and CB all his career. Not sure how can you say he is not a defender.

As for that clip you put, there is no point in both our defenders running trying to tackle him. I thought that was actually sensible that he didn't try to get in the way of smalling who was clear from the start and committed himself. I have seen Jones do that a couple of times with Evans or someone.

1231~~~
It's a shame that vid doesn't start about 10 seconds sooner because it shows how Smalling needlessly lost possession with an aimless long ball, which was mental in consideration that we had just gone a goal down and needed to steady the ship.

1232~~~
Agreed, I think he has vastly improved on the player he used to be but there's still a lot of deficiencies in his game. It was suicidal to just hoof the ball up the pitch after Arsenal had already ripped us to shreds once.

1233~~~
If Smalling's going to get criticised for that, Blind's clearance for the first goal was a complete disgrace. What the feck was he thinking? That is our ball playing centre half who's solely there for his ball playing ability, and he cleared the ball 15 yards in our half straight back to Arsenal.

1234~~~
Yep. It is Darren Fletcher syndrome. After being unfairly criticized and labelled as shit for a few years, he suddenly is on God-like position and the best human in multiverse's history.

1235~~~
This, I don't understand why defenders nowadays play like anemic little girls, they seem unable to clear properly the ball or clatter the opponents.

1236~~~
He's had a few bad games, it isn't just one. Conversely, I don't know why some people are so desperate to see him stay at CB. It isn't that he's been bad, there's just no reason to keep there now Jones is back.

1237~~~
Smalling had to play an aimless long ball as there was no other option available. He was on the ball for ages waiting for someone to show for it but the whole team was in disarray.

1238~~~
Maybe because some people will say that we are playing hoof ball whether or not fellaini is on the pitch or not.

1239~~~
It's because with jones and smallimg we get a really flat back line.  With blind in there you are able to make up to all the deficiencies smalling has.  Even if it was jones playing on the right; then it would be blind on the left. 

If this was La Liga then we would have 2 ball playing defenders but we cant do that in the premiership.  We need one strong defender &  one ball playing one. 

At the end of the day; id prefer blind in defence and his ability to unmarked assist numerous times this season than drop him only for a whole teams shitty performance.

1240~~~
Players don't give a feck about what we say.

1241~~~
I reckon at least another two avoidable spankings before Van Gaal finally realises what a stupid idea Blind as a centreback is.

The first of which may well be our next league game.

I still can't get my head around why anyone would think this is a good idea. In fact until this weekend there were plenty of people still claiming it was working. Every game in which we've had defending to do Blind has been a disaster. 

It's not his fault. He knows where to stand but he doesn't know what to do, so his solution usually is to do nothing in case what he does do is wrong. I don't blame him for that as he doesn't have the speed or strength to gain the confidence to play there...but he shouldn't be fecking playing there, for exactly this very obvious indeed bloody reason.

1242~~~
It was working, we had the joint best defensive record in the league. Saying that I would prefer to see Rojo or Jones in there.

1243~~~
Not only that but Carrick's been terrible in central midfield, so if Blind wasn't busy pretending to be a centreback he'd probably be a better option there at the moment too.

Or even left back, where we seem to try someone different every game, despite knowing Blind can do a decent job there against most opponents.

1244~~~
No it wasn't. It cost us the game against Swansea, in contributed massively yesterday. It's cost us goals in every game where the opposition has attacked us.

We HAD the joint best defensive record in the league, but we have the ball more than most teams. Also not everyone had the luxury of playing Newcastle and Sunderland at home in their first 7 games. Add to that Smalling has been playing very well...but it's very clear he's over compensating and needs a decent defensive partner.

1245~~~
At home he has been fine and against Villa. Villa were useless.

But like it's been said, when up against teams that attacked us then we struggled. For me, we should play him left back and just play Jones.

1246~~~
This. LVG was spot on when he said after the game that it was team wide collapse

1247~~~
Swansea, Southampton and Arsenal. Struggled a bit, not helped vs Arsenal by the fullbacks though.

1248~~~
Do I get to bump this then after what happened yesterday was basically <i>exactly </i>what I feared would happen eventually?

1249~~~
Shit play all round cost us at Swansea and all the team contributed massively to the defeat yesterday, including those who are playing in the natural positions. The panic in here over one result is fecking nauseating, we are joint second in the league and only two points behind City yet you’d fecking think we are in Chelsea’s position.

1250~~~
So whenever teams score against us it is always down to Blind playing in CB? Bullshit. Darmian was the worst of the lot yesterday and Smalling was just as bad. For Swansea's first goal Smalling failed to follow his man and stood there while two Swansea players were wide open in the box. For the second Darmian failed to track the runner and Smalling failed to notice the runner behind him as well. But of course those were all Blind's fault no doubt.

1251~~~
Van gaal wouldn't want hoof ball either unless we are desperate.

1252~~~
You deserve some reward.

1253~~~
When you are under pressure in your box, you have to be desperate. You hoof the ball, leave your deep positioning, press the ball carrier and allow yourself to set an higher defensive line. Now when you retake possession you pursue your possession football philosophy.

That's common sense.

1254~~~
?

1255~~~
I dont get the panic either.  Infact its games like these that might give LVG the kick he needs to give the likes of pereira and wilson a try.  Either way we are 2nd/3rd and i doubt we are going to go down rather than up.

1256~~~
Indeed. The future is looking very bright. It might not be obvious to outsiders but I'd have thought those who follow the club closely would be able to see it. 
Instant success has never happened in English football yet for some reason we are expecting it after the clubs biggest transition in recent memory,

1257~~~
I still can't fathom how we didn't sign a centre back and elect to play Blind there. Yesterday we ended up with three of the back four being midfielders, ffs.

1258~~~
That's 1 more than Bayern Munich have had at multiple times this season. Barcelona have predominantly thrived on Pique and converted midfielders since Puyol retired.

Think that entrenched view that it is wrong is more of a problem personally. Football evolves and adapts. Ball possession is king right now and midfielders, especially intelligent ones such as Blind, simply offer more than an outright defender.

1259~~~
His retention of the ball doesn't help if he gets exposed. For me we won't win any major trophy with a centre back pairing of Smalling and Blind.

1260~~~
Any exposure was down to the lack of control from the midfield in front though.  It would be wrong to pick up the defender as a fault when the midfield stopped nothing. Criticism is fair enough if he's directly to blame - like arguably a big screw up vs wolfsburg - but in this instance, him and Mike were simply unprotected and allowed to be over run.

1261~~~
No one should expect us to win a trophy this season with this team.

1262~~~
I don't expect to win anything. However, Van Gaal has spent a fortune and we're still way off Europe's best. Although I won't go into that here.

1263~~~
I reckon we have a chance of winning the most pathetic fans cup.

1264~~~
We concede goals it's Blinds fault, even if Blind weren't involved whatsoever it's LVGs crazy experiment that's cost us, unbelievable.

1265~~~
I'm with you on that, my argument is nobody in our defence played well against Arsenal. Really amazed me to see Smalling had 9% of the MoM votes on here!

1266~~~
There's no reason he can't play those long through balls from left back really.

1267~~~
No one played well for Holland tonight but I thought Blind's attitude was the best of any in an orange shirt, he never let his head drop and kept competing for every ball.

1268~~~
Tbf, he is playing under his father.

1269~~~
In what position has he been playing for Holland?

1270~~~
Defensive midfielder

1271~~~
I don't think he has it in him to let it drop, he seems like the a ultimate professional.

1272~~~
Id move him to lb, Young simply cant play there. Get Jones as cb. But he deserves to remain in the team at least. And we dont really have any good lb cover either. Rojo doesnt really impress there.

1273~~~
I found it interesting that Blind was not in the lineup and we played with more of a counterattacking approach.  He has done quite well at CB for the most part but having a more solid CB pairing might allow us to use that strategy more often.

1274~~~
I don't think LvG was comfortable with Blind against Lukaku and who would be.

We are going to need him against teams that will park the bus, he is a good player to have in the squad.

1275~~~
Hes also played just about every minute of every game. This last couple of weeks LVG has started to rest the odd player and he will have to continue doing so.

1276~~~
I want him to be our LB midweek. He has quite a bit to offer going forward, will help Memphis better than Rojo. Tbf Rojo deserves to keep his spot.

1277~~~
Tidy and calm when he came on, just settled things down on that flank.

1278~~~
He's very underrated and unfairly criticised. He should 100% be starting ahead of Rojo at left back.

1279~~~
One of our calmer heads. Just brings composure.

1280~~~
He's like a chess piece that can do anything.  Should start on the left against city especially sinse de bryune seems to be on top form.

1281~~~
Very classy today at LB. No complaints.

1282~~~
I wonder how much playing time he will get now. Today was such an organized defensive performance and the back four performed well with the ball, including Jones. Will Blind move back into midfield if needed there? Or just rotate at CB & LB as needed?

1283~~~
Quite a bit I imagine. Jones never stays fit and his ability to play various positions will come in handy.

1284~~~
Most expected him to become a good utility man long term and I think that will be the case.

1285~~~
Disappointing that he's lost his starting place as he's done very little wrong but can bring English a consistent pairing of Jones and Smalling excites me. I'd hope he gets the nod when we play teams that sit back, we need his passing range.

1286~~~
Did his job for me, calm head, gave nothing away and distributed into Carrick/Fellaini well enough.

1287~~~
What was the disallowed goal about? One of those things that would make you think we were trying to lose.

1288~~~
Was poor I thought.

1289~~~
Legend.

1290~~~
Somebody must have a GIF of that own goal, I don't think I've ever laughed so much during a game of football.

1291~~~
That finish, just wow.

1292~~~
I just don't know what he was even thinking with the own goal.

1293~~~
Now that we lost anyway I sort of wish that wasn't flagged offside. It would have been an absolute classic of an own goal. Plus it would have saved us the added fatigue of extra time.

1294~~~
some shocking defending at one point when he struggled to get back and let the player go on goalkeeper... not sure now if it was smalling who recovered well or Blind himself but there was huge space left by Blind who once again showed his lack of pace. The own goal was hilarious got aay with that... I liked one of his takcles but you expect a player from his position to make these. Smalling agan kept it together...

The new Pirlo/Modric is certainly not good enough for Mcnehster United to start at any positions, squad player at best, we have a good generation of defenders coming up so I hope it will be them(CBJ, TFM, Tuanzebe....) who get the chance not someone like him with average potential and protection he's given...

1295~~~
Pirlo/Modric?? Wtf is this?

1296~~~
That would have been the most incredible own goal in the history of own goals. He was several yards wide of the right hand post and couldn't have been more than a yard away from the dead ball line, under not much pressure. A double amputee could have comfortably dealt with that situation. Absolutely amazing that he somehow managed to concede a goal.

1297~~~
Wtf are you saying?

1298~~~
That own goal was absolutely baffling, I thought he was thinking the goal had already crossed the line, and was kicking it back into the net in frustration. Clearly though that hasn't happened, it was just an absolutely baffling moment. 

Coinciding with Romeros absolute howler, it certainly was a strange game.

1299~~~
I just couldn't believe it when I saw him bury it in the bottom corner. I'd love to know what happened/went through his mind when he did that because it was so weird. He was OK other than that, but imagine if that goal stood? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Would have saved us the heartache of losing on penalties, I guess.

1300~~~
The flag went up very early, he must just have seen it and knew play had stopped.

1301~~~
Play to the whistle not the flag. Referees can and do overrule linesmen.

1302~~~
The way he was holding his head in his hands suggests to me he thought he'd scored an own goal. One of those most bizarre things I've seen for a while. If we'd gone out 0-1 to that goal I wouldn't even be a tiny bit annoyed

1303~~~
Would have saved 40 minutes of last night, too.

1304~~~
Tell him, not me. I'm just saying what i thought happened.

1305~~~
Surely there has to be a gif of the 'own goal'?

One of the funniest things I've seen in a game for ages. Wtf was he thinking? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Edit: Just found it. Its so so good <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1306~~~
I thought he was useless last night, I bet he was a very relieved man that own goal was disallowed because that would've made many blooper dvds for years to come. As for that back pass I know Romero should've controlled it better but it was a stupid one to play back so I think he should be partly responsible.

1307~~~
His, and the teammates reactions says otherwise <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1308~~~
The ball had practically no pace on it at all, there is no excuse for Romero's control, Romero's gran would be embarrassed by such a poor touch.

1309~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> those reactions

1310~~~
Yea. Romero wasn't simply trying to control it. He was going to lay it to his side. He made the too common mistake of thinking about his next move before finishing executing the current move. You see it every game. Usually it's just a winger that loses it out for a throw-in or something like that but it's more noticeable and costly when a GK or a CB does it.

1311~~~
Nothing wrong with the backpass, Romero took his eye off the ball, bizarrely tried to shift the ball with the outside of his foot instead of the instep. The final was golden though.

1312~~~
Looks like he didn't mean it then! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1313~~~
It was a really poor backbass. No keeper wants to deal with a ball that is bobbling knee high off the ground. The onus is always on the defender to keep a back pass from that sort of distance on the deck.

Which is not taking away from Romero's buffoonery, obviously.

1314~~~
That's quite literally unbelievable. If an U-10s player did the same thing you'd think he was scoring deliberately. There's just no rational explanation for his decision to try and kick the ball that direction. It's proper mental.

1315~~~
This notion annoys me, that keepers seem to havesome free pass to be absolute shit with the ball at their feet unless the pass to them was perfect, most children would've been able to deal with that, it wasn't driven at him, it wasn't close range, it just bouncedonce or twice before reaching him. If that pass was from say Rojo across the backline to Jones and Jones ballsed up like that no one would mention the pass.

1316~~~
It was a poor back-pass. If I passed the ball like that to any team-mate in my mediocre five-a-side they wouldn't be happy with my inability to control the ball properly. It's easy to take a bobbling ball on the half-volley, so you can pass it along the deck. The fact Blind didn't/couldn't created an unnecesarily difficult situation. Which Romero promptly made a pig's ear out of.

1317~~~
There's just no logical explanation for it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I really hope someone asks him about it one day.

1318~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1319~~~
he is Blind so cut him some slack...

1320~~~
Still feel we need a proper ball playing cb to partner Smalling..not Blind though.

1321~~~
Not sure we do. Jones and Smalling can do enough. Can't remember us ever having a good ball playing cb in the past and we've been fine.

1322~~~
I think he's been excellent all season (except for that OG thing that didn't count).

1323~~~
It's one of those times when you know you need to do anything but kick the ball in this one very specific location. So you kick it in exactly that direction.

1324~~~
Lvg wants one in his system though..Rio was decent with the ball too in the past.

1325~~~
I'm probably one of the few that is happy with Smalling, Jones and Blind as our 3 centrebacks. Smalling is is a cert, Jones for more physical opponents and Blind for when we need that extra bit of ability on the ball against pressing teams and teams that sit back.

1326~~~
I'm edging towards us perhaps looking at one more top centre-back long-term if we can find one, but I'm more than happy with our current centre-backs for the moment, and a lot happier with the current batch than I'd have expected to be at this point last season. I'd rather play Jones against the more physical opponents, as you say, while reserving Blind for games where we're in control and unlikely to be under a lot of pressure. Of course, long-term I'd still like to see Jones ironing out any errors in his game and making the position his own, with Blind then becoming a backup option there who can also play for us in other areas of the pitch, but right now I'm happy for us to rotate.

1327~~~
The thing is you don't usually do a lot of rotation with CB's, a good back 4 is built on consistency.

1328~~~
True. But occasionally switching from one centre-back to other, especially when they both have a decent pairing with Smalling, wouldn't be <i>too </i>disruptive. Of course, I'm still hoping that Jones eventually makes the position his own and becomes a consistent starter, but until then, I'm happy to see us changing it up here and there every so often, especially when we'll have a lot of football and certain players may occasionally need a rest.

1329~~~
Rio is my favourite CB ever. An elegant defender but in truth he was nothing special in possession. He hit a lot of aimless long passes.

People need to get over this ball playing CB rubbish. All any team needs at CB is two good defenders who can defend against quality attackers, organise the defense and keep clean sheets. If they are a threat from set pieces its a bonus. As for ability on the ball they should be good enough to consistently get the ball to a midfielder and not lose the ball in the wrong areas of the pitch. That's literally all that's required. Give me that much and I'm ecstatic.

They do not need to be expansive passers and they should not need to carry a creative burden or have any real effect on how the team plays. How many CBs in world football really have a major impact on how the team plays or how many chances a team creates? Do they really play in an area of the field where they can do that? There are 8 other outfield players who play further forward. If we are looking to our CBs to dictate play our team is simply not functioning correctly.

Smalling while not having much luck in front of goal this season has had more of an attacking influence from set pieces alone than just about any CB in football has had through passing or being great on the ball.

1330~~~
Believe me, this and the left footed lcb things are things I am not a huge fan of either. I was just saying it as its one of Lvg's obsessions. So thats one thing he'd definitely consider.

1331~~~
Fair enough. Wasn't really aiming it at you. It's something I've been meaning to say for a while. I'm sick to death of hearing people trying to reinvent football to suit a narrative or justify decisions like playing Blind at CB.

1332~~~
Why? Granted, a defender's main priority should be defending, but being a good footballer can often be an important part in that. I don't see what's wrong with wanting to have a centre-back who's comfortable on the ball, and is able to competently pass it to the midfield from the back. Yeah, it's not completely integral, but if you're given the choice between two centre-backs with equal defensive ability, but one is very good on the ball, while the other is terrible, then you'll naturally opt for the one with better ability on the ball.

It's a bit like strikers. Yes, you want a striker to primarily score goals, but you'd ideally want one who's an accomplished player in general and isn't merely limited to being a finisher alone.

1333~~~
That literally couldn't be more obvious. I was responding to a poster who suggested we NEEDED a ball playing CB

I said in my post that defenders should be able to pass the ball into midfield and comfortable enough on the ball to to give it away in the wrong areas. They need to be able to do the basics. They don't need to be great ball players.

1334~~~
Personally I don't see Jones making it as a long term starter, but if we are going to try then this season I think he needs to start at least every PL game with Smalling to try and build up a real partnership and get used to thriving no matter who we face.

1335~~~
You must be aiming at LvG then as people saying it are simply going off what the manager has stated he wants and how he feels it is important to have a CB that can bring the ball over the halfway line and be comfortable passing it under pressure. It's the Dutch way and it's how Barca play which is what LvG likes, so he is trying to mold us that way, it's why he didn't bother with Otamendi, he already had Jones and Rojo for the dog work CB style.

1336~~~
They don't <i>need </i>to be, but it certainly helps. I do think clubs should be working to ensure that when young defenders are being developed, they're as good on the ball as possible. I got the impression that you seemed to be more against this, with your comments about it being an unnecessary reinvention etc.

1337~~~
Well that's just daft. Being good on the ball is obviously better than not being good on the ball. I'm not against players being good on the ball. At the highest level central defenders do need to be able to play a bit. If they are great on the ball that's a bonus.

Realistically though, having a great ball player at CB isn't going to make that much difference to how the team plays. They wont be overly involved in attacking areas and teams certainly shouldn't be depending on CBs to dictate play. Beyond a certain level of competency it's just not something that's going to be that big a factor in how effective a CB is. The biggest factor is how good they are at stopping the opposition from scoring. Great defending is an art form in itself. One that seems to be undervalued by many on here.

I'm aiming it at him and people who agree with him. I'm aiming it people who were happy to have a midfielder playing at CB because his passing was so important to the team and the way we play. It's a load of crap. CBs should be picked on their ability to keep clean sheets. Their defensive contribution is infinitely more important that how they contribute to our play.

Barca's defence has been their only weakness over the years. It's the one part of their team I wouldn't choose to emulate. They have got away with it by being bloody brilliant in just about every other area. If we had their team we could "innovate" as much as we want at the back.

1338~~~
It was important to how we are trying to play though, Blind started off a number of attacks for us with his incisive use of the ball, and in fairness created a number of chances thanks to being able to stride into midfield on the ball and use it effectively. The other reason people liked Blind in there was his brain, where as Jones is as thick as week old porridge and prone to regular lapses positionally. Of course the flipside is Blind has had issues physically and against pace, basically if you could mesh their best qualities together you'd have the ideal CB.

1339~~~
Is Blind really that much more astute than Jones when it comes to reading the game? I think his gracefulness, and Jones' very obvious lack of it gives that impression far more than is actually the case.

1340~~~
I dont like him at all in midfield, he can do an excellent job as a cb against teams that will sit back 11 men behind the ball though.

1341~~~
I think Blind is a good reader of the game personally, it's partially how he overcame his physical unsuitability for the CB role in the PL. Jones on the other hand is often rash and has to recover with his pace after misreading a situation.

1342~~~
Good game from him I felt, him and Rojo got roasted for pace by Bolasie on one occasion but most will against him, however his intercepting and distribution was decent throughout.

1343~~~
I was disappointed by his performance. Losing aerial battles was hardly a surprise but I expected more quality in his distribution. Very slow to release the ball forwards. Perhaps there weren't enough runs being made.

1344~~~
He was struggling a little, got done by pacey Palace players a couple of times. If he didn't have Smalling alongside him he would get eaten alive.

1345~~~
He's been great. Solid throughball to Mata and has kept the striker pretty quiet. Hasn't had that much to do but on the ball he's been excellent.

1346~~~
One of the best passers we've had at this club. Range is brilliant. How many times has he played a gem of a pass from the CB position this season?

1347~~~
Fully agree. This sort of game where we're dominant territorially is made for him at LCB.

1348~~~
Very good tonight. His touch and passing is such an asset when you have so much of the ball. That Doumbia chance was a catalogue of errors from everyone but aside from that my man of the match.

1349~~~
Man of the match. He was absolutely flawless tonight.

1350~~~
Very good performance, when games are set up like this one he's very valuable in that CB role.

1351~~~
Very good for the most part. Excellent in possession and defended well.

What the feck was he playing at here though? Two CSKA players waiting for the cut back. Seemed to just decide not to bother getting back in to defend. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/fm9f" width="560"></iframe>

1352~~~
Out of position, and easily out-muscled and out-paced in that phase of play. A bit disappointing that he completely gave up the chase, too!

He plays like a midfielder in defence, because that's what he is. Great passing, but little presence. To be fair, he offered just about enough today, given that Smalling was in beast mode.

Overall, a decent performance, but only because he was hardly called upon to do any defending. I'm just glad that Doumbia didn't play from the beginning. Blind was targeted by him in the away tie and I was afraid the same might happen today.

1353~~~
I thought he was pretty good. His effort in that clip is pathetic though.

1354~~~
That didn't happen. Blind didn't start in Moscow. He came on for Rojo by 65th minute or so and by then we were dominating the game and we were hardly required to defend.

1355~~~
Don't let that get in their way though.

1356~~~
Immaculate on the ball today, he's a big asset at CB in this type of game.

1357~~~
He is great for our possession style. So calm and assured from the back.

1358~~~
Pretty good game. These kind of matches are perfect for him really. Would like to rotate him with Jones in games we are going to be put under more pressure.

1359~~~
His weight of pass is insane. Draws in opponents who can't quite intercept and give our guys more space. Agree that he's one of the best passers I've ever seen in a red shirt.

1360~~~
He is really a great option to have in the squad. Put him at CB, LB, CDM and he can do a decent job. But at CB he has really been a revelation this season. We can keep rotating him with Jones till the latter get's fully fit. 

I think Blind is a great option against teams who want to park the bus. He loves those runs in the midfield and can play some important balls over the opposition defence.

1361~~~
A great reader of the game, immensely intelligent.  Our best ball-handling defender <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.  Another success from truly mental LVG.

1362~~~
He's pretty much the perfect type of player to have in your squad.

He's never going to dazzle you, but he passes superbly and reads the game very well. He's great to have as an option when we're up against teams like West Brom who sit back and concede space, allowing us to work the ball around. It's practically cheating to be that good of a passer from the CB position.

1363~~~
...so no ones gonna talk about that pass?

1364~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again, our best passer, he has a pass like that in him every game.

1365~~~
He's an unreal passer, but his best passes are those amazing high balls that he lobs into the box from ... yeah just about anywhere from the pitch. He can pick out a pass but is not always quick enough.

1366~~~
As reliable as usual and should have had an assist.

1367~~~
His raking diagonals are phenomenal. The one for RvP's wonder header just instantly comes to my mind.

1368~~~
The guy is a top signing and an asset to any team. His passing is even better than Schweini's. And he also proved that you don't need usain bolt's Pace and build to be a PL defender. He even overran anya (I think) for the ball once today.

1369~~~
Such an intelligent footballer.

1370~~~
Good performance, was one of our best IMO. Superb passer of a football.

1371~~~
That ball to Lingard, hit first time, was just a beaut. I think I would have just run around the house sliding on my knees untiil the final whistle if Lingard had dinked that in.

He's fecking mint at that diagonal ball from deep left. The positions he can play, his passing and his tactical nous, pound for pound he was a great signing. Never seems to get injured either. He's tough and gritty, but a classy footballer. Seems to love the club as well. Him, Basti and Ander seem like mad United fans.

1372~~~
Just thinking of all that outrage at Blind at CB makes me laugh now. Who knew he would turn out to be pretty damn good there.

Yes I know he was a LB today, but still.

1373~~~
Blind being good is generally a formality, wherever he plays.

An inspired signing given the fee.

1374~~~
Great purchase at about £15 million.

1375~~~
Perhaps this Louis fella knows a <i>little </i>bit more about football than us Caftards.

1376~~~
Never that.

1377~~~
His distribution even last season when he moved to left back was phenomenal. He is required to do a lot more when played in midfield but from defense, he has the view of the entire field and he makes it count. Such a good footballer despite his athletic limitations.

1378~~~
He's still a solid option as a #6, to be fair to him (based on last season anyway). He's a solid footballer. Very glad we signed him. His love for the club seems enormous to boot.

1379~~~
It's funny as before the season started quite a few people thought he'd struggle to get a game. His average rating on here should be higher than it is I think, he's not even in the top 10 highest rated for us this season, some people just want to see him fail it seems.

1380~~~
I think we, as a collective, are perhaps guilty of taking Blind's performances for granted. Here we have a player who plays all over the park, gets stuck in, creates chances from just about anywhere, seldom makes a mistake and is one of, if not the most, reliable player in possession of the ball. He does good things all game, every game, and we more or less just accept him for what he is.

He's a truly excellent footballer. The point about his athletic limitations is a fair one, however. 

I think it's been said before, but he'd be one hell of a footballer if he had the physicality and pace to match his brain and ability.

1381~~~
People decided he can't play CB and won't change their mind. It was ridiculous before every game about how we were going to be destroyed because Blind was in CB. Some big strong forward was going to power bomb him and score a hattrick every game but when it inevitably didn't happen he still didn't get any recognition. It was on to the next game and how that big strong forward was going to turn him into a personalized Daley Blind backpack. We've the best defence in the league and he has been a big part of it and has been great all season. Some people just won't give him the credit though and will just believe that Smalling has been playing in 1 man backline.

1382~~~
Any gifs of that amazing long ball to Lingard?

He's spending too much time with Memphis.

1384~~~
Why hasn't he been taking all our corners?!

1385~~~
Is there anything this guy can't do?

1386~~~
He makes long balls look eloquent.

1387~~~
Terrific, wouldnt mind seeing him in Basti's position when all our defenders are fit. His ability on the ball and passing range is supreme. Creates one clear cut chance from defence every game..

1388~~~
He's the most positive passer in our team right now. Wouldn't mind seeing him in midfield for a few games.

1389~~~
His composure on the ball when pressed is class. He just takes one step and sends his opponent the other way, then finds the right pass.

His corners have been excellent too. Especially that inswinger which Schneiderlin almost prodded in. Why doesn't he always take them?

1390~~~
its because hes got time on the ball, wtch him go to the midfield nd being found out...

1391~~~
but I have to say hes the best corner takee weve had for a while not quite consistent but at lest he hits it with pace and good whip

1392~~~
He was generally decent enough in midfield last season. A solid, consistent and reliable passer. I don't think he was ever particularly inventive or forward thinking: he was fairly conservative in his passing, but he was still always a decent option to have there nevertheless.

1393~~~
How would you know? It'd be his first time playing with proper midfielders instead of the 4141 with ADM/Herrera, Fellaini, Young en Mata in front of him. You wrote a player off on basis of his first season, in a new league in a struggling team with a new manager. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1394~~~
He should be our first choice on corner duty from now on.

1395~~~
great use of smiles, slow clap. hes only a makeshift midfielder that everybody sees, he wouldnt do much worse than basti today though, and im not writing him off I just think we have better players to play in midfield and blind has been decent form aas cb let him play this its our advantage to have cb like this

1396~~~
he was consertvative and often questionable defensively, outmuscled and outrun alot, beingrelible passer is not enough

1397~~~
So he is defensively questionable, out muscled but he's doing a great job at CB vs PL strikers? Seems right. He played as the only not-attacking midfielder in his first season in a new league, what would you think?

1398~~~
Looks like he's the only player on the pitch with the vision to create something, again.

1399~~~
PSV have looked much better than us

1400~~~
His long balls and crosses were superb tonight. Why was it the case that a central defender was perhaps our most impressive attacking threat?

1401~~~
Thought he was our best player tonight. Really he should have been on the ball far more than he was.

1402~~~
Anyone think it's time to perhaps give him a go in the middle of the park? He can pick out a pass better than pretty much anyone else on the side and has a high football IQ, may as well get him on the ball more. He could be a useful option in there while we are without Carrick and Schweinsteiger is lacking some legs/fitness.

1403~~~
Exactly, when Carrick is fit its no debate but at the moment it could come quite handy. Wait Shaw and Jones are still injured..

1404~~~
We're too short of defenders to let him play in there.

1405~~~
I'm becoming such a big fan of him. If he continues like this then I don't think we need a new starting CB in the summer, just one for extra depth.

1406~~~
Well that is true, but we could just about do it with Rojo moving to centre back and Young playing left back. Then if there is another injury we can always drop Blind back in there if needs be.

1407~~~
I must've been watching someone else because I thought he was poor. When he dallied over that free kick towards the end of the match pretty much summed up the night in a nutshell.

1408~~~
He did his part, one ofd the few that can say they did tonight, his accuracy over range is class.

1409~~~
Want to see him in midfield when Jones is fit. Thought he was good tonight, probably our best player.

1410~~~
I think Smalling-Jones as a tandem would offer too little on the ball against teams sitting back deep. We didn't need more confused creative play from that area tonight. 

We needed Herrera and a useful, creative and mobile footballer out there instead of Rooney and 30 minutes of Fellaini.

1411~~~
Hes become such a good player for us. He guarantees you at least one clear goalscoring chance nearly every game. Even our so called playmakers cant do that at the moment.

1412~~~
What I didnt undertand is why Smalling went forward with the ball and not him, since he's much better on the ball. 2nd, he should have gone to LB and provide more there

1413~~~
Teams often defend against us by deliberately giving room for Smalling and not letting Blind create. PSV's performance was tactically terrific. We should have moved Blind further up the pitch to build anything after Schweinsteiger going off.

1414~~~
Because teams know Smalling is poor on the ball so let him have possession.

1415~~~
I absolutely love this guy, and I am a complete idiot for doubting him at multiple stages of his time here.

1416~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/nccq" width="560"></iframe>

1417~~~
PSV were not pressing when the defenders had the ball. So it could have easily been Blind but he stayed back

1418~~~
Just about sums up his game last night. His over the top balls just seemed to have a consistent accuracy to them, finding their man exactly. MOTM for me.

1419~~~
His passing is genuine quality.

1420~~~
Why had it taken a season and a half to get this man on corners, every fecking on is spot on.

1421~~~
Noticed in the last few games, his corners are absolutely brilliant. Proper pace and whip

1422~~~
He's a fine player. Does he job well (provided no one gets in his fecking road). Him and Smalling are comfortably the best centre-back partnership we have, despite team's overall ineptitude recently.

1423~~~
He's been our best crosser since he arrived, he'd probably do a good job at left wing with a bit more pace.

1424~~~
He is just such a class striker of the ball. It just kind of fecks you up having a CB taking the corners though and with Smalling in the box too the fullbacks need to be able to cover better and today they weren't able to.

1425~~~
We finally moved him to take the corners. Instant improvement.

1426~~~
Nothing wrong with centre backs taking corners.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/phil-jones-mufc.jpg" src="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/phil-jones-mufc.jpg"/>

1427~~~
Genuinely love him as a player. He's class and think he could even do a great job at Barca in their defence. Just so good with his passing, and such a calm and smart player. Smalling's rightly been getting all the plaudits this season, but he's also been consistently excellent. Also he's very much a leader type as well. One of the few who actually tries to play some forward passes into the forwards, instead of just passing it sideways.

1428~~~
Struggled a bit at first as the back 3 looked unsure of their duties positionally and he was trying to organize, finally got to grips with the scrote though and chocked him off.

1429~~~
ssssshhhhhhhh, 
dont curse us.

Another assist for him today wasn't it? Surprised he only has 4 tbh.

1430~~~
Another pretty good performance. Really like him as a player. Glad he has been put on corner duty, finally.

1431~~~
Love watching the guy play. Intelligence personified!

1432~~~
He's consistently good for us. Consistently one of our better players.

1433~~~
A bad Blind is still a good Blind, ditto Herrera.

1434~~~
Delighted to see he's popular on here. 

That nonsense with the fans screaming doom about him at the beginning of the season was embarrassing. Scored one of my favourite United goals against Liverpool too. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1435~~~
Love Blind - his hair, his style and his girlfriend.

Hope he stays here for a long time. Very likable player, and can play several roles for us.

1436~~~
He's a proper mindfeck in the way that everyone hates the 'philosophy' shenanigans (rightfully so I think), yet Blind is pretty much the personification of Van Gaals actual ideas about football and everybody seems to love him (again rightfully so).

1437~~~
To an extent, sure. He's just an exceptionally versatile and intelligent football that would really fit into almost every type of football system. I don't think he in particular whole heartedly personifies Vangle's particular system.

1438~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiDlvaRWPvE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1439~~~
Another surefooted performance defensively unless he had some feck ups in the first 15 minutes as I couldn't find a stream at first. Oddly he didn't get on the ball as much as he usually does in these type of games.

1440~~~
Two idiotic blunders early on, but did pretty well from then on.

1441~~~
He fecked up in the first ten minutes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> gave the ball away and watched as Moses missed when he should have buried.

Other than that though you are right he found his feet after that.

1442~~~
West Ham's two best chances came from Blind errors. Other than that he was okay.

1443~~~
He started poorly but did get better. Wasn't one of his better matches though.

1444~~~
His decision making was all over the place today.

1445~~~
He was all over the show yesterday and a couple of his mistakes very nearly led to goals.

1446~~~
Every chance they created came down his side; it's not necessarily his fault, but something Evra would always be slaughtered on here for. He looks completely lost when someone runs past him. He just stops, basically. Good range of passing and has been solid, but yesterday was not his best match.

1447~~~
Yeah I've noticed this. he gives up far too easily. Happened against Moscow as well.

1448~~~
The Sun voted him as Star Man yesterday

1449~~~
Loved his simple tackle in the box against Draxler there.

Excellent corners again tonight.

Play him every match.

1450~~~
Pathetic defending for their second goal and gave away the free kick for their first! Yes he's great!!

1451~~~
He's excellent for going forward, but looks a bit exposed in defence when he's up against a dangerous attacking team like Wolfsburg tonight.

1452~~~
Smalling's having a horror show as well for once, so isn't covering for him as he usually does.

1453~~~
So because he's in defence he gets the blame? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Not BFS or Smalling's fault?

Whole defence messed up. Blind couldn't do much if you rewatch it.

1454~~~
He was clearly at fault for the second and he gave away the free kick for the first. Was it his man for the first? Not sure but if so that is even worse. He plays well when we have the ball but is a weaknesses when we don't. Not on the same level as Dante.

1455~~~
What about varela?  If anyone should be the last man it should have been him.

1456~~~
Not sure what you mean buddy?

1457~~~
Our best player in the first half.

1458~~~
Exactly what i was thinking wouldn't have another CB instead of him.

1459~~~
Had a blunder like the one against West Ham early on, but overall a very tidy performance.

1460~~~
He is the least of our problems. Pretty solid performance compared to the rest of them.

1461~~~
I wonder if he will be given a go in midfield again, at times he seemed the only one capable of finding a pass.

1462~~~
When Smalling and Jones come back, I'd like to see us try this.

Also, his corners are brilliant. Always manages to whip them into a dangerous area.

1463~~~
Maybe try him and Schneiderlin, give Morgan freedom to press higher up the pitch.

1464~~~
Them with Herrera in front as the #10 would be pretty interesting.

1465~~~
So you want this:

--Jones-Smalling-

Schneiderlin-Blind

------Herrera-----?

Don't think you are on to something other than even more boring football. No ball playing centre backs, two defensive midfielders and a box-to-box midfielder. I can't picture that working out.

1466~~~
Blind and Smalling are a fantastic pair that harmonize perfectly, the only part of our outfield line up that is sorted.

1467~~~
He realised quickly that Schweinsteiger wasn't doing anything so started doing his job for him.

1468~~~
He really needs to play in Midfield. Its clear that Carrick is well past it and can't do the job anymore. BFS has been surprisingly poor in midfield as well. I really feel he can do a better job than both of them. He has got the legs, great ability to read the game, can pick a pass, and unlike our other midfielders can have a pop at the goal too. I really want him to play alongside Schneiderlin, he can't be any worse than Carrick or BFS.

1469~~~
I think that transition might happen as soon as next season once we find a ball playing center back. He is the natural successor to Carrick's midfield role and a combination of Schneiderlin - Herrera and Blind offers a bit of everything.

1470~~~
I think he benefits when playing as a CB that can bring it out in to midfield and pick his passes with much less pressure on the ball than he'd get playing as an actual CM.

1471~~~
Our converted midfielder is the last defender standing...

1472~~~
I was unconvinced by him last season, despite his early-season form as a CM & then his good run as a LB, but I think he is now one of only three players who simply has to start every game when fit (alongside Smalling & DDG), regardless of where he plays. His class on the ball adds so much to our play. Imagine him with Arsenal's attack in front of him - he'd get 20 assists a season from the centre of defence.

1473~~~
Unbelievable.

1474~~~
I like Blind, he is one of my favourite players in the squad, and I am one of few people who defended him a lot last season,  but I think people are overrating him as a CB just because of his ability on the ball. I think it simply isn't enough, because he simply doesn't have the body(no homo) for a defender, and he is too slow.

IMO, he is better midfielder and a LB/LWB than a CB. Having him as a defender is good against shit sides who you dominate for 90 minutes, but we aren't doing that often enough so that's why I think we shouldn't rely on him there in the future. Saying that, I still like him more than both Jones and Rojo. I think Jones is better CB in general, but he simply isn't reliable. And I would have Blind in the side always because he is simply very good player, but not as a CB all the time.

I am quite sure our defence will be poor now that we are missing Smalling who meant Blind a lot, even if our other first choice defenders/fullbacks return to starting XI.

1475~~~
Defensively he has shown he's more than up to the task (providing we have an actual DM to stop players getting the run on him) those claims of being exposed by strength and speed seem to have all but disappeared. He's also become integral to our attacking play, he's so positive on the ball and I almost expect something to happen when he's in possession, you can see the team ahead of him come alive and more often than not he'll find someone on the half turn.

1476~~~
Smalling is a beast but he can't pass the ball to save his life. Only about 20% of his long passes reach even close to our players. I think Smalling needs blind as much blind needs Smalling if not more.

1477~~~
Smalling is fine in terms of distrubtion, you don't know what you're on about.

1478~~~
Well, it's ~40% actually in comparision with Blind's ~55% which isn't that bad actually if Blind is the best in the team when it comes to that and the reason why he is playing in defence.

But yeah, carry on.

1479~~~
I have seen both of them attempt long balls and Blind is miles ahead in that aspect. He can even see an opening much better than Smalling does. Most of the time Smalling misjudges the weight required on the pass. Anyway the point was that i think it does Smalling a lot of help to delegate most of the passing from the back so that he can concentrate on the actual defending which he is undoubtedly the best at.

And Blind plays in defence because he is very good at tackling, intercepting a pass, maybe better than a lot of actual CBs in the league. It's not as if the only reason he plays is because of his passing.

Obviously it's not as if he can't pass. He can pass very well to players around him but long ball accuracy may be very low.

1480~~~
Well, I agree that Blind is better passer, but it's not like Smalling is that bad as you said. 40% succesful long balls in comparision with Blind's 55% isn't really that bad. I posted Smalling's passing chalkboard in his thread few games ago after people criticised him for his passing and his map actually looked more creative than our actual midfielders' map. It just shows that people see what they want to see. 

Anyway, it's quite clear who the better defender and who means more to our defence, considering van Gaal even dropped Blind few times this season(including City game where Jones started even though it was his first game after the injury). As I said, I am sure we will realise how important is Smalling in next few games. But we might play defensive football so who knows. 


As for the bold part, yes, it mostly is. Do you see Blind playing for other teams in the league who defend deep or just don't play possession football no matter how good he is at those things you mentioned(and he isn't that great in those things either, not even in his natural position where many people actually questioned his positional awereness quite often here).

Btw, to make clear again, I like Blind, he is one of my favourite players in the squad and probably the bst van Gaal's signing IMO, and I think he needs to start for us in pretty much every game, just not as a CB all the time.

1481~~~
i think it might be because of his looks, but apart from his passing, he offers nothing to the back.

Weak in the air, his bad positioning always puts pressure on his team mates, not the best at timing tackles, not the stronger tackler, slow... i can keep going.

Its not easy to be a CB... so i wont blame him totally. The boss is the one playing him there... he "knows" what he is doing.

hopefully Phil Jones will be back soon and Blind can go back to cover for midfield.

1482~~~
Its shocking isn't it?
Our defence still remains one big stack of fragile glass.

1483~~~
It will be interesting to see how Blind goes without Smalling next to him now. Hopefully he can maintain his performance level.

1484~~~
In Daley I trust.

1485~~~
I'm not convinced by Blind. As a poster pointed out on a previous thread take out DDG, Smalling, Martial and Shaw and the rest I wouldn't care less who left. Players like Blind are ten a penny in the PL, he's no better - or worse - than any utility defender plying his trade at Norwich, Watford or Bournemouth.

1486~~~
But he's left footed.

1487~~~
Is it why these big strong, fast players keep scoring bucket loads past him? He's weaknesses are excessively overrated and people like to pick up on isolated instances I'm an attempt to justify themselves.

1488~~~
I find it fascinating how divisive Blind is amongst fans. 

Some people do seem to have decided that because he's not big, tall and 'hard' looking that he can never put in a good performance this season.

Some of the criticisms I've seen in the last few pages: bad at tackling, poor positioning, causing trouble for his team mates...

I despair - I just don't see any of that at all. His tackling is excellent, he wins most battles that the vultures here predict he will lose and 9/10 times, he is the personification of composure, both with and without the ball. 

Some even have the audacity to say they can't wait for Phil Jones to return? Deary me, how low (and bizarre) supporters standards can be. 

If Daley Blind isn't a Manchester United player, Phil Jones hasn't got a hope in hell of ever being one.

1489~~~
Have you watched him play at all this season? He has proven week-in, week-out that is not the case, particularly in the latter two cases. Yes, aerially he is not dominant but he can and does win the ball when in the air; he did it loads first half v Wolfsburg.

I agree we can push for better players at CB but full marks to LVG for moving him there in my opinion. I think he's been brilliant and definitely our no. 2 centre back.

1490~~~
Big fan of Blind but he has been struggling a bit at CB recently and isn't the long term answer there. I'd actually like to see him in midfield with Schneiderlin.

1491~~~
Disappointing performance, not able to organised defense.
We seriously need new CB as Paddy is not ready and we can't relay on Jones.

1492~~~
A lot of mistakes today from Daley.

1493~~~
He was basically Kindergarten Cop today but contributed to the mess with a couple of really rash positional lapses.

1494~~~
Absolute disaster and if not the WW1-like injury list, shouldn't even travel to away games ATM..  Put him to the left-back for good, that's his best position.

1495~~~
Was horrendous.

1496~~~
Without Smalling defending for him he gets found out.

1497~~~
Even with Smalling he sometimes gets found out.

But that's largely because he's not a defender.

1498~~~
Why can't we just fecking play him in midfield where he's supposed to be

1499~~~
How is he not a defender? He's played in defence a lot more throughout his career than he has in midfield.

1500~~~
When people say defender, Ithink they mean CB. Left back maybe yes, hes played there. But he reminds me of Neville playing as CB.

1501~~~
Well there is a huge difference there. A LB is a defender.

1502~~~
I don't think its 'getting found out'. His game reading and ball skill is an excellent foil for a proper defender who organises things and gets stuck in like Smalling does. Today he was marshalling 3 kids and you could tell he was expecting them to know where to be, and was getting caught out when they didn't. He's not a leader and thats not a problem, but we didn't have anyone out there today who was. Carrick shrunk.

1503~~~
Well duh, but its used interchangeably (even if incorrect). Dont know if its because its easier, but when people say defender, they mostly mean CB.

1504~~~
He's done way better as a CB than I thought he would but long term it's not ideal.

1505~~~
Fair enough, I can't say I ever knew people did that.

1506~~~
Nail on the head. Smalling is almost the last defender on purpose.

1507~~~
I think using Blind at CB has been a success, broadly speaking. As evidenced earlier in the thread I was probably one of the most sceptical when it was clear from pre-season he was going to start there, thinking he'd be very easily targeted and exposed against pretty much any EPL striker regardless of their skill set. 

It hasn't turned out that was because we boss possession and because Smalling has been so good. A few months ago I'd have said the latter point is hardly worth considering because that's kind of like saying "Rooney doesn't need to score or link the play up because Martial does that", and I still think there is some truth to that and we clearly need another CB in the summer unless Jones can stay fit and show some considerable improvement. He shouldn't be playing in games where we won't boss possession or are against teams with genuinely good forwards, or with big burly forwards really. Pelle gave him a torrid time and he was in knots against Arsenal, I think LVG learned his lesson there because he brought Jones into face Lukaku at Everton was a good move.

Against weaker teams, however, there is definitely advantages to playing him there. I expected that he'd be nice and tidy, very adept at bringing the ball forward and finding accurate passes into MF. What I didn't really foresee was his ability to find incisive through balls to our forwards from CB, which has been a real weapon and one that I think will continue to create chances against teams who sit deep.

1508~~~
He is so painfully average. Shouldnt be playing here.

1509~~~
He was poor today but painfully average?  Hush man.

1510~~~
Can't run for shit. Nor control a football. Has no idea what to do on the fullback position and is not good enough to play through the middle. An average player that is lucky that our manager is a countryman of his.

1511~~~
He is nothing more than a squad player. An decent option for a couple of positions.

1512~~~
Very poor game from him.

1513~~~
Yep, not more though. No idea why we even went for him. We should be aiming higher.

1514~~~
agreed.

1515~~~
Been shit for weeks.

1516~~~
It's tough work playing a flank on your own. Depay's movement and positioning for passing options on the left is absolutely shocking. Blind looked dead on his feet in the last ten minutes.

1517~~~
His set-piece delivery was good but the rest of his game was off, he even got sloppy on the simple stuff on a couple of occasions, which is unlike him.

1518~~~
This. Blind is a very intelligent player and passer. Personally been surprised by his development here; he's still athletically a liability but he has changed his game to minimise that i.e he will only get beaten on raw pace/power and on standing tackles/starts he's done well to shepherd the play defensively (in contract look at Phil Jones, athletically all there with a thick as sh|t brain). Is he first team material? For Utd's stature he should be borderline, for today's standard, he deserves to be there for ability.

On merit and performance there aren't many who deserve it based on LVG's time here.

1519~~~
Superb passing, vision, touch and a very intelligent player, unfortunately he's playing in a malfunctioning side and is playing well below his bast, like most of ur players.

1520~~~
If we didn't have such a huge injury crisis he would be dropped by now without a doubt. He's been poor for weeks now.

1521~~~
Does he infuriate anyone else with his lack of fight? I have seen so many counter-attacks against us this seasons where he just gives up, puts his hands on his head and strolls back. Yeah he is slow but he could at least <i>try </i>and get back. Anyway, a bad game. Struggled with Redmond's pace I thought.

1522~~~
I like Blind and think he has a lot of value; he should be our O'Shea (and there's nothing wrong with that.)

1523~~~
I agree. There's definitely nothing wrong with that. O'Shea often played 45-50 games a season too.

One of the best of LvG's transfers, IMO. Despite being mostly a utility player, he's still one of the top 3 passers in the squad.

1524~~~
He lacks physical presence to become our O'Shea

1525~~~
i'm a huge fan of his, i don't agree with the post above about lack of fight.

1526~~~
At our most defensively strong time -  him & smalling complimented each other better than jones & rojo did with anybody.

1527~~~
its just his critics coming out of a shell after a couple of bad games. Doesnt matter that the likes of Jones and all, the fighters, were useless as well

1528~~~
He definitely does give up once the ball has gone passed him. Instead of chasing it back and taking a chance they might get held up, he just stands there and watches what happens - very frustrating.

He did it in the first goal against Norwich. Something which was completely his fault aswell. He followed Redmond all the way into midfield and instead of getting back to the LB position he ends up ball watching like a midfielder and lets Redmond get in behind him. It's a shame as he's done well at CB, but we cannot rely on him being a left back against pacey wingers IMO.

1529~~~
The worst defender on the pitch yesterday was Phil Jones and this is the thread I see getting bumped? 

Bizarre.

1530~~~
I prefer him in the centre too, even CDM. For me the bigger disappointment is Memphis. He offers nothing in terms of tracking back. He deserves a lot more criticism than he is getting.

1531~~~
True but the RB rarely ventured forward, a defender has to be reliable 1v1, you can't always rely on your winger to get back and help. That's why we miss Shaw so much, our LW could be more attacking and not worry so much about getting back, knowing Shaw will eat every winger coming forward. Sigh.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1532~~~
There was also an incident in the second half where Memphis just waited for the ball to come to his feet only too lose out. Made no attempt to tackle back. I'm really disappointed with him generally.

1533~~~
Yeah he is by no means perfect yet, seems to struggle with aggressive defenders who close him down quickly. The ability is there though, we just need to be patient and not get on his back everytime he makes a mistake - that killed Nani who IMO would still comfortably be our most creative player. Having Martial/Nani/Di Maria would have been majestic.

1534~~~
When we eventually have a top side in a year or two (hopefully), Blind should not be a first-choice starter. That having been said, he has been immense for us on many occasions since he signed, and can perform in several positions. Extremely intelligent as a player, with an abundance of quality on the ball. I agree with people saying he should be our new O'Shea (though Blind is the superior footballer). He could potentially play 40-50 games a season for us over the next 5-10 years in various positions - he may prove to be invaluable. That quality in depth (the quality of the non first XI players) is what turns a good side into title winners - it is the reason why Arsenal cannot win the league, and why we won it almost every time for 20 years.

Whether he works out at CB or not is another question - I would be very surprised to see the new manager persist with him at CB (bar the odd game in an injury crisis, assuming we sign someone this summer), but he has proven himself in midfield and at left-back already, so there is no reason as to why he should be dismissed. Some of the reactions to his performances (not speaking specifically about this game) on here are insane, whether it is a good game or a bad game. It goes without saying that he is the least of our problems right now, even if he was sub-par yesterday. I am a big fan, hope he stays for many years.

1535~~~
I'm not getting on his back, I just think his attitude is all wrong

1536~~~
I think blinds good enough to be a long term CB aslong as smalling is there.  Which is likely since he is the next captain in line.

What smalling lacks; blind has and the reverse.

This is his first season at CB (hardly even that).

1537~~~
I think Blind's career as United centre back lasts as long as van Gaal's career as United manager. Well, maybe he'll get lucky and Guardiola will join and  implement his possession game here. But unless it's one of those two, I don't see it being long-term.

1538~~~
He's in rubbish form.

1539~~~
Eh? Probably been a best player so far, of course doesn't say much.

1540~~~
Has he feck, he's been as shite as the rest of them.

1541~~~
What's he done wrong?

1542~~~
He's done nothing right.

That cross just now - <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

1543~~~
He didn't keep up with the defensive line for that arnautovic chance

1544~~~
Just slipped on the shite coming out his nappy. More interested in not getting hurt and cruising through games. Testimonial game player.

1545~~~
You mean the one where Carrick gave them all the time in the world to play the ball through to him?

1546~~~
He slips for the cross, what else, specifically?

1547~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Are you serious? Where was he for the first goal? Was he even in the frame?

1548~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1549~~~
Are you serious? That goal had absolutely nothing to do with him whatsoever, memphis was there, do you want him holding his hand? Or does he need to predict the future?

1550~~~
Blind has been one of our better performers so far today not to say that he's playing excellent thought jus the rest have been that shit.

1551~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He is the left back. He absolutely should have been there. He went for a stroll when he should be busting his gut to get back.

Stop talking nonsense.

1552~~~
He's such a light weight.  Wouldn't do him any harm to go put some muscle on, not like he's going to lose any pace is it

1553~~~
Thats why players cover for each other, we aren't playing netball. There was a player covering, this is how modern football works, beggars belief.

1554~~~
Well, modern football is clearly not working. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1555~~~
Yeah let's make our team more rigid than it already is, that'll work <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I suppose that arnautovic chance was Smallings fault because he wasn't in the centreback position from the corner? Because you're not allowed to leave your position right?

1556~~~
Na, let's keep up with modern football. It's working like a charm.

1557~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69879, @ivaldo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69879/">@ivaldo</a>  tbf you asked for a joke about modern football under van Gaal there.

1558~~~
Poor so far in the second half too.

1559~~~
Nah let's get more rigid, that's a great call <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1561~~~
What was that free kick all about?

Fecking idiot.

1562~~~
That's a phenomenal pass for Martial.

1563~~~
Partly the reason we're so crap is because we've got mugs like this in our team who are or not players United should have 

Needs to feck off back to Holland with the fraud Memphis.

1564~~~
Absolutely woeful. Would have got murdered by SAF for the amount of effort (total lack of it)  he has put in today.

1565~~~
Indeed.

1566~~~
Yeah, that's what him busting his gut to get back would have done, made us more rigid. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1567~~~
It's modern football.

1568~~~
Poor mans Gareth Barry.

1569~~~
Bolt wouldn't have been able to get back to cover that. Add more smiles = win <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously though, hes been shit, but try to keep a little perspective. when a player is covering you you don't need to go stand next to him, it's not rocket science.

1570~~~
Win? Oh! That's what you are looking for. I get it, with that thread after the Wolfsburg game and now parking yourself in this thread trying to defend an awful performance. 

You win, bud. Only one smilie this time. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1571~~~
Well done.

1572~~~
No I'm not, as I've said he's been shit, this half but just because I believe he's been shit doesn't mean I need to make up additional things to criticize him for.

(See how I was able to make a post without a laughing smiley, bet you didn't think it was possible.)

1573~~~
Amazing how I did that with a bit of perspective? Try it some time.

1574~~~
After all that, an edit to mention that he has played like shit. You can't make this shit up.

1575~~~
Congratulations on still missing the point, unfecking believable.

1576~~~
I am not missing any point. What perspective? You argued against people calling him shit and then called him shit yourself. If anybody is missing the point, it's you. 

Bye for now.

1577~~~
Except I didn't. But because I had the audacity to defend a player against something he didn't do (somehow you blamed the first goal on Blind) it means I think he's great. You're that intent on criticising Blind you're actually looking to make up errors, it's a little childish.

1578~~~
I thought he was fecking awful.

1579~~~
The only child here is you. I am not blaming him for the first goal; I am saying that his effort for the first goal is symbolic of his overall performance. 

Blind deserves all the criticism he is getting.

1580~~~
Are you just pretending you didn't write this then? You seem to be lost within your own relentless ramblings. It's clear to anyone upward of the age of 4 that it was an individual error from Memphis yet you've trier to implicate Blind in it.

1581~~~
What is the difference? He should have made a better effort to get back.

Are you thick or pretending to be?

Anyway, I am done. Your posts are a waste of time.

1582~~~
What's the difference? You just said you didn't blame him! As I said, lost in your own ramblings, has there ever been a more apt username...

1583~~~
Had a mare, struggled with Shaqiri in the first half and then with his studs in the second.

1584~~~
Looks a pale shadow of a player from last season. With more and more emphasis placed on quick players playing up front, he's just too slow to play at the back.

1585~~~
Better today, his partnership with Smalling has been the one successful choice LvG has made this season.

1586~~~
He's very good at those through balls from about the half way line.

Also we should stick with him and Smalling and Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger in front of them as a foundation.

1587~~~
Good passing but more signs making it clear that he's not a good defender.

1588~~~
He gave the ball away twice in dangerous area due to poor touch. No doubt Smalling's one mistake will be criticised more because it's easy to blame him for his passing.

1589~~~
You've got it the wrong way round I think? Smalling is the golden child on here and Blind has been the new scapegoat since he arrived.

1590~~~
Not really, people like Smalling but also like to criticise him for every wrong pass because he has poor technique, even though his passing is quite good these days.

1591~~~
No suprise he performed much better when he was moved centrally, he's the catalyst for so many of our attacks. Looked jaded today though.

1592~~~
I think he'd make a decent number 10. Fantastic technique and quite assured under pressure to continue picking passes out. I think he'd do a better job than Mata currently.

1593~~~
The lack of urgency in his game really pisses me off.

1594~~~
No one says Smalling isnt a good defender. Whereas people wait for one mistake to condemn the likes of Blind. I have said before that He is a much better CB than Jones Mangala and all and its true even now

1595~~~
Only a Blind fan boy could something like that. 

Jones will be still playing for us and winning trophies for us long after Blind is gone to some second tier team.

1596~~~
No white text? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1597~~~
Was confused about why he was substituted? I thought he was decent.

1598~~~
If posts could give a heart attack, this probably would.

1599~~~
His passing in open play is exceptional. everything else is a bit meh. those corners though...

1600~~~
At this moment in time, I'd like to see him in midfield again. His passing is far more creative than BFS right now. But Rojo and Shaw <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1601~~~
He'd need to be partnered with someone like Schneiderlin, although mentally and tactically he's one of the best around he just doesn't have the physical attributes to anchor on his own, I don't think the cafe would accept that partnership and remain in good health.

1602~~~
It shouldn't be forgotten as well that stepping up from CB gives him more space to pick these passes and I don't think is something we want to lose. What we need is for the attackers to make better use of it. We've got a problem in that only Martial can beat a player from a standing start it seems.

1603~~~
Seriously don't get what people see in him. Plays the occasional good pass, but for every one good pass, there'll be five or six occasions where he roams really slowly up the pitch with the ball then plays a hospital pass to someone, or just passes the ball straight to an opposition forward. 

For every bit of good defending he does, there'll be several moments of running hopelessly out of position, being beaten with ease, or running over to deal with a simple situation and then missing the ball and falling over.

He causes more problems for his own team than he does the opposition. Not that Jones has been brilliant either, but that's no reason for me to pretend someone else is doing well.

1604~~~
He's only an asset with his passing from defence, where he has time. And even then, he's not the passing maestro some make out.
From midfield, his passing is nothing special.

1605~~~
Don't know why but he pisses me off no end on the left back position. He's just way way to slow to be played there.

1606~~~
He struggled today, as a CB and LB. Needs to get back to his best soon. He might need a break but with Shaw out this might not happening

1607~~~
When is Shaw back? Can't be too much longer..

1608~~~
he needs to play in midfield. he was good there.

1609~~~
I thought he had a mixed bag of a game, some decent moments on the ball but struggled with the run one more than one occasion.

1610~~~
Not sure he makes it before March or so. They said he might even miss the Euros

1611~~~
Not a left back at all. Way too slow.

1612~~~
Terrible today, in fact I'd argue bar the first month of the season he has been crap all season. Needs to really improve.

1613~~~
Didn't have a lot to do defensively today but hit some nice passes into the forwards, hopefully his hammy is ok.

1614~~~
Honestly at times hes the only one with balls to be able to play those type of forward passes. Unless he gets injured, he should be starting every match as CB until end of the season with Smalling. Theres no point breaking up that defensive pair.

I do like at times how he comes out with the ball and becomes an extra midfielder. Hes not the quickest and can sometimes get caught out, but id rather he do that tbh.

1615~~~
He is a great passer. Not only for a defender, but some of his long-range passes are so good that regular central midfielders would be proud of them.

For all of his supposed defensive frailties, having him play it out from the back rather than pump it into the channels is so much better than having somebody like Jones who, supposedly, is more defensively sound.

1616~~~
Bottom line is- the amount of ball possesion we have it woukd be a shame not using blind's ability on the ball.  Specially against teams who sit back and dont press our defence at all.  

Smalling can handle the defensive side alone majority of the time.

1617~~~
Him and Smalling balance each other out quite well.

1618~~~
I like the fact that he can pass with purpose

I don't like the fact that most of his good defensive moments come from his own crap defensive moments.

1619~~~
Would like to see him partnering Schneiderlin in midfield.

1620~~~
The deepest lying playmaker in the world!

1621~~~
Great squad player, great buy but we need better in the starting 11.

1622~~~
He seems to have bulked up a bit.

1623~~~
Shows great bits like stepping in and intercepting the ball then bad parts by his lack of domination in their goal.

1624~~~
That's all fellaini. He's actually nodded it down to their striker.

1625~~~
My arse a proper centre half would have cleared the area. Blind was a shrinking violet going for that!

1626~~~
the goal is the fault of smalling more than Blind or Fellaini.

1627~~~
True. Blind's height certainly doesn't help in defensive situations though.

1628~~~
Eh? He's back peddling and gets a call from Fellaini, should he go for it anyway just to be macho?

1629~~~
His body shape and positioning complety wrong but that's what I saw.

1630~~~
So much better on the ball than our other players, shocking fact that.

1631~~~
Blind is 5 11. Its not like he is 5 5. 

Why is that shocking? He has been schooled in Ajax

1632~~~
True, although he's not particularly physical in general and it <i>does </i>show on occasion.

1633~~~
60 minutes iun and I thought he was having a decent game, but when Newcastle piled the pressure on he really struggled.

1634~~~
Because (paging LVG) he's NOT a defender!!

Once again, the only decent defending I saw him do all game was as a result of his own initial piss poor defending...

1635~~~
Terrible again. Seems to of gone backwards at an alarming rate this season.

1636~~~
Aye, he's fine when he's not under a lot of pressure because he's good on the ball and is genuinely quite good at passing it out from the back, but he's not so good when he's under pressure or against anyone who's remotely physical imposing because it's not really his actual position. I thought he was okayish tonight though.

1637~~~
He ain't a defender and I think we're in part negative to protect him. Put a strong defender by smalling and we'll see less bullying and we'll also see less of fellaini having to come back in the box. He does a few nice things but it's all to compensate. Oh his passings nice? He didn't take his chance when he was in central midfield. Let's bring Vidic back and just park the old git in the box and he'll clear more balls then Blind will in a season.

1638~~~
Stank up the place again..  Not a CB and LVG needs to get his head out of his ass..

1639~~~
He was bossing in Ajax as a midfielder, he would probably do a required job if he was playing instead of big Fella today.

1640~~~
It would literally be like Fergie playing Carrick there consistently as a starter when he was 25. He'd pass the ball very nicely from the back sure, and he'd probably look pretty decent in a lot of games, 'cos he's a very good footballer... but he would still be playing him out of position, and it wouldn't make Carrick a very good centre-back, 'cos he too would struggled when tasked with doing actual defending at the back.

1641~~~
He would look class in Barca's back line. He's grand when we are in control and he can spray the ball around with ease but under pressure he's a mess. All-in-all, he's not a centre back.

1642~~~
He wouldn't. Mascherano's a beast, and far better defensively than Blind. It's probably why they don't play Busquets as a CB to force in another midfielder.

1643~~~
I wasn't being entirely serious. He's not a defender at all as I said at the end of my post. The point was that his only discerning quality playing in that position is his passing. When he has time on the ball, he can spray it around well. When under pressure, he's a shambles.

1644~~~
That Jones/Smalling partnership looked rock solid <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1645~~~
I made this post in the Smalling thread, it should probably be here instead:

Blind is good at defending the way any defensive midfield of his mold is good at defending. In that, he does roughly the same job that a 25 yr old Carrick would do at centre back. He can make a tackle when and where he needs, will do a good job at reading the play and will obviously be excellent in possession.

BUT because he isn't a centre-back (and he really isn't a centre-back) then he will constantly struggle with defending that is suited to a natural centre-back. Matching players runs, intercepting the ball, staying with your man, heading and - the main one - positioning. Blind often finds himself in the wrong position when defending, quite simply because he's not a centre back.

Example, there was a point against Sheffield United where there striker had the ball with his feet, was running down the wing, and Blind manged to get himself in-between him and the ball to push him off the ball and effectively regain possession. Thing is, the only reason their player had the ball at his feet and was running down the wing in the first place was because Blind got caught the wrong side of him, so attempted to win the ball before him and completely ballsed it up.

Another example... late(ish) in the second half, Blind again did well to get the right side of Mitrovic and win the ball back from him when he had the ball in a dangerous position. The reason he had the ball in a dangerous position? A high ball was dropping down and Blind completely spooned his clearance, giving it straight to Mitrovic.

It's little things like that with Blind. He will generally be okay/good in most defensive moments... but because he isn't a centre back, a lot of the time he'll find himself in the wrong place or doing the wrong thing - and when we find ourselves under the cosh/pressure, and the amount of defending back there that he has to do increases, the more he struggles and the quicker he gets found out.

1646~~~
Not a CB. Way too slow and lacks positional awareness. Also has a tendency of losing the ball in the most comical ways, which pisses me off no end.

1647~~~
In a possession-based system, I think there's a place for him at the back next to Smalling and that's purely based on the fact that he's excellent in possession of the ball and knows which passes to play. Really useful against teams who park the bus. However, we played a completely different system against Newcastle - seemed like we sat back more than usual - and he was exposed. Regardless of which system we play anyway, I'm surprised that he hasn't been dominated more by "big" strikers. Not enough teams have pinned him back. I don't really blame Blind though. By not investing in a new CB, Van Gaal has put himself in this dilemma whereby we either play a good brand of football but defend poorly... or we keep possession of the ball, don't concede, but we don't look threatening either. That's simplistic because it doesn't taken into account how average a lot of our players have been this season, but there's only one man to blame unfortunately.

1648~~~
I dont see why he couldn't get better; so all the complaints doesn't or shouldn't change anything.  He can get as muscled up as smalling & Jones and still spray the ball. 

I think at the least- he is a fantastic 2nd LCB to have.  Better than Rojo.

1649~~~
Hes great at playing the ball from the back and his diagonals are brilliant to watch, that said hes not very strong and is too slow to be a modern CB imo. I think he can play in midfield but again his weaknesses require that hes protected by other players.

1650~~~
Just play him at left back. He did really well there last season and is generally a very good left back. Much better then Young or a youngster at fullback anyway. I'm a huge fan of his, and he's done decently at center back, but if we open up like we all hope, then he can't play center back.

1651~~~
He can bulk up though.  Off the top of my head,  benatia, mertersavker, hummels, kompany, skrtel are either the same or slower than blind.

Considering this is his first season career wide at CB- i think he is an amazing talent.

He is slow for a LB. IMO its his worse position.

1652~~~
On what planet is Kompany not faster than Blind?

1653~~~
You haven't seen him a lot I think if you think he isn't good at interceptions positioning heading and even matching player runs .His positioning is way better than many actual CBs including anyone else in our squad who isn't Smalling. You make it seem as if he is poor in everything whereas he is better than many CBs (even some of the ones at city Chelsea Liverpool and all) in these aspects. 

You are taking the whole 'he isn't a CB' thing way too much. It's not like he is a striker playing at the back. He is a defender and has been all his career. His defending is fine really. Even last night you can't really blame him for any of the goals and he did his job well. 

The whole 'he defends well after he has messed up' is again the same exaggeration. Even Vidic in his prime had lots (I mean loots) of times where he did well to recover the ball after he was beaten initially. It was one of his best strengths for me. It's a myth that Vidic (or for any other CB) didn't have to recover from a terrible error and then did it well. 

Yesterday there was a through ball to Janmaat which ideally lingard should have tracked back but Blind's timely intervention saved. There were lots of instances like this where his anticipation and awareness was very good and he made clean tackles. Does he have bad moments? Of course he does. Like every CB in the world. Especially so because he is playing a full scale CB for the first time probably at such a high level but he hasn't been bad at all. His good games outweigh bad.

1654~~~
Everytime we dont win, it seems that the critics have to be extreme, terrible? What game were you watching? Really seems to be no grey area here on the caf.

1655~~~
An amazing talent? Are you Blind Snr?

FWIW as an opposition fan I'd love to see Blind in the line-up. Blind would be a much better CB/player in Italy. Unfortunately in the PL physicality and athleticism account for a lot. The exceptions to this are the true 'amazing talents.'

1656~~~
If he bulks up chances are that it could make him even slower. No thanks.

1657~~~
Can we (and this isn't specifically aimed just at you) all make an attempt to remove this phrase from the Caf? It's starting to become one of those phrases I see the most (along with "You don't understand football if...") and ultimately, it's just a really snide and unneccessary comment. I mean, in this instance, I have obvioulsy seen a hell of a lot of Daley Blind... because I'm a Manchester United fan posting on the Caf.... just because I have a differing opinion to you does not mean I don't watch football.

Anyway... I never said he isn't good at those things, I said it's those things which he struggles with - as opposed to the things that come more naturally to his game as a midfielder. He's fine/decent at a lot of those things in fact... but I wouldn't say he's great at any of them - certainly not the standard you would expect of a top-level centre back. I'm not the only one who finds his positioning suspect either (just read this thread) ... it's not that he's horrible at it or anything, he just often gets caught the wrong side of his man/in the wrong place because he isn't a natural centre-back.

Ultimately though, if Blind was a great centre-back, then we wouldn't look so ropey pretty much every single time we come under pressure in games.

1658~~~
I still think he should play with Smalling as CB until the end of the season. for me the newcastle game was bit of an oddity (so far) in terms of pressure on him. I honestly think we avoid two of the goals if we have a better midfield in front of him who can keep the ball - lack of Carrick or Basti hurt us in that respect (plus his passing attributes are more utilised and he compliments Smalling the best).

1659~~~
He should had play Felleni position, he could done better job than him. 
The Idea of Blind as CB is good if we have CM who can defend better.

1660~~~
He should be in midfield if Schweinsteiger and Carrick are unavailable, unfortunately LVG sold the reliable back up centre back we had (Evans).

1661~~~
Can't blame him because his manager is asking him to be something which he clearly isn't. There are literally just few situations in the game in which he is actually doing any defending when the opposition team is attacking, and that's mostly because he is winning balls his teammates won because they stepped to cover him, rest of the time he is just chasing shadows, being out of position and expecting other players to cover him up. He is not a fecking defender, primarily because he isn't doing any proper defending.

I still can't understand how we haven't tried to pair him with someone like Carrick or Schneiderlin in midfield and he is here for year and a half already.

1662~~~
Evans was terrible last season, made complete sense to sell him. I'd say Blind's been much better this season, and even Jones/Rojo are better cover figures. I wouldn't be against moving Blind into midfield though. Would certainly provide a bit more than Fellaini at the moment.

1663~~~
Well okay if kompany is faster- what about the others?  TBH i think he looks particularly slow because he plays in front of Smallimg with Smalling almost being the last resort sweeper & blind being a deep lying playmaker of sorts. 

I dont really like jones & smalling together after seeing blind & smallings partnership.

1664~~~
Best player on the pitch today.

1665~~~
You think? I like him, but didn't think he was particularly great today. His corners were a bit rubbish, he criminally left one of the Liverpool attackers onside towards the end (which could have been costly), and was part of a defence which looked a bit all over the place at times in general.

1666~~~
I thought he was calm and composed today, gave us a level head back there, shame is corner delivery was off as Liverpool are poor at defending them.

1667~~~
He was the calming influence at the back as I thought Smalling was a bit over the place. Positional wise he was in the right place everytime it seemed.

1668~~~
No way.

Could have costed us in the 90th minute by brainless piece of defending leaving Firminho onside being around 10 meters behind our defence.

1669~~~
Intelligence, intelligence and intelligence. Not going full kamikaze Jones, just did what he could despite lacking pace but succeeded at the end.

1670~~~
Perhaps. He was definitely better than Smalling today, but his offside error towards the end was completely criminal.

1671~~~
To be honest I wasn't aware it was him keeping everyone on at the end. It was to nerve wrecking to concentrate at that point.

1672~~~
I love him. Considering this is his first season as out an out CB- i can only see him getting better. 

He was the only one today who could get rid of the ball from a problematic position &  still was able to find a player to pass to. 

Even if he isnt a firat twam CB according to some of our fans - his dexterity and ability to play multiple positions is the type of player that will one day make you win those tough CL games - like park ji sung & o'shea.

1673~~~
You mean like standing about 6 yards behind the rest of the team and playing Firmino onside for an easy chance? His positioning is average at best. His passing is great, but don't confuse that for intelligence in his role.

1674~~~
Thought he was ace today.

1675~~~
because he had just defended benteke and both of them were off balance for a couple of seconds and had to recover. Its not as if he was ball watching.

edit- it may not be benteke now that i think of it. It may have been ibe

1676~~~
Every team loves a Daley Blind

1677~~~
That's not the only time it's the case. Maybe Smalling can allow himself to play like that with Blind as a partner. The 'ol FM stopper-cover combo.

1678~~~
I must have watched a different match to some; earlier in the season the Smalling/Blind partnership looked pretty good, now Smalling is  having a bit of a dip in form, Blind makes me extremely nervous , gets caught out of position quite often at the moment and was a long way from being the best player on the pitch

1679~~~
Playing firmino onside was a shocker although I dont know what the defense was doing with a line quite that high in the circumstance - Blind was coming across and toward our goal to cut out a cross, still should've stepped by quicker.

The more he plays at centre back the more the issues with his strength and height seem exaggerated, he rarely gets shoved off the ball or beaten in the air, yes it happens but it does for every defender.

1680~~~
He's a midfielder, not a defender and surely not a permanent CB solution. If you can't see his intelligence or vision then you're the one confused.

1681~~~
That's only because he challenges for headers and phyical battles less than pretty much our any other player.

1682~~~
He's a quality footballer. As much as Smalling makes up for his lack of physicality, he makes up for the lack of technical quality in our entire back 4. Calm as feck.

1683~~~
His corners are shit.

1684~~~
What on earth was he doing in the first half? He was so far over the wrong side of the pitch that at times he was on the wrong side of Smalling!

Darmian kept having to come over into the centreback position because Blind had completely disappeared, and then two or three times Liverpool got in for a shot on goal as a result. It was so stupid I was actually annoyed at all of our players because it took about 30 minutes for someone to get hold of him and tell him to stop being such a fecking idiot. Why would you put up with your team mate trying to cost you the game for this long?

What people see in his performances to think he's anything other than a liability at centreback I just can't get my head around. His positioning in every game is just so bad. He's either standing in the wrong place looking like he's day dreaming, or just goes chasing shadows. He's going to pull this shite one day when we're struggling against someone good, and we'll get spanked by four or five as a result.

1685~~~
They were excellent when he first started taking them, but aye, very poor today.

1686~~~
I thought he had an interesting game. He defended quite well (except for one or two errors) and his passing was good and bad. The short, fast balls into midfield looked good, whereas the long ball to Rooney was often cut out by Toure. He was decent though.

1687~~~
He plays a lot like an old-fashioned sweeper in that sense. That shouldn't really be seen as a criticism given Smalling's shown he can handle being the stopper/man-marker against what tends to be just one striker.

1688~~~
Overall, he's done ok. We still need an excellent CB in the summer

1689~~~
Worst Performance of the season so far. He gave the ball away needlessly so many times, was in poor positions a lot and our worst player today for me. It's clear when Blind has an off game and when Carrick doesn't play, United will struggle to get the ball forward.

1690~~~
Imagine the reactions if Smalling's distribution was that bad. 14 long balls today, just 3 successful.

1691~~~
His passing was terrible but conversely won everything in the air today. It was the reserve Blind.

1692~~~
He started off with a couple of nice passes that cut through the lines, but he regressed as the game went on.

1693~~~
Exactly what I was thinking. His passing was awful.

1694~~~
His passing was so bad, it was kinda comical... defintiely one of those days for Blind.

I don't mind it from him so much... everyone has off days every so often, and his passing is usually the last thing you can criticise him for (i'll happily take him to task for his defending mind you) ... everyone else though has less of an excuse as to why our passing was completely dire.

1695~~~
His worst game for us, but tbf to him, he was at least showing for the ball and still trying even that late terrible free kick he was the only one to go to take it (though I really think DDG should have taken it and he should have been on the edge of the box).

1696~~~
He's been our worst player this season. I really can't figure out what people watch to come to any other conclusion than this.

There's this mythical idea that he's so good at passing it makes us better at playing out from the back, but when you actually pay attention to him, his passing is erratic at best and FAR too slow to be in any way effective. 90% of his passes are either ppointless or hospital balls. When peope have whined about our style of play this season, they basically describe what Blind does, but then at the same time praise Blind for doing it?

Him, Fellaini, Darmian and Lingard could go play for Sunderland and end up being the reason why they get relegated, rather than the reason why they don't. They all offer less to the team than any average mid table PL player would. Yet we put all four of them in expecting to still be able to play well.

1697~~~
We need to widen and lengthen the pitch for Blind. Blinds not the problem, the pitch is.....<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>Wasn't the only one but you have to have something inside you that rebels against that kind of thing. It's not good enough for a professional to say, it's just not my day. Especially when there's no major pressure on you, you can look in front of you and see people coming towards you. Needs to improve big time.

1698~~~
The sooner we buy a centre half and we no longer see him playing there the better. He's a fine holding midfield player but a defender he really is not.

1699~~~
Least of our problems.

1700~~~
We must be watching a different Daley Blind to you.

1701~~~
Really noodle?

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1703~~~
The sooner we buy a top CB to pair with Smalling the better, so we can give him some games at CDM.

1704~~~
How anyone can question his passing is beyond me.

1705~~~
He has the technical ability to pass well, but once every other game he seems to make an absolute brainfart pass straight to the opposition in our own half.

1706~~~
Passes well from defence.
But as a midfielder, he usually wants too much time on the ball to pass progressively.

Hope he's nowhere near the midfield as a starter in the future. Good solid squad player.

1707~~~
The problem with his bad passing is that he's actually trying to force things, which is mostly good because if he was to play it safe from his position, you would see a Carrick performance (not the good type).

He's a very good passer of the ball to feet but he's trying to thread a needle too much because the rest of the team are sh|t.

1708~~~
Hes trying to thread a needle because hes noone to pass too. There is Schneiderlin and thats it. Herrera is usually found too far forward, and Fellaini is usually just running around aimlessly. Blind is left with a pass to Schneiderlin who is almost always under pressure and cant do anything but pass it back, or sideways.

No coincidence people have started complaining about his passing since BFS and Carrick have been out. There is not enough linkup between defence and midfield.

1709~~~
He's done alright but a lot of those youtube vids are hype for me. Some people have forgotten what a great player looks like.

1710~~~
As <a class="username" data-user="91672, @11101" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/91672/">@11101</a> eluded to he's trying to force play with minimal options, when fellaini is in midfield he is never an out ball for the defenders, it's either square it yet again, try to find Schneiderlin on his own in midfield or try to force play himself by finding a difficult ball.

1711~~~
If that's the case, he's lacking in footballing intelligence and should just keep it simple.

1712~~~
Has been superb in this second half so far. And deserves that goal. Such an intelligent player and probably our most reliable too.

1713~~~
Aye distribution has been excellent, fantastic finish and his positioning for that Derby chance was superb.

1714~~~
I love him. He's our new Michael Carrick. Not in terms of position and style but as a player the fans take a few years to warm to and appreciate.

Our best passer of the ball and a clinical finisher!

1715~~~
Heartbreaking to see him playing in defense. He could do so much good during Bastian's absence.

1716~~~
He's got probably the best kicking technique in the squad, real asset.

Disagree, he doesn't have the discipline or awareness to play the holding role in midfield. And on top of that, we don't have anyone else to play at CB instead of him at the moment.

1717~~~
He's been awesome.

1718~~~
Hardly his fault that LvG didn't provide with enough options during the summer and the simple fact that he's not a nominal defender. At this point even Jones could do Fellaini's work at midfield.

Blind's would be a both better distributor and defensive midfielder plus he actually isn't afraid to shoot from distance which is almost non-existent thing these days.

1719~~~
Superb performance. Glad to see his form return. Second best player on the pitch

1720~~~
What a guy. Great performance. Love the guy.

1721~~~
I actually like him at CB considering this is his first season there.  The teams that play high pressure can't handle him.  However,  he does also make mistakes & todays goal against was partially his fault.. He has that LCB position until our main priorities are sorted IMO.

1722~~~
Even without the goal a fantastic performance.

1723~~~
Much much better in the second half... imposed himself on the game.

1724~~~
Bright future ahead if he can keep push on and develop. Still only 25 years of age and he is an example of a technical 'limited' player who possesses the intelligence to compensate that absence.

1725~~~
How is he technically limited? His ability on the ball is fantastic. The only part of his game that is limited are his physical attributes.

Thought he was superb tonight and I love having him at CB alongside Smalling.

1726~~~
Technically limited in the sense that he is not a flashy player with a dribbling technique. He is pure intelligence compensated with a briliant ball ability.

1727~~~
Fair enough, we clearly have different definitions of technical.

1728~~~
He was decent in the second half and took his goal well, even if I don't know what he was doing all the way up there. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> First half though he was weak and shared the blame for the goal with Schneiderlin and Fellaini, he has to do more in that duel.

1729~~~
He made some awesome interceptions and standing challenges. 

Great initiative for the goal too.

1730~~~
My MOTM tonight personally.

1731~~~
He's such a clever footballer. One of the best transfers we've made. Outstanding today.

1732~~~
Me too. Had two or three really impressive moments, top performance. I like him as a CB. I was so apprehensive about it at the start of the season but him and Smalling is definitely our best pair I think.

1733~~~
An absolute gem of a player, like several in our squad we're not sure of his best position or how to get the best out of him.

1734~~~
Could a midfield trio of  
Morgan-Blind
---Ander

work? 

That with a back 4 and a front 3 ahead of them?

I think I'd like to see that at some point.

1735~~~
He looked back to his very best yesterday, he's been quite poor recently but he played really well last night.

1736~~~
I think he should be moved back to midfield. I'd much rather him than Afro. He actually knows how to pass

1737~~~
Dont think that would work,Blind would leave so much gap behind after him rushing forward,back 4 would get almost none protection from him.

1738~~~
He's a far better CB than what we've seen with him in CM. His calmness on the ball and passing range is an absolute necessity for us with how we are playing. I wasn't sold with his all round game last year in midfield, plenty of poor performances. However i think he's found his role.

1739~~~
Had a great match yesterday - but keep in mind the opposition. Without a doubt a superb squad player and a strong signing, but I'm still not sure about his best position. 

While he's doing okay at CB, and obviously his passing is useful from deep, wouldn't people rather see a true, trained defender in such an important position? Smalling is having his best ever season for us, but I still don't think anyone would accuse him and Blind being a world-class pairing, which is something a club like United should aspire to. 

Would absolutely love to see him given another try in midfield instead of Fellaini. But injuries are preventing that for a good while longer.

1740~~~
I don't agree with this at all. He was a defensive midfielder for Ajax, he knows the position and he's a very intelligent player positionally. Having Schneiderlin in the team would also allow him to get a bit further forward and be a playmaker, which I'd like to see. I reckon it'd be quite a balanced midfield

1741~~~
Its a very misleading statement we come across a lot. Not trying to derail this thread, do notice very flashy individuals( Mata and Morgan) being praised for their great technique. To me its laughable considering how often you'll see their first touch forcing them back towards our goal.
Blind has brilliant technical abilities just falls short in the physical department and compensate for it with his intelligence. Technique can't be compensated with intelligence but physicality can be.

1742~~~
I think it could work, quite well. Blind's is an intelligent player, clearly reads the game very well which makes up for his lack of physical attributes, and is a brilliant passer of the ball. I'd rather have him as a DM/CM than a CB.

1743~~~
I think this is one of LVG's experiments that has definitely worked. We have one of the meanest defensive records in the league despite a cluster feck of injuries.

The Smalling - Blind partnership could work out for us like Pique - Mascherano for Barca if there was a bit more consistency in the rest of the team. Daley gives us a lot in terms of composure and distribution from the back. If he was flanked by decent full backs and the midfield in front of him didn't consist of Fellaini then I think he'd be getting a lot less exposed too.

There are other parts of our squad that need fixing way more than Daley as a CB does...

1744~~~
I disagree with the notion he's particularly intelligent. He constantly gets caught out of position. Yesterday's goal happened because he lost a header and then decided to stop running. He's an above average DM, an average LB, and a below average CB.

1745~~~
That was a mistake but that happened particularly because Smalling came out first & blind was left as the last man.  The moat common set up we revert to is Smallimg being the last sweeper/defender whilst blind does the rushing.

1746~~~
As the last man, he shouldn't have been rushing out like that. It showed a lack of intelligence.

1747~~~
First of all Blind won his header, and second he didn't rush out anywhere. Immediately after he won his header he dropped off to cover the player he just challenged for the header. The only one rushing out is Smalling who chased after the ball from Blind's header with 0 chance of winning it leaving a huge a gap in the defence and Schneiderlin failed to track Thorne.

1748~~~
To me anyway -  his mistake was the header & being beaten to it.  He is supposed to go after the attacker but it was smalling who went after it & blind tried to react & lost on the header. 

I love him at CB but a CDM/CB position - which i think is what schneirdlin does right now would be his long term position when we have improved the squad & that's including a new manager <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1749~~~
Correct. He actually showed his game intelligence when he was last man in the second half and stopped an almost certain goal.

1750~~~
Yeah that goal was all Smalling. I should be getting blame before Blind on that one.

1751~~~
Except that never actually happened because he won the header. Smalling is the one who rushed out, lost the header and then chased the loose ball he had no chance of getting to.

1752~~~
Yeh okay either way it's smallings mistake.  I really dont know what's happened recently with him?  Has LVG just yold them to play how they feel like?

1753~~~
I'd be happy to see us bring in a top CB and move him into CM. He's got a great passing range from deep and always looks to play forward.

1754~~~
No thanks. Being at centre back allows him to make more/better passes. His passing in't as good from midfield (and I don't put this down to the manager.)
He doesn't have quick feet, doesn't really have a one-touch/zippy two-touch game, often stations himself in positions where the ball can be rolled into his path...

It all results in him sitting extremely deep (so that the threat of being caught on the ball isn't there) and generally slowing things down. So while he might not give it away, it's still not on the level of the better players who also don't give it away but do significantly more with those accurate passes. 
The better midfielders could/can position themselves higher when the space is there to do so, and they could/can move with the ball into the available space and trust their ability to side-step/navigate round a challenge.

Blind was excellent vs Derby. His goal was the key moment of the game and he was fine defensively. He is doing a decent job at centre back but for me it just comes down to what the main role of a centre back is. There will obviously be differing opinions on this.

Is it starting the team's attacks or stopping the opposition from scoring? If the former, then he's the best at the club. If it's the latter he isn't good enough. Personally, I like defenders who are good at defending.

1756~~~
Thought he did really well today. He needs to stay in the first team IMO.

1757~~~
That pass for mata (i think) was just wonderful.

Maybe he can be our Carrick replacement

1758~~~
Yeh he started 2 of our 3 goals.  Passing like from the back is hard to handle.

1759~~~
Yeah was well impressed with him today, a good example of how he can be a very useful option at CB against teams we should be beating at OT.

1760~~~
Yep, gave him an 8. Started the move for Martial's goal and was positionally excellent throughout.

1761~~~
He's just fantastic.

1762~~~
Played the pass to Bojack and the pass to Mata for Rooneys. Such a tremendous player, the only one who will really force a pass forward alongside Carrick.

I've said before he gets far more focus and stick for tiny mistakes compared to Smallingbauer. 

Future captain, first name on the sheet in a variety of positions and a top class CB partnership with Smalling, imo.

1763~~~
Yet another great performance from him today. Such a tidy, smart player. 

His pass to Mata was sex.

1764~~~
Fantastic player.

1765~~~
When not under the pressure of one on ones you see his best game, very good tonight.

1766~~~
Playing constantly on not his nominal position but still being quite consistent.

1767~~~
He's a very good, stable & intelligent footballer, knows how to pick a pass, the pass to Mata for that third goal was lovely.

1768~~~
Don't worry lads, he's got this in the bag.

1769~~~
Looked fantastic tonight...  I am sorry Blind that I thought you were rubbish..  Just great allround performance..

1770~~~
He is just such an intelligent footballer.

1771~~~
Does Danny Blind have any other children we can bring in?

1772~~~
If we can find a proper fecking center back, he's the Carrick successor we are after.

1773~~~
I disagree. I don't like him in midfield as he gets overrun to easily. I wasn't a fan at all last season. He has been one of my players of the season for us at centre back and I think he should continue there.

1774~~~
When he is allowed the space he can be a decent addition in midfield. However as you stated, in times of pressure he lacks the physical attributes to control that area.

1775~~~
Could well be. He's a good, intelligent passer of the ball.

He didn't show the positional discipline for the role when played there last season (he preferred to press the ball) but he seems intelligent enough to grow into the role.

His pace is a bit of issue but Carrick was never that mobile either, yet still coped.

1776~~~
He played DM when we were experimenting with a forward line of van Persie, di maria, Falcao and Rooney in a diamond. Even prime Keane would have trouble handling that.

1777~~~
Pretty sure he was still getting overrun long after we realised Falcao was finished. When he was dropped from midfield out fortunes immediately improved and we went on that good run.

1778~~~
He could be our Xavi and Herrera our Iniesta <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1779~~~
We were shit at defending this time last year and didn't have Schneiderlin or Schweinsteiger as midfield options. December aside, we're much improved in this area.

Blind will succeed at CB or CM.

1780~~~
Hes a good partner for somebody like Smalling. They compliment each other well. Smalling doesnt have the passing he has, Blind doesnt have the coverage he has, but he looks like a leader which helps.

I think him moving out to DM long term will be a good thing however.

1781~~~
He was very good last night. Defensively very solid as well often against players like Walters and arnautovic. He never got dominated. He was as good as Smalling if not better

1782~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Good one.

1783~~~
No he's not. He's a better passer when playing in defence.
For a number of reasons, he's definitely not good enough as a midfielder.

1784~~~
I agree, coming out from the CB position into open grass allows him time on the ball to make his pass, I don't think he'd do that well in the hustle of midfield where he'd need to make his passes in a more crowded situation.

1785~~~
Exactly how I see it. 

Not just in terms of the speed at which his own passes need to be executed, but I also felt that when he played in Carrick's role, he preferred to position himself deep in order to receive slow passes to feet - whereas, ideally, he should be positioning himself higher up, and should have the technique, quick feet, and dribbling to deal with it under pressure at any height/speed. 

I don't feel he has that ability.

Like you say, at centre back he receives the ball almost always into feet, at a comfortable height and speed, and has space to play into without the fear of being pressed heavily or surrounded.

1786~~~
It's an unfair and early judgement based on his "first season" in a new league, in a different set up (mostly 4141, which offers far less help for the controlling midfielder than this 4231). I think if he had the same weaknesses exposed in his second season you could make that judgement, not when a new player, that has to acclamatide to a new much faster league, playing as the only controlling midfielder with Fellaini, Herrera, Mata and Young in front of him.

1787~~~
He was also a lot stronger than usual. Won back many balls where he would have lost the battle some time ago. Very good to see!

1788~~~
Based on our chase of Hummels and Ramos last summer, the plan must be for him to take Carrick's place in the squad after this season. 

We'll still need someone else in there - I've been very disappointed for Herrera, but it seems he's just not a LVG player. If that's the case, he should move on and we need someone else like Gundogan in.

1789~~~
What a post. Very sensible<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1790~~~
Based on what? Any time they get properly tested they usually crumble.

1791~~~
Agree with this, he's a capable CB but would like a more established CB to come in. Think he would be a good Carrick replacement and cover for CB/LB in the future.

1792~~~
We need a CB so we can play Blind in midfield when we are suffering with injuries there. His passing is wasted back there.

1793~~~
For the first goal ? That was Mata wasn't it ?

1794~~~
I love the guy, his passing isn't wasted in defence  because a ball playing defender is an important ingredient of a successful team I feel. Those long passes over the defence, or intelligent passes in between the lines as we saw in the third goal yesterday, are what he brings from this position. He is also a perfect counterpart to Smalling, I for one don't see the need for a new centre back, unless the new one is bought as a backup.

1795~~~
Even if Pep came here, I still think he would be playing CB

1796~~~
Who tested them and when did they crumble? They've been our most effective partnership since Vidic and Ferdinand lost their legs.

He's been comfortably better than Stones and Otamendi this season, two £30m+ defenders. Credit to Blind for stepping up a level.

1797~~~
Wolfsburg? Newcastle? Arsenal? The three most noticeable games this season when the opposing team has actually tried to attack us instead of sitting back and using the counter? (Though granted the Arsenal one can be put down to a crap tactics in general as well as other things).

1798~~~
With regards to him playing Carrick's role...

I think it's a little unfair to judge Blind as a midfielder when he plays there so little. When he has played there (more last season) it's usually been broken up by changing to left back or another position shortly after.

Carrick can look defensively/positionally wank plenty of times without a run of games so I do think it's harsh to rule out Blind's capable of playing that role without giving him 10-15 games in that slot.

Definitely one of our better footballers and you have to be a real scrooge to not appreciate him.

1799~~~
I'd actually say vs Arsenal and Newcastle, Smalling was the worst of the two.

1800~~~
He probably was actually. Both of them tend to look quite uncomfortable when they're actually tested, but I'd say that Blind can often look even weaker due to his lack of physicality. At the start of the season against Southampton, he struggled against pacey and physical players like Mane and Pelle respectively. It wasn't a game in which they dominated us, but when they did attack Blind looked very exposed.

1801~~~
After those 2 we are weak at CB tbh. I like Blind, but I would still improve on him if we could and Blind can fill in as a squad player.

1802~~~
Well I'm not specifically pointing fingers at either, just saying they've hardly looked like a top class CB partnership when teams have properly had a go at us.

1803~~~
Three matches where our midfield disappeared. Fellaini was used as a holding midfielder against Newcastle and Wolfsburg and contributed nothing to the game.

1804~~~
A bit underrated at times, I personally think he's been consistently good bar one or two games this season. Not an exceptional player yet but he potentially could be. Excellent passer of the ball, we can't deny that.

1805~~~
Just because your midfield disappear doesn't mean that your defenders can just do shoddy/nervy defending and get away with it.

1806~~~
He's cost us a lot of games/points this season due to his inability to defend on any basic level, and he has a habit of holding on to the ball for a fecking age for no real reason...often then loses afterwards. His positioning is also really really poor for someone who's "tactically intelligent"

He shouldn't be playing at centreback. That's the main problem really and there hasn't been a point this season where it's not looked pretty obvious. All well and good when we play Stoke and there's acres of room everywhere and no real threat. Not so good when we're away to Wolfsburg and within 20 minutes he's gifted them 4 clear chances that any competent centreback just wouldn't let happen. Or when we're at home to Southampton and Michael Carrick isn't there doing the job people pretend Blind does.

He did have a decent game last night but even so there's this weird urge on here to credit him with the work of other players. Carrick, Martial, Rooney etc. won us the game. Blind was fine but so was most of the team since we actually steamrolled an opponent for once. There's a bit of a Kagawa factor with Blind for some reason.

I wasn't convinced with him in mmidfield last season but I'd much prefer seeing him there than in defence. In fairness we haven't seen him given a real chance in midfield yet since when he played there last year it was in that ridiculous system where he was left all on his own, which any player would have struggled with. Also think he's looked ok at fullback. At centreback though, very definitely no.

1807~~~
Are you being serious? He has defended good more than often than not, to day that he cant even do the basic defending is just blatantly wrong.

1808~~~
He's had a good season so far. Maybe he needs some rest as well. He and Mike have played a lot this season.

1809~~~
What absolute nonsense.

1810~~~
Spot on.

He was good against Stoke, but that's not enough to make him a centre back of any standing. He's been our achilles heel in defence for much of the season.

1811~~~
Jeez.

Think he's been one of best performers this season. Assisted some crucial goals and not looked too shakey in defence.

If Jones had been having the season Blind has been having think everyone would have been singing his praise.

I like the look of blind at centre back, especially when our attack was lacking and edge he seemed to be trying to make things happen.

Just last week he popped up with an important goal from CB from open play. Fair fecks to him.

1812~~~
Way over the top nonsense, you really should catch a grip of yourself.

1813~~~
I think Noodle's post is a bit overly harsh on him, but his main point - that Blind is not a centre-back - is pretty much spot on. I'm find with Blind playing there in games which we expect to control and dominate. He's calm and composed on the ball. He's a good passer, which enables us to play it out from the back. He reads the game quite well. 

The problem is though that he's only really capable of doing all that when he's got the time and space to do so. He looks a lot less confident and reliable when he's put under any sort of pressure. His weakest games have come against opposition who have either created lots of chances, or who have had players who have been able to give him a hard time. Part of it's down to his lack of height/lack of physicality. Again, that's fine when he's not really being challenged, and I'm more than happy to use him at centre-back, but he's not a long-term option there. Someone who doesn't look at all comfortable when he faces a difficult game isn't someone who we can be relying upon in the long-term. Very useful and capable utility option though, in multiple areas of the pitch.

1814~~~
Nah its bollocks. Blind has been fine there this season, forming the best partnership we've had with Smalling since Ferdinand/Vidic and being the least culpable of the pair when it has gone wrong.

I think we should look to improve on him over the summer, but theres not many good centre-backs in the game at the minute, and I think we'll be hard pushed to find someone who's a significant improvement over Blind. For example, in hindsight I'm glad we went with Blind over Otamendi.

1815~~~
I think they're properly tested every game. In fairness our shape and insistence on 2 CDMs helps but they have conceded the second least amount of goals to Spurs and kept the most clean sheets this year. Also owing to DDG of course but whatever ailments we've suffered this year a poor CB pairing ain't one of them.

Broadly our defence has been great minus a few disasters that you mention however the Newcastle goals where in my opinion, a little freakish and the Arsenal demolition was more a showcase of what happens when you give top class talent lots of time and space and the CBs were really the last plug in an already sunken ship.

Back to Blind, Noodle is totally harsh and totally wrong. People will never, it seems, get over this not a natural CB, height, physicality thing.

Over the last 10 games he's won 46% of aerial duels, Smalling has won 56% in comparison and yet most would label him dominant in that area.

He undoubtedly reads the game well, has tremendous passing stats and often is key to our best attacking play/goals.

This myth that he is always one to be bullied or lacks some kind of natural CB quality is totally nonsense and driven entirely by perception rather than performance.

Also great hair.

1816~~~
If someone can explain to me why Smalling is having his best ever season and emerging as a 'world class' CB and Blind is a midfielder doing a job and a liability then I'm all ears.

They very much share the load and I'm confident I could point to as many instances of Smalling looking lost or being directly culpable for goals as Blind.

I won't though as I'm happy to say they are both doing a great job.

1817~~~
All this 'natural position' shite is a load of bollocks anyway.

1818~~~
He has mostly been fine - I like him, and he's filled his role well. They have been our best partnership since Ferdinand/Vidic, but that's hardly a massive achievement considering they're one of the <i>only </i>regular, recurring partnerships we've had since they departed. Again, Blind's had a decent season, but it's still clear at times (when he's under a lot of pressure), that he's not primarily a centre-back.

1819~~~
Like when Smalling gives away Penos or when Vidic literally got his ass handed to him by Torres on numerous occasions.

Every CB makes errors, looks foolish and is at fault on a semi regular basis, sometimes punished sometimes not. 

If Blind was a few inches taller and started as a CB people would think he was top class in that position, instead they micro analyse everything almost looking for instances to reinforce the moronic narrative that he's not a natural CB.

1820~~~
Totally.

1821~~~
Agreed.

Different systems make use of different skill sets in different areas of the pitch.

1822~~~
I'm not denying that Smalling has made mistakes. I think he's guilty of many of the crimes Blind's been guilty of: namely looking very panicked and not being composed when he's put under pressure.

References to Blind's height are presumably due to his lack of physicality, which <i>is </i>a problem for him at times. He's not particularly capable of matching up to much stronger forward, and has been bullied by a couple this season. I'm all for an intelligent, technically capable defender (which Blind is), but they've still got to be able to dominate and command a defence. Which I do think Smalling can do, although I'm not completely sure that Blind can. Again, useful option and he's had a good season, but he's not really an out and out centre-back, and he's probably not going to be our main man there long-term.

1823~~~
He had like 3 or 4 bad games at worst. In a season even vidic and Rio would have had couple of bad games. Nothing really. Otamendi stones and all has like 2 good games And lots of goals conceded due to their mistakes. Even a single mistake by him and people will scream 'he isn't a CB. He doesn't have height' and all. Smalling has had more mistakes than him inspite of playing all his life as mainly a CB (not counting the few RB games under SAF). He has at max 2 goals or so conceded due to his mistakes. Vs Bournemouth and Southampton away

In fact I can name maybe 3 or 4 centre backs In the PL who would be a significant improvement to him. Kompany (injury less), shawcross, koscielny, alderweireld and stones (not this season's version but). Players like mangala otamendi lovren mertasacker are worse than him in most aspects and they play for big clubs as well.

Just because he isn't tagged as a 'centreback' doesn't mean he is not good. He has been a defender all his career. It's hardly like we converted him from Winger to CB. If you think he isn't ok at CB, then Vidic would probably be just above average as per your standards

1824~~~
I think Blind is excellent at centre back. He rarely loses out because of his lack of pace in that position. It you are intelligent enough in that position then you don't need pace at all, see John Terry. So long as we don't start playing a high line I am happy for us not to sign a new first choice centre back.

1825~~~
The combination of Blind and Smalling works really well, I would not be in a hurry to beak that up except for a top top CB

1826~~~
The great thing about Daley is he would be first choice LB at the moment too (until Shaw returns) so even if you dislike him at CB everyone would still have him in the team.

Great signing, love the guy!

1827~~~
Best ball playing centre-back in the league.

1828~~~
That's pretty much spot on, there's a wealth of examples where he's been up against stong of fast centre forwards and have dealt with them excellently. As you say its micro analysed to a degree where any slight error will be emphasised to almost appease a negative preconception, 'see I told you he was poor in the air'.

1829~~~
Turning out to be a very good signing.

1830~~~
In the world I would say.

1831~~~
I find it strange when people say that he is only OK for games like Stoke, well that means pretty much 90% of the games we play. We have played over 30 games this season and you can count on one hand the number of times teams had a go at us.

1832~~~
The fact is that while I am still not sure if his future is at CB or not but in most United games I am waiting for him to get the ball because he seems to be our only attacking outlet.

1833~~~
Why stop there? I'm thinking in history.

1834~~~
LVG has in general, signed well, with only Di Maria being a definite flop. I'm sure that Darmian, Schneiderlin and Memphis will go on to become key players for us despite their struggles this term.

1835~~~
I find it odd that Smalling gets so much praise "best CB in the league so far etc" especially earlier in the season and Blind gets "hasn't been tested, teams haven't had a go"

I think the truth is somewhere in between. There have been games where he has been tested and come through, some he has been below par, and some where the defense has been entirely exposed and he actually handled the situation better than Smalling.

However in the majority of games he is rarely out of position and is very good defensively, and has handled the so called big strikers who will bully him because he is so weak.

I think he is having another good season, and in general going under the radar tbh. I would like an upgrade at CB for next season, however Blind has convinced me he call fill in at the position very well.

EDIT: At the price I will have to say LVGs best signing thus far

1836~~~
Jury is still out on those 3 but I'm also confident they'll prove to be good buys.

Di Maria never wanted to be here in all honestly so even though he's a flop, there's some sympathy for LvG there.

1837~~~

1838~~~
Which centre back is better at passing than Blind? He passes to the standard of a very good ball playing midfielder. He isn't top bracket for a midfielder like Xavi, Scholes or Pirlo but I can't think of another centre back with his level of ability at passing.

1839~~~
It's hard to tell whether all of your posts are complete WUMs or you are being genuinely serious.

Blind hasn't done a lot wrong this season and has been crucial for ball retention between the back four and the midfield. And has won us some games with some stellar forward passing.

And saying he's a complete liability in defense is also a bit absurd. We're second in goals allowed this season, and if we really did have someone in defense who was a complete liability, we certainly wouldn't be giving up so few goals.

1840~~~
In terms of passing, he's not in the bracket below, either (Alonso, Carrick, Busquets)
He's probably in the bracket below. He's definitely a better/more effective passer from the centre back position than from midfield.

1841~~~
Boateng, Pique, Javi Martinez, Thiago Silva. Possibly David Luiz and Sergio Ramos. 

His standard of passing isn't <i>that </i>good. He has an excellent raking diagonal pass when he isn't under pressure, but he's not some sort of ultimate libero at the back.

1842~~~
He's quickly becoming one of my favourite players. His composure and reading of the game have definitely contributed towards Smalling's form. Aside from his defensive qualities he also starts a lot of attacks and is our best outlet for long balls out of defence. He's a really consistent, solid player who has made a valuable contribution and he keeps improving.

1843~~~
Behave.

Only Javi Martinez can get in the conversation here. The rest are just very good *for defenders*.

Look at our two great team goals on Tuesday. Both started with Blind, one was a great pass to Mata in between the lines and the other was a beautiful little dink between two Stoke players under pressure. He also has two assists this season, one was a great mid range pass on the floor to Depay and another from a fairly long lofted ball.

1844~~~
He's probably the closest thing we have to a Carrick replacement in terms of his reading of the game. He still needs to improve a great deal, but he certainly has time to.

1845~~~
Aye, pretty much. He probably looks better than he is because the likes of Smalling and Jones are nowhere near as good as him when it comes to passing. He's a consistent, reliable passer of the ball, but someone like Carrick, for example, is better than him.

1846~~~
They're just names.  Non, bar Martinez, can pass the ball to the standard of Blind.

I just wish he had a touch more physical attributes, great football ability in a slightly non athletic skin.

People might hate me form it but he could be our Jan molby.

1847~~~
Have you seen Boateng in the Bundesliga? His raking through balls are easily as good as Blind's, I'm sure the Bayern viewers can attest to that. Likewise for Pique. It's not like Blind is infallible in his passing, he occasionally under hits short passes and puts them in silly positions.

1848~~~
I watch Bayern on a regular basis for a number of years. Boateng is nowhere near as good passer as Blind (especially in making the correct pass). Don't watch Barca enough to comment on Pique

1849~~~
Can Hummels still hit a pass?

1850~~~
Definitely one I forgot.

1851~~~
People massively under-rating Blind's passing ability here. Simply isolating him into the "good at diagonal passes when in space" group is shockingly harsh. 

The amount of times he's played a gorgeous pass to our forwards on the floor this season is fantastic. 

Let's not forget his gem of a pass to RVP in the WC too. Blind is in the top group of passing defenders.

1852~~~
Where is he in the group of defending defenders?

I like him, but he's 7/10 at too many things, and not 9/10 at playing any position.

1853~~~
Put one nicely over his own keeper in the last league game but the ref felt bad for him and gave him a free kick.

1854~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1855~~~
what's the latter, Martial or Lingard's goal?

1856~~~
Nope, people are rating his passing just about right, I'd say.

He <i>does</i> need space in order to be progressive/useful with his passing. Playing in defence allows him time and space to play into, and means that he can receive the ball slowly to feet without the pressure of being pressed, surrounded, or having his flat feet chomped at.

You say he's not all about long diagonal balls when in space, and then mention the 'gem' van Persie pass, which was pretty much just that.
I do agree that he <i>can</i> play a progressive pass, and can pass into feet... but he has to play in defence to do it, for the reasons mentioned above.

To even compare him as a passer to Carrick or Alonso (who can do it higher up the pitch, under pressure, and often with two/three swift touches) is indeed overrating his passing ability.

1857~~~
Quality midfielders have always been underrated at OT. We've seen United buying JSV despite having the best attacking midfielder in his generation and people sneering at the idea of Keane replacing Ince and Carrick replacing Keane. Not to forget the fact that Pogba couldn't get games in a midfield filled with near 40 year olds and the likes of Cleverley, Ando etc.

I think we've got a good thing going in CM. They are not world class but they do have a mix of skills which combined and used wisely can build an excellent CM. Schneiderlin is the typical DM we lacked for years. He may not be the best passer of the ball but he's not shit in it either. Blind is an intelligent player with decent movement, good passing skills and a good shot while Ander has great movement, he's creative and he's hardworking. Not to forget Bastian whose experience will allow us time to make sure this CM gel together. 

United CM had seen better days of course but it had seen much worse days too. I think it would serve us well in the future if we use it wisely. Meanwhile money should be spent in other areas especially on the flanks and in the defense

1858~~~
But it really isn't, Carrick has played centreback plenty of times, how many times did he play a killer pass from there? Blind takes a little longer on the ball because he's waiting for the movement to make a positive pass, if it doesn't come he plays a simple one. It's crazy how dismissive people are of his passing ability.

1859~~~
I rewatched the highlights last night. It was actually Carrick that made the beautiful dinked pass out of defence for Martial's goal. Blind did start the move with an intelligent tackle in the box. Blind's pass to Mata between the lines was for Rooney's goal.

1860~~~
Exactly. Ramos, Silva are all obviously superior defenders but to say they're better passers is absolutely ludicrous.

1861~~~
pretty sure Carrick delivered those passes from the defense plenty of times last season, both of them have that ability

1862~~~
Did he? I can't remember putting strikers through as regularly as Blind has done.

1863~~~
blind is a natural defender. Carrick is a CM. That's a big Difference

1864~~~
Im sure van gaal likes for the team to defend with 5 at the back.  Blind would be fantastic if he is able to dictate when to drop in to defence & when to step forward to midfield. 

Him dropping back to CB from CDM would allow him to start are attacks off as he occasionally does now.  

Saying that,  we have much bigger problems than focusing on that currently & he himself needs to come to terms with the CB role a bit more him self. 

Attack= 433
Defence=541
Intermediate= 352

I think a large part of our troubles have been because of trying to find a stationary formation to work from.  The above 3 have had there benefits & negatives.  Let's see if the 4321 works better.

1865~~~
Have any of you actuallly paid attention to his defending in games?

His positioning is poor...he drops back when the rest of the defence push up. He goes for balls he has no chance of getting. He often gets caught 30 yards too hig up the pitch for some unknown reason and then ends up being muscled to the ground. It happens in pretty much every game he plays. At Anfield the other week he kept cropping up the wrong side of Smallling and then getting the ball played past him, then when I looked on here Darmian was getting blamed for this because  he was the one who had to try and cover two Liverpool players by himself as a result.

He loses his man too often, when people run at him he looks vulnerable and is often bailed out by Smalling or a covering fullback. 

We have to play Fellaini in large part due to Blind's lack of physicality which is a problem at set pieces...and people can sneer at that all they want but height and physicality ARE a large part of being a centreback...unless you're Barcelona and just aren't going to let the opposition out of their own half...which we kind of try to do, badly.

He's a burden on our other defenders too often. Try watching the Bournemouth game again when he ended up next to McNair and so had to take responsibillity for defending upon himself...it did not end well, at all. 

But hey ho he can play a good pass once every other game so lets just ignore literally everything else that happens. When you're arguing that someone is good at centreback because they're good at attacking, maybe have a think aboout how much sense that makes...especially when it's in relation to a team that have been god awful at attacking all season.

THe problem with this forum is that people decide whether they like a player or idea very early on and then base their opinion entirely around that iniitial assumption, rather than paying any attention at all to what the player or idea actually does to help the team during a game...and then when some kind of differing opinion comes along it's "what absolute nonsense", "you WUM", "utter bollocks" etc...just empty denials. Then six months or so later after it's gradually become more and more difficult to ignore the faults, everyone starts changing their tune.

I don't mean to call you all idiots but redcafe is quite possibly the worst place in the universe to get an accurate opinion on the performance of any footballer, so I just can't take the nonsense comments seriously. This is the forum that took a whole year longer than the rest of the world to accept that David Luiz maybe wasn't the best defender in history. As recently as earlier this season I was getting the "utter nonsense" comments on here for suggesting hoofing the ball to Fellaini to try and score goals was a bad idea. 

I kind of agree with this. We can get away with playing him there in games where whether he's good at being a centreback isn't that important, as he does have enoough abillity to assist us in possession. Whenever it does become important to defend though (i.e. when the opposition are able to attack us), it becomes a pretty big problem.

I remember the Wolfsburg game specifically because I missed it at the time, came on here and read loads of comments praising Blind, and thought "that's odd, we lost 3-2...all our other defenders must have had shockers then"...then I watched the game and, without any exaggeration, Wolfsburg had been clean in on goal 4 times within 20 minutes as a direct result of Blind's errors or unsuitability. You just read stuff on here sometimes, and think "what the feck are you people on?" it's so baffling. We had no chance of winning because of this, in what was at the tiime our most important game of the season. Which makes it a pretty big fecking problem, really.

Now we've had to resort to playing Fellaini in midfield to, in part at least, compensate for a lack of physicality and height from set pieces, which again is quite a big problem when you consider that it also means having Fellaini in the team, doing passing and stuff. 

None of this is a viable solution for a team that reckons it wants to win trophies and finish at the top of the league and stuff. It's a make do/stop gap solution and I dont even think a particularly good one. Just a forced one due to injuries and poor squad management. 

Unfortunately coming on a forum and stating things like "best ball playing centreback in the league" can't force this to either be true or an actual thing. 

What? How?

Also we didn't go with Blind over Otamendi. We went with no one over Otamendi. Either that or tried to get him and failed. Though agree he hasn't looked great so far either.

1866~~~
See, the Vidic/Torres thing all came from that one game where Vidic slipped over and then got sent off for being an idiot (something he did on occasion regardless of the opposition striker). Somehow this translated to Torres "always giving hm a torrid time"...when these numerous occasions were on which this happened I'm not sure. There was one other game where Torres was a difference maker against us and that was at Anfield when he skinned Ferdinand to score...not Vidic. 

The problem with saying "if Blind was a few inches taller" is that he isn't. It's like saying "if we'd won a few more games we'd be top of the league"...it's just fiction. 

You also start your sentence by basically admitting Blind isn't a natural centreback due to his height, then end it by claiming this is a "moronic narrative"...So are you saying that he's doing well for someone who isn't a natural centreback or claiming that the whole idea he isn't one is moronic? make up your mind

1867~~~
In the games we have defended badly - Wolfsburg, Newcastle, Arsenal - Smalling was definitely the worst centre back in each of them.

1868~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>

Blind goes up for the ball because smalling works best as the last line of defence.  In the last couple of games- our goals against have been predominantly caused by Smalling going for balls that he has no chance of getting - in return leaving blind as the last line of defence which is nowhere near as poignant as it is the other way around. 

Blind almost plays in front of smalling because he reads the game well & he can also pass the ball from deep predominantly in to forward positions. 

Again,  when we have the majority of the ball the need for a Rio/vidic type defence is not needed half as much.

1869~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> agenda-driven posting has reached a new level, but that doesn't surprise me at all.

Making the blasphemy in this forum, I think that Blind is actually a better CB than Smalling, or at the very worst case, he has been better than Smalling for the majority of this season. Of course, he isn't English, isn't 7 foot tall and doesn't put the ball in Row Z everytime a player is 50 yards near him, so he isn't good in the eyes of many.

1870~~~
People want us to become Barcelona, so care more about having technical players in defence rather than actual defenders. Blind is a below average defender. Noodle is spot on.

1871~~~
Yup, far too many hipsters in our fanbase now.

1872~~~
Just as many of our supporters who want us to be chelsea <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1873~~~
Hopefully Mourinho's arrival will purge at least one set of them - and Blind from our starting CB position.

1874~~~
Get some mikels,  ramires on the way.  Some wingers who cant attack ( do we need any more of them),  half of the belgium squad & a striker who cheats & spits.  We can look forward to 14th after a maximum of one or 2 trophies.  

Special one for sure. 

Love it.

1875~~~
You clearly don't know what you're talking about if that's what you believe.

1876~~~
Even Baresi wouldn't make for himself English fans. Too short, passes instead of panic, etc etc.

Not that I am comparing Blind to Baresi, or anything like that. Just that I think that a lot of people criticize Blind here for not being the stereotype English CB.

Btw, I thought that I am crazy for rating Blind higher than Smalling, and apparently they have identical rating in squawka. It doesn't mean much of course, but I guess it agrees with me that they are in quite similar level. I prefer Blind because of his style, but really, I think that neither of them is a very top defender, while both of them are quite good. Eventually, I think that Smalling would become a better defender, and by eventually, I mean soon enough.

For what is worth, I think that up to November, Smalling carried Blind, but since then, Blind has outperformed him.

1877~~~
This here is so very true, and something of a common mindset among people, especially on the caf in players threads, they just repeat common misconceptions about a player non stop, sometimes it makes me wonder, surely if they are fans, they must be watching the players surely. Its like no one is capable of forming their own opinions nowadays, just go with the common consensus regardless of the truth in the origin of the statements

1878~~~
People often talk about Smalling being as poor as Blind, but I'm not sure how that's relevant to Blind's performance. For what it's worth, I actually <i>do </i>think Smalling's been quite disappointing since around November/December, but his poor moments often seem to be individual moments where he'll have a brainfart, make a poor clearance/pass, grab onto someone's shirt, or whatever. For the most part, he's positionally quite sound, is strong, and can play well defensively.

Blind just looks quite uncomfortable in general when he's not having a good game, and can have entire games where he's dominated by opposition players. Where Smalling makes some errors, and has some poor games, Blind can sometimes just look out of place in his position, positionally, physically etc.

1879~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>

Nonsense. Blind is not the reason why Fellaini is in the middle. From 21 conceded premier league goals, we have only conceded 5 from corners or free kicks delivered into the box. 

In contrast, Blind has to step up so often, because midfield has gone missing. It's basic level defending, anyone who has ever played in a half decent football team should know this.

If a player looks as if he is about to receive a ball around the 30 yard mark (the "hole") without being challenged, one of the two defenders must step up. If one of them didn't step up, a striker would turn to find two back peddling defenders and 10 yards of space to run into. It's not a case of Blind winning the ball, the purpose is to step up and stall the player whilst midfield and fullbacks tighten the gaps.

It happens on a regular basis as it is an obviously practiced routine.

Blind has is physical vulnerabilities, no one can deny that, but some of the claims on here are absurd, especially when the stats are proving he is a extremely capable defender.

1880~~~
Are you making up stuff? We played with Schneiderlin schweini and Carrick for most of the games til October and played Fellaini only due to injuries. We also never 'hoof it to fellaini'. If hoofing means keeper kicking the ball and him winning it at halfline (which again doesn't happen that often) then I donno what pulis and Klopp (with caulker) do.

You seem to have these cliched opinions. If Fellaini plays 'we good it to him' irrespective of the reality. If blind has a bad game then 'he is the worst player of the season' and 'his height and pace limitations have cost us lots of points'. Try actually watching matches for a change maybe?

You seem to have decided he is shit at the beginningand remain in denial irrespective of his performances

Edit - Bournemouth game? We had McNair CBJ and varela in the back 4. He had a mistake in the game but with that back 4?

1881~~~
Fellaini is starting because Schweinsteiger and Carrick have both been out. I said it in the Ander thread, Blind has 33 starts and Fellaini only has 15. Such correlation. I wonder why we didn't need to start Fellaini because of Blind in those other 18 matches.

1882~~~
That's just nuts if you believe that.

1883~~~

some of the defensive work he does in these videos are exemplary. Yet there are people who claim that all he does is pass and that him at CB has ended up with him being bailed out by Mike most of the time. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1884~~~
Not sure what the hell he was thinking for their goal. Did he think Terry was a threat 22 yards out with his back to goal in a tight space? If we're going to challenge for things next season he can't be our CB. You need either pace or strength and a strong positional awareness.

1885~~~
not a CB never will be under new manager.

1886~~~
I thought our back line played to a decent standard, but I think the main culpability falls to him for their goal.

1887~~~
He makes a couple of errors every game. Not a CH and its costing us.

1888~~~
Constant pressure from opposition with 93% possession and eventually any centre back pairing will let you in.

Point the finger all you like - it's symptomatic of Van Gaals crap management and preparation for various scenarios in a game.

1889~~~
Some of his positional play today was quality and I thought he did well against Costa. If you pick apart the goal we conceded there are several culprits.

1890~~~
I think that's what it boils down to, he simply isn't a CB.

1891~~~
For two players who have been playing together all season, him and Smalling really don't seem to be on the same wave length a lot of the time.

1892~~~
Loublaze will tell you otherwise. Vehemently so.

1893~~~
Where was he even going for the goal? I mean, CBJ obviously shouldn't be playing everyone onside... but feck if I know what Blind is trying to do.

1894~~~
He's been really good for us, but that slip was costly.

1895~~~
Maybe but I just don't see it. He's a good player but a bit of a liability at CH when up against the best teams.

1896~~~
Think he played well in general, but definitely a big mistake for the goal.

1897~~~
I agree with you. I'd take Dier or Stones.

1898~~~
Just saying this is his first season at CB.  Why can he not improve in your eyes?

1899~~~
Thought he was superb today until the slip.

1900~~~
He does that kind of stuff quite often but people ignore it for some reason and call it great defending. Weird.

1901~~~
Isn't a centre back and never will be, makes far too many costly mistakes but nobodys arsed cause he plays a nice pass. Jones being a waste of time is part of the problem but not buying an actual centre back when we clearly needed one last summer is all on Van Gaal. If your going to be so slow then you'd expect them to have the physicality to make up for it and he has neither. Not his fault at all but should be playing at LB or CDM.

1902~~~
I actually think he's been playing a lot better at centreback for the last month or so, to the extent that if he can keep it up I don't think getting a new centreback to partner Smalling is an absolute top priority. Don't get me wrong, I'd hope we still would. But it would drop behind a couple of other things in terms of priority.

Not sure what was happening for the goal though. I really need to watch a replay of it and see just where everybody is.

1903~~~
felt he and Smalling were both really good but they do lack the presence of a Terry/Vidic/Ferdinand

a super passer and a very intelligent player

1904~~~
Got a text by a Chelsea mate at 80 mins saying Blind is still to have a moment! Fecking unbelievable he's not a defender that's for sure but he's a decent player. But hope we buy someone better in the summer to play alongside Smalling. Blind our number 3 centre half Jones 4th choice and Rojo on your bike son.

1905~~~
If Mourinho becomes manager there's very little chance he will continue at CB. Still, Blind is ace and we picked him up for a bargain fee.

1906~~~
He always does that. Even when he's playing in midfield. It's fecking annoying and downright stupid.

1907~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

I think you misspelled 'intelligent'

1908~~~
Oh Yeah. The tactically intelligent super Daley Blind<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1909~~~
It was annoying they analysed it to death on Sky. He clearly follows Terry out, not realising Costa was behind him.

1910~~~
Watch the end of the game today did we lads? Or are we just sweeping that one under the carpet or going to pretend he wasn't at fault for the goal? Because otherwise, that point I (and as it turns out quite a few others) made about him costing us games due to not knowing how to play at centreback, well...

You also might notice his complete piece of non defending when Fabregas got in and De Gea bailed us out. He literally just stood there and watched it happen even though he was the one who came over to pick Fabregas up. These just aren't isloated incidents at all and that's the problem. When he has to actually defend, he has no idea how to, and it costs us.


Sorry but I have to single this one out.  Accuse other people of being agenda driven then immediately reveal yourself to have a massive insane agenda about bias towards English players <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wolfsburg? seriously? I mean, the Newcastle game was mad and against Arsenal we were poor defensively as a unit, so I at least wouldn't single him out as being THE problem in those games, but the Wolfsburg game he was an absolute mess <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You have to watch it back and actually pay attention to him if you think otherwise. It's the worst game he's had for us by quite a way. Wolfburg saw the weakness and were quite impressively ruthless about it. Though there were people on here praising him afterwards which figures.

No I'm going on the basis that Fellaini is very clearly quite useful at defending in the air and from set pieces, while Blind is not (and a centreback is expected to be strong in that department). So it is logical to assume that Fellaini's recent run in the team at the very least has something to do with this. I mean, if someone said to Van Gaal "is part of the reason Fellaini is a usefull player to have in the side his strength in the air at set pieces" and Van Gaal said "no", Van Gaal would either be lying or an idiot, wouldnt he?

I don't get what our line up in October has to do with it. I'm talking about the team that is being picked at the moment, not about 30 games ago. When Schweinsteiger is fit again maybe he will replace Felllaini as LVG willl see him as more beneficial. At the moment thoough he sees Fellaini as more beneficial to the team than more accomplished/natural midfielders like Schneiderlin and Herrera. If you have a better theory on why this might be then please tell.

We very definitely did hoof it to Fellaini. We haven't done so more recently from memory but denying this is something we were doing at one point is strange to say the least, coming from someone accusing others of not watching the games. It was causing absolute uproar by the time it stopped happening!

You've also made up a bunch of barely comprehensible stuff literally no one has ever said and then accused me of saying it in order to accuse me of having false opinions. Why bother? What does this prove to anyone?

It's just weird isn't it? A lot of the time I read stuff on here and think "surely you don't watch football and think that?" and the common theme is it'll always be some bandwagon opinion that started as a lazy cliche and somehow ended up being considered fact...then it ends up, for some reason, ruling over other factors like using your eyes to actually watch the game. It's what pundits do except you can expect it from them as they wont sit there watching every game for every team, so they have to assume to a degree. With fans on here it's baffling because they are watching the games then somehow ending up with an opinion on the game that was clearly formed before the game happened. The best part is how aggressive people are with it. If you talk to people in real life or go to games and stuff this just doesn't exist...it's some kind of internet disease.

1911~~~
Of course he knew Costa was there, he was standing next to him literally 5 seconds before, he doesn't just disappear. 

Blind thought the ball was going into Terry and he tried to pro act and cut the ball out. Unfortunately he misjudged it and when he tried to stop and run back he slipped. Really he should have just held his position and defended it when it came into the feet, but that's what happens when you play a pressing midfielder in CB.

Overall he actually does a really good job as a CB, considering many thought he is slow and weak, he's better than 3/4 of the CBs in this league. He could probably go to Barcelona and be a star in La Liga.

1912~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1913~~~
The main culprit of our goal. No idea what he was doing. I thought he was shaky late this game.

1914~~~
Didn't our last goal(against Derby?) also come with him* pushing high and leaving acres of space behind, not even realising there is a player behind him, which not only intelligent, but even players like Rojo wouldn't do? 
I seriously don't understand why people praise his intelligence all the time when he really isn't showing that he is that intelligent when he is playing as a CB.

*Both Smalling and Schnaiderlin were bigger culprits for that goal though, but still Blind's defending was terrible, him acting like this happens really quite often.

1915~~~
Sure you laugh, but in a league where Physicality isn't over used and technical ability is more important it suits his game to a tee. You can't say he doesn't tackle and positon himself really well, the only time he's ever really found out is in a quick foot race or a striker backing into him.

1916~~~
How can you blame that one on Blind. He was marking two players (why was he marking two players anyway) and at the time made the correct choice - Terry stepped out to receive the ball in space, Blind knew Costa was offside (or should have been if CBJ held a line) so he made the correct choice to close the free player. 

It's easy for you to sit in your armchair with hindsight and blame Blind, but unlike us at home, he hasn't got an Birdseye view to see a poorly positioned CBJ. 

Mata is the most accountable for not making a challenge in the dying ends of the game, he allowed the player to take several touches to control, sidestep and produce a simple pass. He never even wanted the ball, complete disgrace.

1917~~~
He's certainly confounded expectations as CB overall. The goal was a collective failure, obviously. A galling one at that.

1918~~~
Agree with him knowing Costa was there. All I can say to this, both him and Smalling have been doing this same thing all season. Stepping out into play when the partner is not there to cover the space left behind.
Btw United have conceded quite a few chances because of this same dumb thing from the CBs. I know they do it thinking the CDMs will cover it but the gamble today was costly because the CDMs were already on the back foot.
It was a brainfart. Has happened to the best defenders out there.. I wonder how many times we'll have to cut Smalling loose too or declare him not good enough.

1919~~~
So in theory, if Blind failed to step out, Terry received the easy pass , to either shoot at goal or slide a runner in, would Blind still be at fault?

It was a no win scenario for him.

1920~~~
If Terry gets the ball, then Blind steps out to him... he shouldn't try to read what's going to happen before it happens. He should mark his man.

1921~~~
Blaming the goal just on him is harsh. He was left 2v1 with no midfielder in front of him and Smalling dragged out wide.

1922~~~
Just seen this... what?! He faces him up and doesn't dive in like a lunatic...  exactly what he should be doing. Carrick does the same thing on Hazard literally seconds before.

1923~~~
I think he was excellent, and has been all season. Arguably the most intelligent player we have, along with Carrick and Bastian.

1924~~~
Are you like serious? He pushed up so that Costa and Ivanovic, in case a pass was made to them, would be offside. CBJ didn't push up in time (inexperience. Will come better later). He also went to cover a pass to terry and if another runner comes Smalling can take care. If rojo and all don't do it, then I'd be more worried because that's what you have to do. He didn't even need intelligence here. Just common sense. 

They kind of should.

1925~~~
What in the utter feck was he doing for that goal?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1926~~~
You know what I mean... he shouldn't storm out of position just because he thinks the ball might go there.

1927~~~
The goal is all on Blind, no question.

But you have to love the job Blind has done at CB the entire season.  The man is simply not a CB yet he's held the fort down well.  Not perfectly, of course, but he's punched well above his weight.

Still, we need to go in for a CB in the summer.  I have no confidence in Jones.  Rojo is a solid squad man for me but not regular starting grade.  Let McNair develop on his own schedule, but he definitely can't be counted on yet as a starter.

1928~~~

1929~~~
I have a feeling Rojo is going to be Mourinho's darling. He has all the raw tools to be a great CB, he just hasn't had a run here. 

One thing you can't argue with is that Jose is great on the defensive side of the game, and I'm sure he can build a solid player out of Rojo. Him and Smalling is an ideal partnership - pace, power, aerial ability, left foot/right foot combination.

1930~~~
People will use his slip today to say he's an awful player, not United quality, blah blah blah.

He was great today again, moments like the slip for their goal will happen. If anything CBJ is the one to blame for holding the offside line too deep.

1931~~~
Still something left to be desired at the back, but so classy on the ball. I'd be surprised if Barcelona arent all over him in the summer

1932~~~
He was lucky with the penalty decision too.

Plenty of those are given, and hand wasnt in a natural position.

I dont like him as a starting CB for us, but he's too smart too be benched.

1933~~~
He wasn't too bad for most of the match. A few errors here and there though.

1934~~~
You can say goal is his mistake,
but when you give 93% position to opposite team and your CM are useless you know this thing can happen.

1935~~~
He sprinted to press feckin John Terry and left his central position, that was stupid and bad defending. Why on earth he comes out to press Terry who has his back to goal so far in front of box when he has Costa behind him?

1936~~~
It's obvious that they tried to play them (Ivanovic and Costa) off. Two weeks ago terry scored a late equaliser because people took him lightly. Nothing stupid in covering terry at the same time playing Costa off. Now if CBJ didn't go forward in time and played him on is not his mistake.

1937~~~
Yeah, he was sprinting to press Terry. If he was playing them offside he would have just stepped forward.

1938~~~
Daley Blind's view on the goal: "it was a shit moment from me"

Even when Blind personally admits, on national television, that he made a silly mistake, people on here will STILL pretend something completely different happened.

a) Why on earth would we be deliberately playing an offside trap when we were practically sat on our own goal line? This is NEVER something any team would do
b) Why on earth is it ever the "correct thing to do" for a centreback to ignore the opposition striker in order to run off after someone else who's running AWAY from goal, and then fall over?

Why do people invent the completely absurd just to avoid admitting what they saw with their own eyes? 

He made a very clear mistake, then came out afterwards and admitted, to alll of you, that  he made a mistake. You're like babies refusing to accept being spoon fed sometimes.

1939~~~
I still maintain he defends like a defensive midfielder playing in defense. Far too much ball chasing and moving to anticipate whats going to happen, instead of anticipating whats going to happen <b><i>then</i></b> moving.

1940~~~
More like a box to box midfielder. He doesn't have the discipline or positional sense of a true DM - such as Mascherano, Busquets, Alonso etc. He's a similar player to Sami Khedira in many ways.

1941~~~
Yeah thats fair... he would often go walk abouts when he was in DM last season.

1942~~~
They won't be.

1943~~~
Based on the BBC interview linked above: Blind inferred that the slip was the mistake not his attempt to win the ball (which he seems to believe he would have done that had he not slipped). "I think that if I am not slipping I have the ball".

I myself think it was an error of judgement to rush out but what he said still leaves plenty of scope for debate on both sides.

1944~~~
Dont know why people think mourinho (or any couch for that matter) will immediately drop him.
Carvalho wasn't exactly a monster.

Meh, one of the few positions in our team i'm happy about (cover would be nice though).

1945~~~
So you prefer and reactive rather than a proactive defender. Why don't we just stick Jones at the back then?

If Blind steps out once the ball goes to Terry, he is in no mans land, Terry would easily have flicked the ball onto Costa. If he doesn't step out, Terry shoots. The point is, Blind should not be making two men on the edge of our box.

Not sure why there's any need for that?

He admitted that he slipped. He said if he didn't slip, he wins the ball, which is exactly right.

A) I have played football at higher level than most people and I can 100% tell you that teams do play the offside trap there. We were most definitely playing for the offside, hence the almost perfect line of defense on the 18 yard box.

B) because Costa 'should' have been offside. Blind reacted to the only threat at the time. CBJ threw the spanner in the works with poor positioning.

You clearly have an agenda. There's a list of errors before the ball got near Blind, with ruoghly 6 oother people who are responsible for the goal - Memphis poor pass, Schniederlin pushing too far too late in the game, Darmian's poor positioning forced Smalling to be pulled wide, Mata clearly didn't want the ball, and CBJ was sitting 4 yards behind his defensive line - yet you come here to place all the blame on Blind, because he doesn't fit the idea of what you think a Center back should be.

Carrick positioned himself to block the available forward passes. In that position you want your midfielder to usher the ball backwards or wide. Mata did neither, he stood and allowed Chelsea to make the exact pass which he should have been preventing.



I'd like to point out - in the event of me sounding like a Daley Blind groupy - that although i'm impressed with his season so far, I agree that Blind is a niche defender and most likely not the long term solution. I would actually prefer to see Rojo given more gametime alongside Smalling, I've stated this on numerous occasions.

1946~~~
No, I want a defender who does what defenders should do.

You won't see any defender anywhere that plays the game by guessing what's going to happen... because no defender should claim to be a mind reader. Sure, Defenders will anticipate whats going to happen and then make moves to stop it... but they won't leave their man and go mark another one just because they think the ball is going to go there... that would be completely ridiculous.

Blind should not be left with two men no, but in the case that you are, you mark the man who is the bigger threat in the situation... you certainly don't abandon him and run to someone else just because you think they might be getting the ball.

And he's not stepping up to play offside (if he was he'd do just that - step out - instead he actively sprints out of his defensive line) so you can't really blame CBJ that much. He is perfectly in line with Blind, and he can - in no way - guess that Blind is just going to randomly leg it out to John Terry. If anything, CBJ should have pulled Martial in to mark Ivanovic and he should have gone out to Terry.

Mata does the same thing, Fabregas just uses the outside of his boot to play it around him... honestly, you're being weirdly hyper critical there, of a player who isn't reknowned for his defensive capabilities in teh first place. At least he was back in the right position and behind the ball, which is more then can be said some players.

1947~~~
It was an idiotic gamble to take on the edge of our own box. Totally unnecessary but something he is prone to doing

1948~~~
That's exactly the definition of a great defender. 

Costa wasn't his man, because Costa 'should' have been in on offside position. CBJ was already behind Blind, Blind was inline with the rest of the defense. Blind didn't step out to play offside, the whole defense (except CBJ) had already held a line and left Costa in an offside position at this point. With this considered, Terry was the 'bigger threat in the situation'.

If Blind marks Costa as you wanted him to, that means he has to take a step back and get goalside. Which leaves Terry in a seven yard bubble of space. If Blind remains stationary, Terry receives the ball and Costa has spun away, leaving Blind between the two like an amateur.  

So because Fabregas uses the outside of his boot, Mata gets an excuse, oh and because it isn't Mata's job to defend he can do a simple task halfheartedly. Yes, I was hypercritical in saying Mata is the most accountable (I would now say that it would Schnierdlin for leaving his duties) but it doesn't make up for the fact that in this passage of play, Mata was about as useful as a Subbuteo figure.

1949~~~
Massively incorrect

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/v3a7" width="560"></iframe>

And a great defender reads the play and does his defending at the right moments. He doesn't just randomly go to where he think the balls going to be before a player makes a pass....

1950~~~
Ok point taken, it wasn't as far as I remembered.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E4vr49eUgU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Here's a side view.

0.03 Martial and Blind both step up to try and meet the line. CBJ is looking the wrong way and about 1 - 2 feet behind the line.
0.04 Fab makes the pass and Blind then steps out.

I concede that it wasn't the "4 yards" I was claiming, but my point still stands - there are 3 players marking Willian, CBJ is looking the wrong way and playing Costa onside and Mata allows Fabregas the forward pass.

...but it was all Blind's fault.

1951~~~
Your analysis is spot on. Mata was goal side, but he never was in position to be between the ball and goal, cutting off a forward pass. Blind could afford to step into the passing lane because he had played Costa offside/being in the proper position, obviously not knowing CBJ played Costa onside. Martial was quick to push up/move his line forward when the ball was recycled before Cesc had the ball. Every United player on the 18 yard line was moving up as Cesc had the ball, the only player not doing this was CBJ, who just stopped moving/was moving backwards, worried about Ivanovic, who was yards offside to begin with.

1952~~~
Precisely. It felt like it took me about ten paragraphs to say what you did in one lol

At the end of the day, Blind slipped and Costa got through. He's not the next coming of Puyol. I'm just trying to highlight that their are about six other players more accountable than Blind.

1953~~~
It doesn't really leave any scope for discussion, since he didn't get the ball and a goal happened as a result. He also slips as the ball goes past him so the fact he reckons he was getting to it just further proves how poor the judgement he made was. He slips reacting to the fact he isn't going to get anywhere near it...it's very clear when you watch it. 

The other thing that makes trying to blame CBJ completely ridiculous is that Blind is IN LINE with CBJ before he randomly decides to run off after Terry...Costa only moved into an onside position when Blind left a big gap for him to move back into. If Blind's aim was to play Costa offside he didn't have to move up at all. I've only just reallised this watching it back but it's again very clear.

If you ignore the fact that he only slipped because he realised he wasn't getting to the ball and then completely re-invent what actually happened, then yes, this is exactly right. If not then it's completely wrong and a lie instead.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sorry Pele I'll keep that in mind.

Blind was in line with CBJ before he randomly ran off. So you are suggesting CBJ should have read Blind's mind and run off with him in tandem. The daftest thing about that argument is that if Blind just stays where he is Costa WOULD have been offside AND wouldn't have got the ball anyway...Costa only comes back onside by playing off the back of Blind...but that is somehow more CBJ's fault than Blind's? Ok

This is why there is a need for the baby comment I'm afraid. This is a thread titled "Daley Blind 2015-2016 performances" in which people discuss the performances of Daley Blind. If I wanted  to criticise Memphis Depay for not being able to play a simple pass, I'd go into the Mempis Depay thread. Instead though, because I have a differing opinion from you, it must be an "agenda"...I must have an irrational hatred for Daley Blind, because you're too childdish to accept your pre-conceived opinion on him might not be the same as everyone else's. 

Most people, regardless of their stance on Blind at CB, would watch the Chelsea goal and accept that Blind running off, not getting anywhere near the ball and falling over, was a mistake, and that if he hadn't of done this the goal wouldn't have happened. These most people happen to include Daley Blind. You though have invented an entirely new scenario where in it is somehow "6 other people's" faults that this happened. You've come up with some massively over complicated scenario that doesn't even reflect  what actually happened, just to avoid seeing a very obvious mistake by Blind...and then want me to believe I am the one who is refusing to see things clearly?

1954~~~
Nah, it was good dude. The fact that you can breakdown such a "simple" passage of play shows the interest and knowledge you have.  The video of Blind saying shit was class. Blind is a player you want on all your teams, he's an intelligent footballer whom I respect a lot. He's got lovely hair as well.

1955~~~
The fault lay entirely at the feet of Blind, but he otherwise had an excellent game.  And his mistake on the goal was one of good intentions, but it just didn't come off.  He slipped, the ball got through to a free Costa and Bo-Jack almost got the recovery tackle.

1956~~~
I seriously cannot understand how can anyone watch this video and claim he stepped out to make an offside trap. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Few moments earlier before he comes out he does hold the line, but in next few seconds he thinks the the ball is going to be played to Terry and he sprints to intercepts it totally forgetting about Costa and realising it was a wrong option so that's why he slipped. It was instinctive and bad reaction, he thinks Fabregas will pass it to Terry and that's why he came out to intercept it, no way he thought of making offside trap there.

It's not the worst mistake in the world, but it's really interesting how some people won't accept it's his mistake and make the stuff up for him like the one about offside trap.

1957~~~
I was only trying to demonstrate that its a common practice...but thanks for the compliment.

Blind and CBJ were not inline. Blind and Martial have both moved up before the pass is made, CBJ is looking at Martial and remains stationary. He is 1 or 2 feet behind the line when the pass is made.

Blind slips when he tries to stretch and intercept the ball. If he didn't slip, it's perfectly conceivable he would get the ball. Why would he lie about this? Covering up a mistake wouldn't save him from LVG's analysis.

And you clearly do have an agenda. I pointed out that Schniederlin, Mata, CBJ and Memphis all made mistakes...but I haven't gone into all their performance threads to say they a shit and cost us the match. Just admit you don't like Blind and move on.

1958~~~
Blind holds some blame here, our midfield hadn't done it's job in pressing Chelsea, Blind made a split decision to press which was incorrect.

1959~~~
Pathetic from Mata but i expect that from him. Blind shouldn't be rushing out there.

1960~~~
I already stated that I think he made an error of judgement in rushing out. The fact that I agree with your overall summation, to some extent, doesn't make everything you say valid, true or fair game.

I took exception and responded to the fact that you clearly misused his interview to stamp home your opinion and infer that Blind himself supported your argument. He admits to the mistake of slipping, no-one here is arguing that the slip was a good idea but some feel that him attempting to win the ball in the first place isn't blameworthy. The fact that he admitted to a separate mistake has no relevance or bearing on the discussion surrounding his initial actions (rushing out) and shouldn't be used against him or those arguing another point of view regarding his initial actions.

For the record he slips well before the ball has gone by him as indicated in the picture below (he's already on his knees at this point). It doesn't change anything in terms of my assessment of the situation but does suggest that you are over-egging it a little.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/8fj8w2r.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/8fj8w2r.png"/>

1961~~~
It's batshit mental. I mean people are claiming that Blind "stepped up" and yet he ended sprinting past everyone?! I mean, in what world is that "stepping up"?!

It's funny too, because as the play builds you can clearly see him hold his arms out as if to say "here's our line" and CBJ does exactly the same, then he just decides to leg it half a second before Cesc passes, meaning unless CBJ is a mind reader (he isn't) there is pretty much nothing he can do about it.

It's also funny how people are absolving Blind of going to mark someone else instead of THE BLOKE WHO SCORED THE SODDING GOAL <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1962~~~
I'm really not understanding the defences of him for that goal. I mean, I see what the main point is, in that he's trying to go to Terry...but even from that point of view, he fails hilariously by falling over. It's like Wayne Rooney putting a tap-in from one yard over the bar, and people defending it by saying, "Well, he messed it up, but he was in the right position and would've scored if he'd gotten it on target." If Blind decides to run to Terry, then it's surely his job <i>not </i>to slip and to, you know, get the ball? The fact that he does slip mean he's unable to make a quick recovery once the ball is played through, and it's quite clearly an error.

CBJ is also culpable for playing Costa onside, but I'm really not sure if Blind should be leaving Costa, the most dangerous player in Chelsea's side, in the first place. Terry's hardly the fastest, and again, leaving Costa unchallenged, on his own, is quite clearly a daft thing to do...especially when you then fall flat on your arse in the process.

1963~~~
How can anyone think that they are not playing an offside trap there? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Everyone except CBJ was in one line and Costa was well behind that line. Either it's an offside trap or its one hell of a coincidence.<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1964~~~
Because that would be stupid on the edge of the box in the 93rd minute. Blind doesn't just step up to be level either, he goes charging out past everyone like a lunatic. Not a smart way to set an offside trap <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1965~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fl_RIdpcuk0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

In the 28th second they show the replay of the pass to Costa. Everyone other than CBJ are in one line. Costa is clearly behind blind played onside by CBJ. What happened next is actually completely irrelevant because even if he hadn't slipped going to cover terry, he wouldn't have bothered to move like anyone else as they had (or they thought) just played him off and expected the play to be stopped anyway. There's nothing stupid about that. It's the most sensible thing to do and what we would see most intelligent defenders like Maldini baresi and all do.

1966~~~
The point is Blind is sprinting out without knowing where his team mates are. He's running out to Terry for no reason at all. He goes past everyone. It's a stupid thing to do and if he's not sure he should be marking Costa instead of taking risks

1967~~~
Which is the point isn't it? He can't mark Costa without playing him on and he can't obviously account for CBJ playing him on. You are actually blaming him for not realising that the CBJ was not in the line that all the defenders were holding instead of blaming CBJ for not getting into the line in the first place? Wow. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1968~~~
I'm not even absolving CBJ of all blame like you seem to think. If you think he is playing an offside trap why doesn't he just step up in line with Smalling instead of running ahead of him?

1969~~~
I didn't realise how isolated Blind was in this situation, Fabregas is given all the time in the world to pick a pass and Blinds marking two Chelsea players without another United player even remotely near him.

1970~~~
because Schneiderlin who was marking terry lost terry and ended up doing little to nothing instead. So blind moved forward with te intention of cutting out the pass to terry which was the most obvious pass because both Costa and Ivanovic were offside again by the same. He slipped so yes that's stupid from him but to blame him for the goal where he did most things right(the slip shouldn't even have mattered as the play would have stopped if CBJ was in the same line as martial blind Schneiderlin and Smalling) is just dumb. And if you think marking Terry doesn't serve any purpose, ask Everton.

1971~~~
I honestly don't understand all the debate regarding Blind and whether or not he made a mistake for that Chelsea goal.

I really can't understand the sort of fan that hammers a player for this type of thing.  If it was happening every week, ok - understandable.  Blind on the other hand has been excellent for us all season.  I must admit, I had my concerns about him playing centre back at the start of the season... but I was wrong.  Even with all of our defenders fit, he'd probably still be our second best central defender ahead of Jones and Rojo who are both more experienced in that position.  

Also if there was anyone in our team who you would bank on learning from any mistake... it's probably Daley Blind as he's one of the most intelligent players in the side.

1972~~~
Possibly the instinct of his central midfield days - stepping up and pressing like that?

Either way, CBJ shouldn't have been that far behind the line. I think they both made a mistake there.

1973~~~
I really, really rate blind. Fair play to him making such an effort in defence. without him who knows where we would be. Saying that, I still want a proper CB that isn't Jones or rojo.

1974~~~
Lets break it down:

<b>23 seconds:</b> Blind and CBJ hold out their arms as if to say "this is our line" Blind is actually marginally behind CBJ, but that's neither here nor there. Important thing to note is that Darmian, instead of looking around and seeing who he could mark, just decides he'll walk back over to right back... not a great idea considering where the ball is, and the fact that we had men over on his side.

<b>25/26 seconds:</b> With Darmian wondering right, Blind has two men to pick up. Him and CBJ are still in a line together, but Blind decides he should mark Terry, not Costa (the incorrect decision for a number of reasons, not least because you should always pick up the player closest to your goal) - so he begins his sprint.

<b>26/27 Seconds:</b> Blind has sprinted away from CBJ and even past Martial. Leaving Costa unmarked and alone. There is absolutely no chance in hell that CBJ would a) know that Blind was going to choose that exact moment to sprint out of defence - especially as moments earlier they both put there arms out to indicate where the line they were holding should be - and b) could react in literally a second to match his movements and step-out... if you want to be critical, you can say that CBJ isn't even watching the play, which is poor from him, but even if he was, do you think he could have matched Blinds run and moved to be in line with Martial?

<b>28 Seconds - </b>The ball goes through to Costa, Blind realises he's moved the wrong way and falls over trying to adjust his body position. He was nowhere near the ball though (for people saying he'd got it if he hadn't slipped, freeze the clip at 35 seconsds - he's a few yards away from the ball). Costa - the man he should be picking up - has a free run at goal.

People can say all they want "Well what if Terry gets the ball? shoots and scores?" but a) that didn't happen and b) I would rather have John Terry have the ball outside the box then Costa have a 1vs1 inside the box. Ultimately though, if Terry gets the ball, then that's a new situation and we defend the new situation accordingly.

As people have said, the fact that Schneiderlin takes up a naff position isn't great, and yes, you could argue that CBJ should be more aware of whats going on, <b>But </b>he has such little time to react to Blinds movements (if you want to maintain he was playing offside AND stepping out to Terry fine, though you at least have to concede it's a massive risk on his part and not one he should be taking) ... ultimately, considering the fact that Blind wanted to hold a line where he and CBJ were literally seconds before he sprinted away, makes me believe he wasnt' playing for offside and instead tried to guess what was going to happen and went to go stop it (the move of a midfielder).

1975~~~
The goal happened because of a mistake each by Blind (by rushing and then slipping) and by CBJ (by not being in line with Smalling and others when the pass was made). I dont know why people are arguing as if these two things are somehow mutually exclusive and therefore blaming one player automatically means that the other player is without any blame!

1976~~~
Because literally a second or two before the pass is made, he and Blind are in a line together.

1977~~~
Yeah, but if CBJ chooses to look at Martial instead of Blind (where Martial incidentally also moves up along with Blind) then he should also be moving up. He gets caught out of concentration in my opinion. So its not a clear cut case of one single mistake for the goal.

1978~~~
Yeah, like I said, you can certainly criticise him for not concentrating on the play. But it's still a big ask for him to react to Blind sprinting out of defence and moving up himself all in the space of a second.

1979~~~
The 23rd second action is towards everyone behind because at the time even Smalling CBJ and martial were clearly behind blind (much behind CBJ too) and he was rallying them to not go in too deep and play everyone on. Then they(Smalling and martial) went more forward to Schneiderlin's line at which time the game had changed and now blind is deeper and had to move forward. It's the basic requirement that you need to adapt to each change and what's true 2 seconds back may not be true now. So he went forward expecting the offside. Him rushing out was  to intercept the ball. He would definitely have intercepted even the pass to Costa had he not slipped. So the slip was poor from him. Not anything else.

And all these while Smalling is marking no one. Blind ended up having to mark 2 players because Schneiderlin is ball watching after he left Terry, darmian is marking Willian and Mike is standing there marking no one in Particular. If that was Blind in place of Smalling doing the same things then the same posters would have talked about how the 'helpless Smalling who has to do everything by himself whereas the incompetent blind is not even in the area'. 

The question is whether you blame blind for reacting to everyone else, all of whom went for a higher line and not informing CBJ of it (whatever that means) or CBJ for not realising it himself when he can see that everyone are at least 2 yards away. In a football pitch you can't give 2 minutes advance notice before doing stuff like that. CBJ and other defenders should be alert enough to see what is happening. If that was Blind who had played him on the posters would have expected him to instantly react to everyone else and no one 

The only thing we can even blame him for is slipping. Which again I don't know if you can actually blame him for it but still. To blame him for doing something 90% of all the defenders are doing or rather are supposed to be doing is just crazy

The pass to Terry was the only alternative to the pass to Costa and as he intended to play him offside and expected cesc to go for the next alternative he went to cut the pass to Terry. I don't see it as such a big crime that he shouldn't have done. He left Costa because he already took care of that problem (or so he thought).

1980~~~
It's just completely baffling why people do this. It's a very obvious mistake. I think it is a pretty bad one purely because it happened to result in the ball going into our goal. It's clever play from Costa to move up but what Blind does there isn't something any experienced half decent centreback would do...and this is the issue I have.

It's not a one off incident. Even earlier in the game Fabregas ended up with a clean shot on goal from about 6 yards because Blind tried to anticipate which way he'd turn and got it wrong, instead of just marking him properly. He does it far too often...he does a decent job there for someone who isn't a centreback, but against teams who attack us a non centreback doing a decent job of pretending to be one will always get exposed. Something you can witness every time we play a decent side.

On here though, there's a gang of people who just wont accept Bllind can do any wrong, for some unknown reason...and who'll just make stuff up about our games. I guess because they really WANT him to prove he can play there? But it is futile for example denying an error happens when the result of the error is the ball going into our goal. It achieves nothing other than making people look deluded and childish.

They were in line, and then Blind sprinted off after Terry. Any clip of the goal clearly shows this, many of which are in this thread. It's not up for debate or a point of view. Its not even something you can get away with fibbing about. It's just what happened vs making stuff up.

He thought he could get the ball I'm sure, but the replays seem to suggest he was a fecking mile away from getting near it. There's also the most key indicator of all...the FACT he didn't get within a fecking mile of it. Though you may as well just pretend he did?

I don't have an agenda...I'm in the Daley Blind thread talking about Daley Blind. I dont know why you keep saying this. It just makes you sound like a complete idiot.You can't just pretend everyone who disagrees with you does because they have an agenda. I mean, what is this agenda exactly? Did Blind rape my dog?

There are numerous clips in this thread showing him getting nowhere near the ball and slipping after it's  too late to rectify this vs this blurred image of him which proves I'm not sure what since the pass has clearly already been played. Either way, he didn't get to it, and if he'd stayed where he was he would have.

Also, I said he called it a "shit moment from him", which he did. It's pretty obvious he THOUGHT he'd get to the ball, otherwise he wouldn't have gone for it. Fair enough if you think I''m tarting it up a bit. In my view he's made a pretty silly mistake that's cost us the game. Suggesting otherwise seems somewhat daft as evidenced by the daft arguments of people attempting to do so. It was a massivley cheap goal to give away.

1981~~~
One of the shittiest goals we've conceded this season.

1982~~~
He's certainly wasn't marking your dog, that's for sure!

1983~~~
What the feck was Blind doing? Even if Terry had received the ball there, he wouldn't have done anything useful with it. Leaving Costa completely unmarked was idiotic. 

I like him as a player, but when we have to defend a lead, he's a complete liability.

1984~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtJ-NFvquTM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Look at him there, I will never understand how a left back can let an attacker mark a winger, Blind positioning makes no sense, he can't even pretend to mark the midfielder since it's not his responsibility and there is midfielders and a CB in the area.

1985~~~
There are way too many examples of his lack of positional awareness and misjudgement of certain situations in the CB position this season. Don't get me wrong, he's doing a decent job as a whole (especially for a player who isn't even a CB) , but his mistakes are way too many and are costing us dearly. His reactions are slow as well. 

He also has the tendency of having a brainfart while trying to distribute the ball from the back and is slipping way to often. Why the feck does he slip that much?

1986~~~
Blind is marking the winger. It's Glen Johnson that gets behind Depay.

1987~~~
Blind is marking no one and he should defend in the channel.

1988~~~
He's right beside Shaqiri. Who was actually Stokes winger. Trying to paint that as anyone other than Depay at fault is ridiculous.

1989~~~
He is defending out of his zone, in a zonal marking scheme while the opposition is actually attacking in his zone. Memphis makes a really stupid mistakes but Blind makes one too.

Edit: If everyone was disciplined Fellaini would have been near Shaqiri, Memphis where Fellaini was and Blind where Memphis was.

1990~~~
But you're complaining him not marking a winger and that a full back always should and then saying he should be marking a zone. At least be consistent here. Blind plays zero part in us conceding that goal.

1991~~~
By winger I meant the player on the wing, the only one actually attacking.

1992~~~
It's fairly standard fare for a winger to pick up full backs on the overlap. It's not Blind or Fellaini's fault Depay is shite at it.

1993~~~
No you didn't. If he'd left Shaqiri and the ball went to him and he'd scored then he'd be getting blamed for not marking his man. A full back can't be expected to pick up every player on their flank.

1994~~~
And it's fairly standard for a fullback to protect the outside and be the first defender on the wings.

1995~~~
Not if it means leaving your man completely unmarked a few yards infield when your winger is marking his man. Do you actually expect a full back to be constantly swapping with the winger on who they should be tracking?

1996~~~
It's a zonal scheme they don't track, they defend on the player entering their zone, he left his zone to defend in the midfielders zone. If we were in individual marking he would be right but we are not, unless he is the only player on the field in indvidual in that case, I will look at the coaches.

1997~~~
It's not like is stood on the right side of our defence. Say Blind marks Johnson and the ball goes to Shaqiri and he scores you'd be here complaining that he was marking a full back. You've already complained about being in an area and not picking up a man when you thought Glen Johnson was Blinds man.

1998~~~
No, I wouldn't because I already told you that while Blind shouldn't be where he was, other players should have been where he was, if Shaqiri had the ball while Blind was in his zone it would have been someone else business. And you are still in man marking when I'm in zone marking. My problem here is that he left a winger defend alone at the edge of the box, in fact I have a problem with the entire defensive positioning of about 8 visible players, Blind and Memphis included.

1999~~~
You specifically complained about him not man marking. We've both said our piece but for me Johnson is Depay's responsibility all day long. And that would be common place in football.

I specifically complained about his positioning, but I did said winger thinking about the player attacking on the wing at that time (I had no idea who it was), and Memphis should defend infront of the fullback not in place of him but since Fellaini is defending where Memphis should be I suspect that someone else, probably Memphis butchered its assignment. And the reason why your suggestation isn't good is because of what happened, you want a defender to deal with this type of balls, Fellaini or the other midfielders are perfectly able to mark a player inside but the ball played by Memphis is only usual for defenders.

2001~~~
The idea that he sprinted out to play the offside trap is hilarious. Blind has some loyal supporters on here. He made a poor decision. How is that so hard to admit?

2002~~~
It's equivalent to the cult of Kagawa. So ridiculous, it's going to start making you dislike a player you have nothing against.

2003~~~
I probably shouldn't be but I'm surprised at the length and depth of the debate over the goal regarding Blind specifically, the bigger issue came from midfield anyway IMO. 

When the season started I was annoyed that we were using him as a starting CB based purely on him being left footed and a good distributor, but I think he's done a really good job for us, it might not be a fit long term but he's held his end up for the bulk of the season IMO.

2004~~~
It's a bit odd trying to focus the blame on one player when you've got the CB at the RB position, the RB in the CB position marking no one, the DMC in front of the the RB marking no one and the LB behind the line marking no one. Focusing on the CB who's got two players and has to make a split second decision is odd. Cushy enough to sit in your chair and judge but we can't hear the players speaking about who's supposed to mark who. It's a bit pointless without the facts and every argument here is based on each person's perception of what happened.

Simply put it was a series of mistake that started at Chelsea's box and I'm sure the manager was angry with the team as a whole rather than an individual.

2005~~~
No it's because there are lots of posters who wait for him to even make a minute mistake to come out with the 'I knew in August he was not a CB' irrespective of what he does. In the Chelsea goal there are at least 5 people more culpable than Blind. CBJ (playing Costa on), Smalling (ball watching and stuck on the wings marking no one), Schneiderlin (same as Smalling), mata (not closing in on fab and making it harder to pass), Memphis (screwing up what was a run of the mill pass and conceding possession). Yet there are people here who act as if he is the sole reason we conceded the goal. Not only that there are posters who actually couple of pages ago said he was the worst player in the season. Which couldn't be further from the truth. 

Players like him, Valencia, young and are all players who will get scapegoated if they make even a single mistake but give leeway to the likes of Herrera, Smalling, and all get more leeway because people have a liking for them. Whatever blind does is seen as error which may not be the case if it was someone else. For instance if Smalling and Blind had swapped their roles in the goal, people would blame Blind for being lazy and for his poor positioning. He is bound for critiscism every time whatever he does.

At the end of the day, I would also like to upgrade CB position and get someone else in but I don't engage in intense critiscism for no reason.

2006~~~
Similar to your one man band Smalling posts.

2007~~~
Funnily enough it was just a couple of weeks ago when Blind got blamed for a goal when Smalling went chasing out, lost a header and then chased a ball he had no chance of winning. Blind was blamed for losing a header which he won and some even tried to say he chased out when in reality he dropped back watching his man right after winning his header.

2008~~~
Yeh exactly. Most people blame him for every goal that we concede. Of course he did have errors that led to goals like the Bournemouth goal where he left josh King free but there are few other goals where he is culpable individually. A lot of people before the game itself decide that blind will have mistakes and then every Single mistake he commits will be shown to prove he is incompetent. If we don't make any mistakes, then the opposition were poor who didn't take advantage of his incompetence. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

2009~~~
It's a problem with several players, they overpursue when marking or pressing. Blind do it very often and it was one of the main criticism when he was playing DM last season, Fellaini did it often this season but has been a lot more disciplined lately. And like you said Smalling was guilty of it against Derby.

2010~~~
Agree that the goal was a bit of a clusterf8ck. It is true Caf style to have pages of debate on a single players blame in that one moment. Yes Blind made a mistake, but so did the midfielders and CBJ, if only one or two players had made a mistake, no goal. But we had a series of cascading failures in the build up to the ball going into the back of the net. Poor defending/lack of concentration from about half the team was the real culprit

2011~~~
Or Smalling, or Herrera.

Only cults that should be justified are De Gea's and Martial's.

To the point in case, Blind made a mistake, no doubt there. I think CBJ's mistake is even bigger considering that he played Chelsea in onside position. I would also argue that Smalling, Schneiderlin and Darmian made 'mistakes' because they were doing, like nothing, and Blind had either to follow Terry and play Costa offside (assuming that CBJ did his job), or just mark Costa and let Terry free. Unfortunately, he decided to do both (or neither), and so did a great Phil Jones impression, with CBJ playing Costa onside, while the other defenders were just looking curiously what Chelsea was doing. And Memphis after somehow missed a pass which my grandma (she died before I was born) wouldn't have missed, jogged as slow as when Pirlo is having the ball, should have a major part of the blame.

2012~~~
No there are not. This is a thread about Daley Blind where people are talking about Daley Blind. That's literally all it is. That's why people come in here and point out the things he does, because it's the EXACT POINT OF THE THREAD. For some reason you and others have convinced yourselves it's some kind of weird vendetta, as if Blind is the only player on here who's performances people discuss, even though this thread is in the Player Performance Forum, where there is a thread for literally every single player who plays, most of which are posted in after every game.

You will find other players get criticised when they make mistakes, or in general. Rooney gets criticised, Depay, Fellaini, Darmian, Schneiderlin, Van Gaal...basically anyone who's been a bit shit, has been criticised, often brutally. 

It's only you and the other members of the Blind brigade who seem to think this is some agenda or other that relates solely to him, and this all seems to be based on the fact people were concerned about him not being a centreback, which is a weird thing to not accept as a valid concern. He isn't built like a centreback, he doesn't play like a centreback, he doesn't have the attributes typically required of a centreback, he didn't play there last season despite us being desperately short in that area...so it is not farfetched that people might suggest he isn't suited to playing there. Particularly when he makes silly errors in games.

I mean, from the point of view of the rest of us, you get someone telling you that Depay losing the ball in the opposition corner flag is a bigger DEFENSIVE error than one of the centrebacks running off randomly and leaving the opposition striker free to score a goal, and then they find a way to blame most of the rest of the team for this as well, and then a second later they're telling you that YOU are the one with an agenda for thinking they are being a bit thick.

One person even claimed that what Blind did for Chelsea's goal was "the mark of a great centreback", another invented the position "ball playing centreback" so that they could call Blind "the best ball playing centreback in the league", as if this is suddenly a thing...You just make yourself look like completely deranged loons.

2013~~~
Also, Smalling got criticised a hell of a lot for the Newcastle game, and for the Derby goal, and people have been calling Herrera a bit shit for a while, so this idea that there are players immune to criticism and aren't called out for their mistakes - on the Caf of all places - is completely incorrect.

2014~~~
I mentioned 5 players who were more culpable than him. Smalling for instance goes to the wing to mark Willian in the absence of darmian. Then darmian comes back to mark Willian and Smalling just whiles away doing nothing. Same with Schneiderlin who leaves the one player he was marking. Anyone with a little common sense will tell you that when three players are in a line and the fourth is well behind, it's the mistake of the fourth player. There you have silly and useless excuses like 'he didnt organise the defence' properly and stuff. The matter of fact is had CBJ moved up with martial (who is right beside him) Blind's slip wouldn't even have mattered as Costa and Ivanovic would be offside. If he isn't as good as Smalling at organising defence then where is Smalling? And why does CBJ have to be told what to do when martial who isn't even a defender seems to know? I saw your post in CBJ's performance thread where you wrote the goal wasn't CBJ's fault? Which, I'm sorry, is just crap. He is young and inexperienced and I don't hold it against him but it's definitely his fault. If he has not done the basic job of a defender in holding a line with the other 3 then yes you are to blame. Instead you blame it all on Blind's lack of sense in playing centre half? I mean really? At the time of passing the ball, Costa is behind the line. The line had Smalling martial darmian and blind. CBJ is at least 2 yards behind. It's not even close. The slipping was blind's mistake but had CBJ been more alert in the first place that wouldn't even have mattered. Plus the leader of the defence smalling,who im assuming you think highly of as a CB (as he is obviously built for a CB), is standing well away from the action. Where is his organisational sense and positional sense there? The fact is our midfield and defence fully screwed up with Blind maybe 3rd or 4th in line for the culpability.

From your post a few pages back in which you said 'he is responsible for us dropping MANY points' and 'when playing CB, he is the worst player in our squad' (or something of that ilk), it's clear that you had already formed an opinion on him in August and wait for every time he makes mistakes to come in here to complain about. None of that screams to me like you are an 'arbitrary and objective viewer' like you seem to imply. In fact a few others even seem to twist every goal that we concede into something wrong that Blind did. For instance as <a class="username" data-user="69130, @limerickcitykid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69130/">@limerickcitykid</a> said, a few posters even blamed him for the Derby goal when in fact it was Smalling's mistake which clearly proves there is in fact a tendency to critiscize him for little to no reason. I have seen annihilate now praise him in games before so he seems objective enough.

And not fit for CB is something people have been crying about since the start of the season yet Smalling has more errors leading to goal than Blind. Also he has much better performances that actual CBs in other top 4 contenders like Otamendi, mertasacker, Vertonghen and all. People were crying for otamendi in the summer yet he has flopped massively this season. Even stones has been massively poor this season. All this should ideally prove to any average human being that built for a centreback doesn't really qualify into being a good centre back.

I don't claim that he is suddenly the answer to our CB or whatever. In fact as I said in some posts before, I am not at all against the idea of an upgrade but frankly he has been our most consistent performer along with de gea martial and Smalling (even CBJ and shaw whenever they played) and this whole he doesn't know how to play as a CB is nonsense.

2015~~~
the OP in this thread though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think even Blind himself has admitted he made a mistake, it happens. He's been good enough this season to look passed it.

2016~~~
They are critiscized but they get a lot of leeway imo. For instance Herrera needs to play at least a run of 5 games before people will even acknowledge he is playing poor. Then he will be dropped. Cue in two weeks the Same people will claim that 'all he needed was a run of games to prove his class but LvG hates him so won't play him'. People blame everyone from van gaal to Fellaini and lately, even Blind for his poor performances (the logic being that because blind plays, we have to play Fellaini to help out in corners and if a good CB plays, Herrera would be first name on the sheet).

Players like blind, Valencia and all start from negative before the game starts in terms of appreciation for good performance. Meaning if they play well they would be at best mildly praised but if they don't then heavy critiscism.

2017~~~
I know you said five other players were more culpable, but the fact you can watch that goal and come to this conclusions should really disqualify anything you say afterwards straight away. If Blind doesn't make a very silly mistake the goal doesn't happen. The problem here isn't what half the rest of our team was doing, it is your blunt refusal to accept this, even with it put literally right in front of your face.

We have already established that Blind and CBJ WERE in line before BLIND decided to run off after Terry. He wasn't playing an offside trap. Again this is clearly visible and the only course to claim otherwise is to just make stuff up. It is not up for debate, it is what happened and was caught by various television cameras. Even now though, you right a fecking aggressive essay denying that this is what happened. There are clips of it IN THIS THREAD. Why are you still pretending to believe a fantasy version of events? It is not CBJ's job to sprint randomly up the pitch whenever Blind does, otherwise we'd lose every game about 10-0.

Those posts you quote from me "forming an opinion in August" are from about a week ago? They also reference Blind's performances this season, which I generally have not been impressed with, due to his consistent poor defending. Again, you are making stuff up. I cannot pre-form an opinion in August based on referencing things that happened after August. This is not possible unless I can travel in time...which if it were possible would just make it much more likely that I am right.

I'm not sure how naming people like Otamendi helps anyone's cause. He's been awful. Stones also has been poor all season and only now are people on the caf beginning to realise this. What does this have to do with Blind?

Smalling generally has been very good this season so I'm not sure where you're getting your ideas from. He's been our best defender by a very large distance (most of the others can barely stay fit for a week). I'm not sure why you keep mentioning Valencia either as he's been injured nearly all season.

It also seems to be this running sneery theme to laugh off the idea that Blind isn't suited to play at centreback, but he is not strong, or tall, or particularly fast, and he doesn't have good positional discipline, so he isn't in fact particularly suited to playing there. He hadn't been deemed suitable to play there last season despite there being as much need then as there is now. It's very odd to just ignore this.

I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who's mentioned this theory that Fellaini plays to help out at set pieces, and I definitely didn't say Herrera would be the first name on the team sheet if not. Again you're just completely making stuff up. I'm also not sure how you get from that to suggesting I'm blaming Blind for Fellaini playing poorly.

You just seem to REALLY want this agenda thing to be true, but it just isn't. I don't dislike Blind at all I just think he is being misused. I would rather see him in midfield where I don't think he's been given a fair chance yet. I think he's a victim of poor squad management since we've left ourselves for the second year running horribly short of centrebacks who can keep themselves fit (let alone play well). I don't think you'll find anyone on here who hates Daley Blind just because. At worst you'll find people who have become more likely to criticise him just because they know it will annoy people like you.

2018~~~
Truly staggering you're still trying to attribute blame to Blind for that goal. First you say that he should be marking the winger (he was) then you say he's marking no one (you can see from the video that's completely wrong) and then you say because it was 'zonal' defending that should allow his winger to wonder in field alone, this isn't netball! Smalling was a free to cover any ball inside so Blind is perfectly fine to press instead of inviting pressure.
 The players were positionally absolutely fine, it was just an atrocious header.

2019~~~
It's nonsensical. It's not the only thread where it's happened either: the Fellaini one is a primary example, wherein fans will try to deflect criticism by saying that he's being scapegoated when people are pointing out legitimate errors.

2020~~~
Noodlehair is spot on, to be fair. It. Blind misjudged the situation and it cost us. Wasn't his first brainfart in the CB position and won't be the last either.

Sometimes he, just like Van Gaal, tries to be too clever and it often leads to stupid mistakes. There was absolutely no need to close Terry down, even if the ball was heading towards him. Terry is a centre-back. He wouldn't have done anything useful with the ball anyway. Had Blind stayed in his position, he wouldn't have had any problems dealing with Fabregas' pass.

As far as I know, Bortwick-Jackson is not Nostradamus to foresee Blind's random actions.

2021~~~
Pretty much spot on.

2022~~~
I'm sorry but anyone who has played defender can tell you that CBJ is not to blame for that goal. I actually really rate blind (above the average ratings) but he clearly makes the main mistake for the goal. He overushes, slips(which is unlucky) but that slip causes the gap to open up. Even blind himself said if he hadnt of slipped he would have cut out the pass. CBJ is literally stood in the perfect position tho right alongside blind, so i've no idea how people are pinning it on him.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2023~~~
Way to take it out of context. What he said is, he was "sleeping" and read the pass late. That's what his mistake was according to him.

2024~~~
Where in my post have I said that isn't what he said?

He admitted he fecked up and some people still want us all to believe he didn't, that was my only point there. 

I have you now telling me he said he was sleeping and read the pass late, and therefore I took what he said out of context, and someone else telling me he said he slipped and would have got to the ball otherwise, and therefore I'm taking what he said out of context.

So not only do you invent contexts people haven't even put in place but you can't even make your fecking minds up amongst yourselves about what he actually said. 

It's genuinely baffling.

2025~~~
Really genuinely seriously, some of you are actually insane.

You're inventing things that never happened and inventing things people never said in order to convince yourselves there is an internet vendetta against Daley Blind playing at centreback. 

If you're going to turn into a batshit mental conspircacy theorist, at least choose something more interesting to be batshit mental about.

2026~~~
It seems like it's inevitable in this place, a poster takes a disliking to a player (culprit directly above) and will go out of thier way to prove how terrible they are, someone will defend the player over zealously to compensate for the ridiculousness of the first poster and it spirals to 'can't be blamed for anything' vs 'can't do anything right'.

2027~~~
Every time I open this thread, noodle is whipping a dead horse...but apparantly he's not bias.

2028~~~
I'm replying to people replying to me. That's what happens on a forum.

Are either of you able to explain to me why I or anyone else would "dislike" Daley Blind? Since you seem so determined to believe this is the case?

I'm not sure why I apparently dislike him but have already been forced to explain why I don't dislike him in detail once, which was pointless as it has conveniently been completely ignored, despite other things I never said at all being quoted to prove I dislike him.

I am not sure how this approach is supposed to convince me that I'm not conversing with loons.

On the other hand if someone keeps telling me "five other people were more to blame for the goal than Blind" then I will keep telling them they are wrong, because someone needs to tell them before their idiocy takes over this place completely.

2029~~~
Carvalho was a centre-back.

2030~~~
6.0 Average rating
6.0 Your rating

That's Blind to me. A perfect 6. Not a world beater in any position, but can do an Ok job as CB and DM. 

Would i like him to stay? yes, as a back up utility player. 

Objectively, i think he will be gone once LvG is gone, maybe one season later. Thats £75,000 weekly, that we could redirect to better players.

2031~~~
So true. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2032~~~
Oh I dunno, somewhere between saying he's been our worst performer this season and saying he's a poor passer of the ball. Dislike him all you want but when you down play his passing ability you start to sound like a mentalist. But yeah, your 19 posts in this thread have been completely balanced.

2033~~~
The main argument about why blind <i>isn't</i> a CB seems to be hes not tall or strong enough.
Which is clearly bolox.

2034~~~
Carvalho was quick though. Same with Mascherano, it compensates for their lack of size.

2035~~~
And they are extremely intelligent players, Blind isn't at that level yet. Maybe someone like Mourinho can help him develop the mental aspect of defending.

2036~~~
That's a big maybe! He's had a good season but he isn't some sort of rookie. If we're gonna try and develop someone into a top class CB why not just buy a good young CB?

2037~~~
Because I have seen Ancelotti transform Matuidi into a world beater, I want to see an other miracle.

2038~~~
I dont remember carvalho being that quick tbh. I remember him being smart mostly.
Its his first season playing cb and i think he's gradualy improved.
Its mostly just that i dont see an issue at cb, we concede the odd goal and the pair of them have had a few feck ups but who doesn't?

The goals that have pissed me off most are the ones where they walk through our midfield too easily, or the slightly inevitable ones like against chelsea. In both cases i'd lay the majority of hte blame elsewhere.
Otherwise i think theres bigger fish to fry and very few obvious improvements (i like stones a lot but at this particularly point in his development he wouldn't be an improvement imo).

2039~~~
He was pretty rapid - for a CB anyway. I know what you mean to an extent, Blind at CB is hardly one of our main concerns. Jones and Rojo, however, are hardly reliable options, which is especially worrying given that Blind is obviously gonna have a tough time against certain opponents.

2040~~~
I'm not sure what Rojo's done to earn his generally poor reputation on here. He generally looks very solid to me, and there've been one or two really exceptional games that show what he could do as part of a settled partnership.

Regardless, Blind has been good for too much of the time to be considered a problem. I don't see his position as being in any sort of peril, and for me Rojo and Jones between them constitute good back-up, especially with some promising youngsters coming through in that position.

2041~~~
I just mean they're injured all the time. Incidentally I don't rate either of them much anyway though!

2042~~~
I know it's been a while, but I would question what on earth Smalling was doing at right back.

In fact Smalling, Schneiderlin and Darmian all deserve a lot of the blame for leaving Blind in a 1v2. Blind made a decision, albeit the wrong one, to stop the danger before it started. But the aforementioned three are positioned so poorly. Like I've said all season, our defense is vastly over rated. Just before the ball is played into Costa, all three make the same movement towards the wing... what the feck is going on there? We really do lack the brains.

2043~~~
It's more a lack of tactical drills than brain.

2044~~~
You could argue our organisation in defense hasn't been so bad, this season, however, we're prone to stupid mistakes almost every game. I honestly don't think we've a smart bunch in defense.

2045~~~
I blame Schneiderlin mainly, he was marking no one and wasn't cutting off any passing angles either. If he is blocking the pass into Terry problem solved. He came on and was atrocious.

2046~~~
Our organization is terrible, if we weren't winning 1v1 all the time we would have big troubles. You talk about stupid mistakes but there aren't a lot of them but everytime we make them, which is perfectly natural, the collective is unable to compensate.
Just look at the video you commented, there is 5 or 6 players making absolutely no sense, some seem to be in man marking, others in zonal marking, an other group don't understand that pressing involves intensity and a couple are spectators. And all that is fairly common with us.

2047~~~
Fair enough. I don't want to take too much away from van Gaal, in this case, as the improved defense is one of the very, very few positives of his reign, so far.

2048~~~
You're right, that goal was just an absolute mess. Blind gets the majority of the blame for the goal because he made the most evident mistake, he was left in a 2 on 1 situation and made the wrong choice, if we were defensively organised that mistake wouldn't have materialised.

2049~~~
Our players are better individually and that's because of his coaching but collectively he hasn't managed to make us truly organized, I claim that it's a lack of tactical drills but it could be something else.

2050~~~
FWIW he was good.

2051~~~
Bar the one moment where N'Doye could have driven a Range Rover though our defense I thought he had a good game, mopping up several situations.

2052~~~
Yeah he's good at reading the game and good on the ball, but we are severely disadvantaged at set pieces because of his lack of height and physicality. Still don't believe he's a long term CB for us.

2053~~~
Got a really good block in which stopped a goal.

Its a shame we cant seem to have him and Smalling both having good games. Think somebody said it before, but it seems like him and Smalling dont communicate and just play their own game which is not in cohesion with what the other does.

2054~~~
Hes been good, better than Smalling lately, one of the few players I dont feel a deep inner hatred towards right now.

2055~~~
He's been surprisingly decent in defence. But I don't think any other manager would play him there, and Mourinho's first job will be deciding whether Jones will ever be able to play more than 3 games in a row, and if most likely he decides no, get a proper tall strong centre back in.

2056~~~
How many times have Blinds lack of height exposed us this year? Smalling do have the height, but still managed to feck up yesterday.

2057~~~
Blind deserves a lot of credit for a job well done in a position he wasn't born to play.  So many problems get solved by bringing in a proper CB this summer, one of them being the ability to play Blind at left mid in a 433 or even one of the two holding mids in a 4231.

2058~~~
I thought he was pretty ineffectual tonight, didn't really link up with Martial at all and only managed one good delivery in open play.

2059~~~
Our best CB who's actually a midfielder had to play at left back today, and our central defence just collapsed.

Only one of the back 4 who wasn't total wank today.

2060~~~
Horrible at left back, too slow and too minded to pass backwards/sideways, but a lovely cross on him all the same (when he eventually gets forward)

2061~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2062~~~
Who's better? Smalling has reverted back to bambi on ice lately.

2063~~~
you're overreacting, he's been alright, but not world class that's for sure, couple of bad games and people like you call him bambi, that's enough for me... Blind showed many times how incompetent he is as CB and noone makes fuss, wheres when its smalling who makes mistake  everybody' all over him..there is a difference of class between the two.. showdd today he cant mark palyer either..

2064~~~
Concerning if he's our best CB, as much as I like him.

2065~~~
He fecked up for Midtjylland's first shot on target (the header from a corner kick). Other than that, I didn't notice him.

2066~~~
There was a time he would have been one of the less good players in our squad.  

Usually does well, but always the speed question isn't it?

2067~~~
Just rubbish defending for the goal there. I'm not even sure what beat him. I don't think the guy even feinted.

2068~~~
...Carrick (who dived in) is the one he fooled.

2069~~~
I mean before that. Carrick fell over, from what I could see, and he had to try and close down Blind's man after Blind just inexplicably went the wrong way.

2070~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Any excuse to blame Blind.

Carrick didn't fall, he dived in.

2071~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fell over, even with Blind turned that chance shouldn't have arrived, Carrick feebly jumped in about 3 minutes too late.

2072~~~
I still have no idea what Blind was doing. I mean Carrick got fooled and was a bit shite to say the least but Blind seemed to randomly walk away for no apparent reason. Wtf. Shit defending.

2073~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> Apparently because Carrick was fooled after Blind, you can't blame Blind

2074~~~
They were both shit for the goal. Not sure why anyone would say otherwise.

2075~~~
Yeah, you're right. Just saw it again - thought Carrick fell but he dived in miserably. I'd still blame Blind more for going random walkabouts instead of sticking with his man.

2076~~~
Playing two midfielders as main defenders. It had to end like this.

2077~~~
His long ball passing is frustrating. Poorly defended their goal (along with Carrick).

2078~~~
He was stationary on their goal but Sisto is very quick footed and rapid off the mark.

2079~~~
Thought he was really bad overall. Should be thanking Lingard for managing to have a complete stinker.

2080~~~
One of the rare underperformers today.

2081~~~
Surprised his thread hasn't been bumped, I thought he did a good job today with a lot of composure playing next to a creaking Carrick.

2082~~~
He did well today. Passing was a bit off today (but nothing in comparison to Carrick) but he defended well overall. Maybe TFM in for Carrick and Riley at LB next game.

2083~~~
Wily fecker isn't he?

2084~~~
Thought he had a good first half but not so great in the 2nd. A few of his clearances were what you'd expect from a young player on his debut rather than a cultured midfielder playing in defence.

2085~~~
Considering the circumstances I thought he did really well.

2086~~~
How the hell did he win that header from that last ball Arsenal pumped in, he rose like a salmon.

2087~~~
His biggest strength in the CB position, his distribution, just deserted him today. But still a decent performance.

2088~~~
Had 500 more minutes more this season than the next player (Mata). Really been a mainstay in our team and him along with De Gea and Smalling have kept us alive in some way in most competitions.

2089~~~
I thought he did well defensively - especially well considering the circumstances in fact - but he was shocking on the ball. His long passes especially were really bad... kept on turning over possession.

2090~~~
We need height in defense. Fellaini was a very useful outlet when fit. 

Cant wait for Smalling to come back,they make a decent partnership.

2091~~~
Some of his hoofing was annoying.

2092~~~
Did well today I thought.

2093~~~
True. But forgivable given his usually excellent distribution.

2094~~~
I think he's quietly had one hell of a season playing in a position most of us didn't want him anywhere near - not perfect by any measure, but he's become important to us.

2095~~~
Not too bad today.

2096~~~
He's been our best defender this season imo.

2097~~~
He's been a quality signing overall. Really smart footballer.

And yeah, that header at the death was superb!

2098~~~
Still remember the massive outrage in the summer when he was playing in CB. Got to say, he's done very well there.

2099~~~
Even if in the long term he goes on to be a squad player, he's been a very good signing. In today's transfer market he was an absolute steal and his versatility is extremely handy to have.

2100~~~
Had a work colleague go the game on Thursday and the one thing he said that stood out was the amount of distance Blind covered up and down the pitch.

Say what you want about his qualities and inconsistencies but you gotta love his attitude. Sometimes doing the 'mindless' running is as important as your contribution on the ball as Depay showed today. 

Both had good performances imo.

2101~~~
Both himself and Carrick played a smart and very solid match. Nullified the pace of Walcott and the physicality of Giroud, both of which I was a bit concerned about, with consummate ease. As some in here have said, an unsung hero of this forgettable season.

2102~~~
Even if we buy a CB to partner Smalling long term, hes a great squad player to have. Somebody like OShea but better imo. Can play CB, CM, LB for us. 

Ia gree with above, hes been sorta an unsung hero.

2103~~~
His ability to read games from the back is second to none.  Played well.

2104~~~
Spot on

2105~~~
Really stepped up since Snalling's drop in form, defends really well and wins quite some battles you dont expect him to. Quality quality signing, hope he can replicate this for the Dutch NT.

2106~~~
So intelligent and reads the game well.

Along with De Gea, Smalling and Martial as one of the bright spots of the season.

2107~~~
An intelligent footballer who just gets on with him, he's not everyone's cup of tea, but he's been very good for us this season.

2108~~~
If he was a couple of inches taller and was a bit quicker he would be world class. Reads the game as good as anybody.

2109~~~
I think he's in with a shout for player of the year even though David will probably win again.

2110~~~
Typically, he's been pretty much faultless and one of our best players since I spent ages slagging him off. Even against Sunderland I thought he was one of very few who were decent.

Wish he'd stop panicking and punting the ball to no one when we're holding on late in games though. He's not the only culprit, but it makes no sense as other times he'll insist on faffing around with the ball when he's being pressured, so it's not like he lacks composure. He just seems to lose his nerve a bit. And again that makes no sense when you remember the times last season that he'd crop up in the last minute of games to cooly slot in an equaliser looking like the calmest man on the planet.

2111~~~
I personally think Smalling will win it this season, having said the Blind and De Gea have to be in the running. 

Everyone keeps saying we need a centre back to replace him yet I don't see him having a bad game. I personally think if we had Shaw and a new right back he'd be fine for us, Mascherano isn't the quickest and he's not as good a footballer as Blind, at times it's like having a playmaker in the back line. 

I rate him very highly, just a lack of pace that takes from his game.

2112~~~
You're right, Bolt is. Mascherano's very quick though.

2113~~~
Absolutely. Unlike Mike, he hasn't fallen away so drastically.

2114~~~
Smalling has been poor since christmas.

2115~~~
Have to say, didn't think he would be this good at CB, but he has been very good. Always one of our best players, rarely makes mistakes or looks out of place.

2116~~~
I think he's a quality CB

2117~~~
Shocking performance from him so far. Continually giving the ball away. Supposed to be the elder statesman back there, calming influence. Needs to shape up.

2118~~~
Really shouldn't press so high if he cannot handle the physicality of Deeney/Ighalo. Couple of times they've gone in behind with Fosu-Mensah playing catch-up.

2119~~~
Contender for worst individual first half performance of the season so far. Wake up Daley.

2120~~~
One of the worst 45 mins of football I've ever witnessed.

2121~~~
Not been great.

2122~~~
He's been garbage so far.

2123~~~
Is he drunk or what?

He is really lucky that our other players always save him. He makes shocking mistakes from time to time, but we always somehow recover it, but whenever it's other way around we will conceede quite often because he is not the kind of player who will save the situation. I am not saying it's always like that, but it definitely happens that his teammates save him more often than he saves them.

Anyway, shocking half.

2124~~~
Been bloody awful tonight.

2125~~~
Might be the worst half we've seen from a united player this season... and there have been some shockers. Terrible.

2126~~~
What the feck is he doing?

2127~~~
Wow, he is so bad today, one of the the worst individual performances in the van Gaal era.

2128~~~
His picture at the top of the thread accurately represents how I'm feeling about his performance tonight.

2129~~~
What's happened to his passing?

2130~~~
I agree. Simply shocking.

Ighalo's given him a few get out of jail for free cards though, so if he just steps it up in the second half we can still get away with something here.

2131~~~
He's been awful.

I don't understand what he was doing leaving the ball to Ighalo on that backpass chance.

2132~~~
He obviously wanted De Gea to come and claim it, which he easily could have, it was a communication problem.

2133~~~
He should have dealt with it. Terrible defending. Amazing that he's back out for the second half. Wasting the ball consistently was bad enough, but then he's decided to start gifting them chances left right and centre.

2134~~~
Yeah he needs to get a clear early call from DDG in those instances, been terrible though.

2135~~~
What's going on with him?<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2136~~~
Another appalling ball to start the second half. GET HIM OFF.

2137~~~
Get him off asap

2138~~~
Massively shaky.

2139~~~
He started the game by lofting the ball 60 meters into thin air and set the tone.  
Terrible performance

2140~~~
He has been utterly dog cak

2141~~~
Someone is getting a 1

2142~~~
He's not a cb and is a makeshift CB at best. I hope we get a manager next season who buys a CB.

2143~~~
Is he fecking blind or what lads?

2144~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Actually managed a clean sheet with that performacne

2145~~~
This was easily the worst game I've seen him play. Terrible tonight. Missed the last few games, is he in bad form?

2146~~~
How the feck did we manage a clean sheet with this perfomance from Blind? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Was absolutely embarrassing.

2147~~~
Guess he didnt sleep last night. Was abysmal in passing. Defended ok though

2148~~~
You can just laugh,worst game from him imo.

2149~~~
WTF was that? Worst performance he's had in a United shirt, he just lunged from one error to the next.

2150~~~
Abysmal performance and still gets a clean sheet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ighalo did us a huge favour.

2151~~~
When players play like their names...

<span style="color: #ffffff">Poor Danny Shittu </span>

2152~~~
What the feck was that performance?

2153~~~
Come again?

2154~~~
Maybe he's burnt out? He's played almost every game for us. Bound to happen at some point. Hope he gets some rest at the weekend with Smalling coming back.

2155~~~
He does seem to have a knack of getting away with his feck ups, doesn't he?

2156~~~
Had a bet on reaching a certain amount of corners before Watford and he singlehandedly absolutely fecked it with his horrendous distribution, sliced kicks and manic defending. Made Mensah look like the more senior of the two.

2157~~~
Genuinely appalling- we basically won in spite of him tonight.

2158~~~
defending wasnt that bad tbh. He was ok in tackles and interceptions. Main issue for me was how he kept passing the ball to ighalo or any one else. TFM Blind CB partnership is a no no

2159~~~
Absolute shocker. Miracle he wasn't punished.

2160~~~
Well, he can't be any worse than that.

Clean sheet, wtf?

2161~~~
Nothing went right for him tonight. He has basically shown himself to be a limited player. Need to buy another CB now!

2162~~~
Worst individual performance this season. Shocking and in the game where he was needed most.

2163~~~
thank god ighalo couldn't score in a brothel right now.  that was an awful performance

2164~~~
He had a tenner on Ighalo scoring first.

2165~~~
As bad as a match as he had (and it was the worst ive ever seen him have for us), it boggles the mind that he wasnt subbed cos he looked mentally done. I know people will say we dont have options, but surely putting Rojo next to TFM would have been better (it couldnt have been worse) and then somebody like Riley LB or just push out Blind LB for a while (or just bring on McNair).

We got away with it through luck.

2166~~~
Wasn't expecting that kind of performance from him, was terrible. Too many short passes, Good job Watford didn't punish us

2167~~~
Could well be burnout. He has barely had any rest this season, the only game he's missed might be Everton if my memory serves me correctly. If Smalling comes back, it might be time to go for a period of games with him and either TFM or Rojo in the center of defense for a while.

2168~~~
I've never seen him feck up so much, so often. Looked tired to be honest but he has been splendid recently so I can forgive him one bad performance, if he's like that on Sunday however...

2169~~~
What the feck was he thinking raising his leg in the box and nearly conceding a moronic penalty? He didn't stand a chance of reaching the ball. It really pissed me off.

2170~~~
A combination of tiredness (mental and physical, he's had nothing resembling a break this year), being the senior centre back for the first time and Deeney and Ighalo being possibly the toughest partnership in the league for a centre back to face in many ways.

But the lad had an absolute howler. I don't think he found a red shirt with a single pass and it was a credit to Fosu-Mensah that he covered for so much shite out there. As soon as Smalling gets back, Blind needs a couple of weeks off. Would love to see TFM get a match or two alongside Mike.

2171~~~
I have no idea what that was...

2172~~~
The worst individual performance by a United player this season. Tried to lose us that single handedly. Drop him when Smalling returns and partner Smalling with Fosu.

2173~~~
One of the worst individual performances I've seen from a United player.

2174~~~
Somebody really needs a nice long rest <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2175~~~
Need a rest most probably. Tired performance. Just need to get refreshed/bench treatment like Wazza, Mata before.

2176~~~
Never seen Blind so sloppy with his passing. Terrible today, but to be fair, before today he had been pretty consistent all season. Needs Smalling back next to him I think to mop up beside him so it isn't Blind doing the mopping up.

2177~~~
At a certain point it did become pretty funny/comical just how badly things were going for him... so that was somewhat entertaining at least.

2178~~~
It was just one of those games where nothing was working - I remember Scholes' having one a few years back, against Fulham I believe. 

I wouldn't read too much into it. Blind is a very solid player who just occasionally has these moments (like that bizarre incident earlier this year where he contrived to fire the ball into his own net - thankfully play had been whistled dead, if I remember correctly.) I'm not totally sold on Blind as a long-term answer at CB, but tonight isn't the game to base that decision on. It was just a howler from him (I actually saw the second half; was the first as bad?)

2179~~~
I am just going to write that off as tiredness.. Even smalling before he got injured, had similar games.

Needs a few games off.

2180~~~
Incredibly, it was about 10 times worse.

2181~~~
My God, that's saying something! It was one of those where even when he made a seemingly sensible decision, the ball would bounce back off the ref or a teammate. He could probably use a rest; sadly can't see that being possible.

2182~~~
TBH, Im not even angry,we won. I just had a good laugh.. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he was consistently decent for us dthis season and played a lot, just needs rest. Hopefully Mike's back soon and we can play TFM next to him:-)

2183~~~
He was terrible tonight, but that can happen to all players and we got away with it anyway. He's mostly been pretty good during his time at Utd and he has that incredibly rare skill for Utd players of not being injured all the fecking time.

So I wouldn't be too harsh on him.

2184~~~
Huh?? He can have this one as a freebie as he's been very decent and consistent for us but he needs to get his A game on at the weekend. Watford pressed very high and had great organisation which did make it difficult for him to progress the play and we couldn't get out, I think he just froze up made a couple of bad passes and he went shaky from there. Not going to use it as a stick to say we need a proper cb blah blah because the problem was primarily with his passing.

2185~~~
Easily his worst performance in a United shirt.

He will get back up from this though. He's a solid character.

2186~~~
Just an off day guys. He will back to business. Missing his buddy Mike. They both make a killer partnership!

2187~~~
This is THE last time I praise a United player before a game.

2188~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That's all you've got to say about that horror show?!

2189~~~
Haha.

I don't think you can say much more really. You can't legislate for a performance like that with any kind of logic or pretending to know about things. Sometimes players just use a game to have some kind of mental breakdown I guess.

Either that or he's on drugs.

2190~~~
In fairness, some stinkers aside, he's been incredibly consistent this year. 41 games played though, feck <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2191~~~
Absolute Worst performance in Utd shirt since Fellaini vs Newcastle, and easily the 2nd worst individual performance by utd player this season and even in post Ferguson years

2192~~~
When you are using the same eleven for 4 games in a row in a space of 10 days its normal that most of them will be tired, like Blind and Herrera. I dont think that Blind is a great cb just a stop gap, he is too slow and weak for the role. But his level for sure its not giving gerrardesque pass to Ighalo.

2193~~~
Think he's going to be with us a long time y'know, I really like him as a player I just wish he'd been allowed a role in CM at some point this year. He and Mata have done very well so far regarding injuries.

2194~~~
Kneejerk reaction after a bad game. Limited how? He's been one of our most dependable players this season, and he's one of the team's best passers

2195~~~
He's not a CB. We need a new CB to play alongside Smalling. Blind could cover at CB if needed but he should be played in DM.

2196~~~
Christ, how long have you been waiting to jump down his throat?

One bad game, after a season of pretty great performances, and the knives are out from some.

2197~~~
So you'd be happy having Blind at CB facing Messi-Neymar-Suarez, Costa-Lewandowski-Robben, Ronaldo-Benzema-Bale? So you don't think United need a new CB?

2198~~~
90% of world s defenders would struggle against them though. I doubt even smalling could handle any of them very well.

2199~~~
Because all those players have defenders better than blind in their back line? Our best defender is smalling. Blind compliments smallings skill set. I'd be happy with those 2 as our best pairing. Are you saying smalling plus x would be far better if so who is the realistic signing?

2200~~~
Fair enough but id be a lot more confident with Smalling dealing with them than Blind. Blind is a very good player and id want him played more as a CDM but he is too small and slow to be a CB imo.

2201~~~
That's what I was saying initially. Blind is a good player and him and Smalling are our best pairing at the minute but we need a more natural CB to partner Smalling if we want to challenge for trophies. Laporte or Stones would be the best options.

2202~~~
He really isn't a centre back though. He's a good player and would be an excellent squad player but should never be starting regularly at CB for us. He's done a good job considering we haven't had a settled back 4 most of the season but our defence has been carried by De Gea and Smalling.

2203~~~
He's been better than Smalling since christmas. I think thats a notable time frame in its own right, because he's out performed Smalling at a time when we've moved away from as possession orientated a system, one which, it was said, was the only system he could do well in.

Infant, he's been perfectly good all season. All this nonsense about him back there is because people are afraid to it admit that Van Gaal got this one right, he can play there, and he can play there perfectly well.

Frankly, this desire to replace him is a little odd to me. Its been shown time and time again that systems make defenders and simply signing a 'big name' centre-half doesn't guarantee they'll strike up any sort of partnership with what you've got.

2204~~~
Will never be a top centre half but I think we all realize that. But my God if anyone deserves a freebie it's Blind. Has been brilliant mainly in trying circumstances, could do with a rest.

2205~~~
He has now played more games at CB in his career than in midfield.

2206~~~
But why? It really seems to me that people are generally simply uncomfortable with what is perceived to be not natural. After the CL final last year, Souness was still criticizing Barcelona about how they can improve by replacing Mascherano with a more natural CB. This is the same Mascherano that was a mainstay in one of in not the most successful club in history. In my view, defence more than at any time in history is no longer about the individuals. Not a single modern defender can make the difference as they could in the past and that is not because there are not any good defenders any more but simply because managers are working more towards team oriented exercises to stop conceding possession and or chances. What this means is that we can no longer apply the traditional criteria by which we judge defenders especially at a team that plays or attempts to play in a more modern way. I have no idea if Blind is the best we can have or not because I am not educated enough in modern tactics and modern demands but what I know is just because we had Rio and Vida producing some of the best defensive displays seen in the PL, doesn't mean that all football teams function the same or need the same set of skills.

2207~~~
No, not a knee-jerk reaction. He started the season very well I thought but only in relation to the very low expectations of him. He did well in defense despite his physical limitations (surprisingly well I thought). More importantly he was an important source of creativity in the team even as we struggled to create chances, but again only in relation to the initial expectations of him. If he is to be a mainstay of our starting 11 as he has been, then our expectations of him have to be higher. However throughout the season he has been highly inconsistent both in his defensive performance and his passing from the back. He has regularly had howlers in defense and his passing often deserts him at crucial times. He certainly is well below in passing ability of people like Carrick etc. This is a big problem in my opinion as this is supposed to be his key strength. If he can't help us in dealing with opposition pressing our defense (like Watford did in the other game), then what exactly is the point of having him?

Don't get me wrong. He has been an important player for us this season (definitely above average - although that's not saying much). But I was hoping that he would kind of grow in performances over time. But he hasn't. And plus he can sometimes be opposite of a dependable player, highly inconsistent and prone to unexpected mistakes. Therefore as it stands I would rather buy a new CB (or promote from academy!) and keep him as a squad player for the CB, LB and CM position.

2208~~~
He's not a CB, I agree, but he's done more than a good job there. I think he's the player with the most minutes in the squad and he might be tired (he's only missed two league games), it happens. Lets not forget however that Blind has looked better as Smalling's partner than anyone else, and let's not forget that he's been a mainstay in a defence that is the <i>second best</i> in the PL as we speak. Passing wise Blind is as good as Carrick and statistically he's blown Carrick out of the water in every passing stat except for pass completion (Carrick is at 87, Blind at 85).  He's also one of the most comfortable players on the ball. A few bad performances doesn't change that.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://befunkycartoonizer.s3.amazonaws.com/C3011150-1457102201291419large.jpg" src="https://befunkycartoonizer.s3.amazonaws.com/C3011150-1457102201291419large.jpg"/>

2209~~~
You have to compare stats per 90 minutes, not per game. When an appearance is 89 minutes for Blind but Carrick's avg appearance is only 67 minutes then stats per appearance comparison is pretty meaningless.

2210~~~
Pretty pointless comparing forward passes as well when Blind is playing further back so will obviously be playing forward passes more

2211~~~
Blind is not a CB. He is small and slow which is two features that a lot of strikers would love playing against. Ighalo is a good example. A big and strong ST that would of had five goals or more if he had his shooting boots on. Blind has done well this season playing there though but we can't go into next season with him at CB imo. I'm a fan of Blind's though and hope he is given opportunities at CDM but not at CB.

2212~~~
But that is only a problem if you invite teams and let them have a go at you. The idea is to not do that and control games through possession and winning the ball back as quickly as possible. That is why you see a lot of managers deploying defenders like that. Of course it is a system that has its limitations when for example as you point out, you do have to defend. But every system has shortcomings and the only measure is how often do you concede chances. When we have Smalling in and are in control of possession, we do not concede chances and that's reason enough to suggest that the defensive side of our game with Blind in it works. It is different than what we are traditionally used defensively but it is equally if not more efficient.

2213~~~
Blind's pretty quick for a centre back.

2214~~~
I like Blind but his physical limitations have been unmasked by Ighalo and Pelle pretty badly this season. He can't be a first XI CB.

2215~~~
Stop comparing him to Mascherano.

Mascherano if he was taller would be the best defender in the world. Mascherano is better defensively, more aggressive and positioning wise miles better.

2216~~~
I get what your saying but I would want a more natural CB to pair Smalling for next season.

2217~~~
If he gets his head out of his arse and realise that he is a senior figure in the squad then he will be fine but he plays with such a deference to everyone else around him.

2218~~~
I love Blind, he's such an intelligent player and the best passer in our team. His physical limitations are greatly exaggerated in this place, any time he loses a header you get 'told you so comments', like other defenders don't get outpaced or lose out physically, ever.

That being said I would like us to bring in another central defender to partner Smalling next season. Blind is more than capable of covering at centreback, he can also play back up to left back and central midfield, he'll still see more than enough time at this club due to his versatility to want to stick around. He's essentially O'shea 2.0.

2219~~~
No he isn't. He's very slow. The modern CB is not only very good with the ball but relatively fast these days too.

2220~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> are you serious? Even compared to a GK he is slow.

2221~~~
How the feck he survived the Watford game and starts today is a mystery. Should have played Mensah with Smalling, Blind needed a dropping and a rest.

2222~~~
Small and slow are also two thing stopping him from being a decent CDM. He presses forwards when nobody else then we've got a massive gap in front of our defence where he should be because he can't get back into position quick enough, plus he gets bullied off the ball by other centre midfielders.

Rondon and Berahino are gonna have fun against him today I think.

2223~~~
No, he's slow for a midfielder, that much is obvious, but compared to other players even 'modern CBs' he's by no means slow, its the slowest position on the pitch by far.

I'm not saying he'd comfortably out-sprint him, but he's definitely not slower than Nemanja Vidic was, and his speed was never a problem for him.

It's a far bigger issue for him in midfield than it is at centre-back.

2224~~~
Vidic didn't need speed when he was winning every header and let Rio worry about the speed. 

Blind doesn't win every header. He's hardly commanding.

2225~~~
What even is your point? Vidic's only real limitation in his game was dealing with speedy players. I'm sure you don't need explaining why Vidic was a far superior defender to Blind, either.

And his pace is just as detrimental to him in midfield as it is at CB. Players can get the run on him in either position, and he lacks the physicality to do anything about it. That much was painstakingly obvious against Watford just last match.

2226~~~
He has got 'dominated' in a handful of games. He dealt with Kane, Benteke and many other forwards well.

2227~~~
Surely the point is obvious? I don't understand how you don't get it.

You're probably aware of the fact that centre backs are rarely blessed with pace. Thats as true in the modern game as it was 50 years ago. It's the position on the pitch where you regularly find the slowest players.

In comparison to other CBs, and I mentioned Vidic because he's probably the best player defensively any of us have seen, Blind is really not slow. Concerns about his pace as a centre back, are largely misplaced.

There's clearly legitimate reasons to worry about his height, heck even his strength, but if and when Blind is replaced in the summer whoever comes in is not going to be a significant improvement over him in terms of pace and, if anything, may well be slower. Of course he may get outpaced from time to time, every defender does because, invariably, the oppositions fastest players play up front. A lack of pace is a stupid criticism to level against Blind at centre-back. Even more so when the same people citing that as a reason why he should not play there advocate moving him into midfield.

Also, can we just forget about the Watford game please? He had probably the worst game of his United career, theres no reason to draw conclusions from it unless it becomes a habit. He also wasn't really, I don't, think bothered at all by Igahlo's physicality he just spent all game passing to him.

2228~~~
Needs to stop running up the pitch and trying to put pressure on always. His positioning is crap. 

He did the same last year in midfield.

2229~~~
Except that he had the one omost interceptions in the league last season. Kind of hard to achieve that if your positioning is crap

2230~~~
So you thought he was good in midfield? He was rushing forward as CDM. Why do you think we signed Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger?

2231~~~
Why is this guy considered an 'intelligent' player? Utterly brainless.

2232~~~
Agreed, his positioning is just terrible, he just chases random players all around the pitch leaving lots of space.

2233~~~
because he is calm on the ball, this days this is enough to be "intelligent"....our left defensive side is utterly brainless, him and Rojo are a joy to watch<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2234~~~
Because he was the only one to cover Carrick. And he also covers LB and CB. And Carrick was injured most of last season so obviously he can't be relied upon.

2235~~~
Hipsters.

2236~~~
Because he has the vision to see and execute a good pass as we have seen multiple times this season and last.

2237~~~
He can make a pass of two when under no pressure. He is the philosophy mascot.

2238~~~
No don't say that because <a class="username" data-user="95869, @prath92" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95869/">@prath92</a> has the stats to show that's not true!

Don't watch the game. Read the stats.

2239~~~
Another poor showing thus far, he's looking really jaded to me.

2240~~~
and whats that got to do with football intelligence?

2241~~~
having the vision to see the movement of a player and ability to accurately pass it to him from about 30 yards away? That's not something a lot can do.

2242~~~
Great positioning for the goal eh <a class="username" data-user="95869, @prath92" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95869/">@prath92</a>.

Why did he leave his man? Brainless.

2243~~~
Great work from him in the box, staying with Rondon.

2244~~~
His brain did a good job of marking his body.

2245~~~
One of many of our players who just are not good enough.

2246~~~
Another dodgy game.

2247~~~
Totally missing for the goal. Rest of the defence + Carrick shocking too to be fair.

2248~~~
He's no cb

2249~~~
He wont start much under a new manager especially at CB.

For me, he's a great utility player as a squad option. So i'd still keep him.

A new John O'shea of sorts.

2250~~~
With Blind as our mainstay CB all the time, there is just one result, losing.

2251~~~
Good squad player, not good enough to be starting at centre back. Abysmal defending for the goal.

2252~~~
He does this so many fecking times I have no fecking idea how anyone rates him there. What the feck was he doing? feck off.

2253~~~
See, it's not for performances like Watford that makes me think he's not a CB... that's just a one of shithouse of a game and can happen to anyone... it's for ridiculous defensive decisions in the build up to their goal that makes me think he's not a CB.

2254~~~
I'm still trying to work out why the feck he ran next to Smalling and left his man free.

2255~~~
Still don't quite understand why he's playing in Rojos position. Ball playing and all that but center back is defending first and foremost.

2256~~~
Spot on been saying this for 2 seasons now!

2257~~~
He does it every fecking game. In the game against the midgets at OT he randomly went in the opposition direction  of the ball for no apparent reason.

2258~~~
Philosophy

2259~~~
That was such a stupid set piece. Why didn't Blind let it off for Depay to go in? His set pieces are pretty bad.

2260~~~
Not good enough at the end of the day. May be a good squad player eventually but should not be a starter.

2261~~~
In the last two games he has faced sides who play with two up so he has had to play more like a traditional centre half and he has been totally out of his depth.

2262~~~
If he hoofs one more long ball I swear <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2263~~~
Should have been rested after his nightmare against Watford. Another obvious decision Van Gaal failed to make.

2264~~~
This supposed intelligence that he's supposed to have. Where is it?

I've been defending him for it, but recently he's been flat out retarded. In the build-up to the goal, he goes through the back of a West Brom player, pleads his innocence to the ref and then stops playing instead of going for the ball, as if the ref had blown the whistle. What's the point of pleading innocent if you're going to act guilty? And then his acting for the goal itself was absolutely pathetic. If he's our starting CB next season we're in big trouble.

2265~~~
He is too weak.

2266~~~
He's a great player to have in the squad.  He's not great to have as first choice.

2267~~~
Shit lately.

2268~~~
you are mixing apples with oranges......vision is one thing, passing is different thing and football brain/intelligence is third thing. Look at Coutinho for example, has first two in abundance but lacks intelligence.

2269~~~
Can't wait for Mourinho to bin him.

2270~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> Can you gif 65:35-65:40. Absolutely pathetic behaviour.

2271~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/37us" width="560"></iframe>

Where the hell is he going? What is he trying to do?

Blind has done some weird defending at times this season, but that tops the lot.

2272~~~
Not his fault. Who else are we going to play as CB ffs? 

He's a useful squad player but he's no CB but right now we arent exactly rich on defensive options.

2273~~~
It's that moment when he suddenly stops, and must think, "Oh, wait, I'm meant to <i>stay </i>with the opposition's dangerous attacking threat in the penalty area."<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2274~~~
He is our first choice CB since pre season

2275~~~
No it's not his fault that he's playing CB. But come on man explain what he is doing for the goal?

2276~~~
Poor again today, I've never thought he was the solution at CB long term however I think right now he's shattered, he's had no rest at all, we saw today how sharp Smalling looked after getting a few games off.

2277~~~
Rojo has literally been played out of position all season to suit this shite fecker.

2278~~~
This is the same fecking bullshit as against Chelsea - probably thought he could intercept the ball and left Rondon all alone in the box. He's slow, his positioning is fecking dreadful and his passing is massively overrated. Did nothing but faff around with the ball only to hoof it to no one time and time....and time again.

2279~~~
That's on LVG for not buying one in either the summer or January though.

Considering we started the season with 2 Centre Backs (Phil Jones absolutely does not count) - and they two were both on the field today... so yeah...

2280~~~
It's been a long season for him, he's been ran to the ground, no wonder he's producing these kind of performances. I would use him less from now on and play him in the EL on important matches and play TFM in the league.

2281~~~
This video sums up our pathetic defending all over the pitch, absolutely pathetic

2282~~~

2283~~~
Yeah I blame LVG for not buying another CB and playing Rojo out of position to accomodate Blind. 

Seriously, I think Blind is just being set up to fail by LVG each game he starts at CB - guy is clearly not cut out for it and I feel for him tbf. What is he going to say? No way?

2284~~~
How has he been ran into the ground? He's played in a good number of football matches which is hardly surprising considering he's a professional footballer. He just isn't very good as a centre back.

2285~~~
...

2286~~~
He played very well as a CB in the first few months of the season, only lately he started producing all kinds of brainfarts. I put it down to him playing nearly all games but hey i could be talking bollocks.

2287~~~
He's looked like a 10 year old playing the last couple of games. Running around after the ball, clearances not even making it to the half way line and long passes dropping 10 yards short

2288~~~
At fault for the goal but we are told he is knackered and need a rest so why play him. Credit to him at the end for being the only one out of our defence who realised the ball needed to go into the box while Smalling is pointing at the man on the ball to pass it sideways.

2289~~~
Needs to be dropped now. That's two shocking performances in a row.

2290~~~
This was stupid as feck. Incredibly lazy.

2291~~~
Mediocre player.

2292~~~
Thanks. Made me so angry, especially since they went on to score right after that.

2293~~~
Blind is not up to the standard we should be aiming for. Not even close! He's always too late at everything and he's just not a good defender. 

And what has also been bugging me for a while now is that I fail to see why he's apparently seen as some kind of corner kick specialist as he's always taking them from both sides for whatever reason. He's no Frank De Boer but apparently someone (LVG?) at United thinks he has these same qualities that FDB used to have. He's average at them at best.

He's just not very good and he should only be some utility player ar LB and even that is a major stretch.

As long as LVG is our manager, Blind will keep his place. 

Sack LVG, sell Blind!

2294~~~
Thats the question... LVG himself said he's tired and needs a rest, yet still plays him? It's just daft.

Also, didn't Fergie often say that CB's need resting less because they don't through as much work in a game of football? Which is why Rio and Vidic would play around 50 games a season?

Blind's currently played 39

2295~~~
The weirdest thing to me is that Van Gaal obviously likes him at CB for his left footed distribution. Last year our play from the back was pathetic at times, and the lack of central defenders who could pass properly looked like one of the reasons the philosophy wasn't working.

This year our distribution does look better with Blind than it did without him last year, at times during this season his build up play has been excellent. This hasn't helped our football or creativity at all though, we still struggled many matches and countless times we've created feck all. I really don't understand this, the only conclusion I can draw is that having a center half who's good at passing does in reality barely help a team creating something <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2296~~~
He's more rash and ill-disciplined than Rafael was, yet seems to get away with
Rio always missed a chunk of the season through some injury. Vidic occasionally did too.

2297~~~
<b>Rio

05-06 - </b>52 games
<b>06-07 - </b>49 games
<b>07-08 - </b>51 games

<b>Vidic

07-08 - </b>45 games
<b>08-09</b> - 55 games
<b>09-10</b> - 33 games
<b>10-11</b> - 47 games

2298~~~
We don't play the same football as when SAF managed either. 

Blind's clearly knackered. Give him a rest LVG!

2299~~~
Probably best to take him out behind the barn tbh.

2300~~~
I'm not denying that he's knackered - it's fairly obvious, and LVG has said as much himself (which is why I find playing him - when we had Smalling and Rojo back - to be really dumb) ... just pointing out the stats.

2301~~~
He needs taking out. He's been crap for weeks. He needs a rest. 

He's been bullied by forwards. Far too small and weak to go up against Rondon, Igalo and Deeney.

2302~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pulling out a post about a match months ago out of context.

Well done dipshit. Got anything else or just spent your time trying to find my post in the archives ?

2303~~~
Not a centre back.

2304~~~
I was agreeing with you. He's all about intelligence, intelligence and intelligence.

2305~~~
I'm like a gypsy curse, the moment I praise a player, they turn shite!!

2306~~~
It's frustrating because I do think that he has talent but he doesn't seem to be mentally strong enough to me. Seems that as soon as he makes a mistake in a game his confidence goes

2307~~~
He was also all about midfield before LvG decided to mess with his role. Why didn't you pull that post out of the X-Files ?

He should never been taken as a long term solution for CB spot in the first place even despite his great performance against Pool. If I remember correctly he was solid then... for a midfielder in defense.

2308~~~
I'm not a fan of him playing central defender, but I do think people are being harsh on him. Up until two or three games ago Blind had actually been doing pretty damn well in the role for a couple of months. Much better than I was expecting him to do when LVG first started playing him there.

He obviously needs a break now and hopefully with Rojo back we'll do that, but once he's had that break I wouldn't say no to Blind coming back into that role as first choice partner for Smalling until the end of the season. Would depend if anybody else stakes a better claim on that role of course.

In saying that, obviously we do need to buy a proper center back to partner Smalling going forward (Laporte is my preferred option).

2309~~~
He's been good most of the season, just looks like he needs a rest at the minute. Mensah or Rojo can slot in for now.

2310~~~
People are not harsh on him at all. It's just the philosophy screwed with everyone's mind so much and to the point when at times we started to think Fellaini is a classic midfielder, Mata winger, Blind a classic CB and Rooney classic number 9.

We're still about to find out who's that Fosu Mensah chap is, lucky for him he's still in that kind of age when he's just hungry of football and doesn't care too much about a main role he'll get.

Going back to Blind's problem, we can give him even full month of rest and the effect may be very similar as he surely wasn't prepared to just throw everything he learned in Amsterdam and suddenly become full time central defender. People can criticize him all day long as long as they remember the simple fact, he's not playing on his nominal and his physicality isn't exactly proper characteristic for a PL defender and that won't change for sure as he'll be 26 in three days.

2311~~~
Any stattos got the number of long balls hoofed forward by Blind and Rojo today? Must of been over 40.

2312~~~
Which will end up being comparable come end of the season.

Not sure it's fair to expect a fairly young, relatively new to the league midfielder playing centre back under Van Gaal to be as endurant physically and mentally as 2 seasoned vets playing under Fergie. 

You've spoke multiple times about Smalling needing a rest this season and excusing him of a drop off in form due to tiredness.

2313~~~
Absolutely mind boggling what he was doing for that goal. Just went blind for a second I'm guessing. 

Stupid defending.

2314~~~
Exactly... and Rio and Vidic were only a year older then him when they were racking up those numbers, and no one ever thought they were tired.

I'm not saying he shouldn't be tired, or rested... nor that it's his fault that he is... as I say, LVG himself said he needs a rest, which makes it completely feckin' stupid that he still selected him today.

The point is why are our players under LVG, and particularly our defenders, looking so tired? It's a rhetorical question as we all know the answer...

2315~~~
I am one of his biggest fan here, but he was a bit shocking today, and hasn't been that good for a few games now.

Definitely needs to be rested/dropped for a couple of games.

2316~~~
The logical solution today would have been Rojo at CB, TFM at LB and Blind at CM. Instead we played two players out of position with another CM who looks completely done at the top level.

2317~~~
He's tired (probably played every single game). Also he's not a CB

2318~~~
Needs to be dropped or rested which ever. He was at fault for the Arsenal goals, then followed it up with a dreadful performance against Watford and today he was arguably just as bad as in the Watford game. Not only was he at fault for the goal but every time he got the ball he hoofed it to no one in particular, honestly Sunday league stuff.

2319~~~
Today was a really good chance to rest him. Play Smalling/Rojo as CBs, TFM as LB especially after his showing against Watford. Its bonkers it didnt happen.

2320~~~
Too weak and crap positionally to be a centre back, too slow to be a left back and hasn't performed in midfield. Maybe he can take Carrick's squad role next season, but I don't see where he ever starts in a top side.

2321~~~
I can't remember who keeps saying "he defends like a midfielder" that is completely true. He is prone to this insane need to chase the ball around like a wild animal and he forgets he literally has nobody behind him if he fecks it up. That is two goals he's now cost us and both of them resulted in us dropping points at significant times.

I get that having the most crippling, boring, bland and safe setup in front of him with two unadventurous DM's to control the ball deep was the perfect foil for him to not actually have to do any defending. But now we can't get by on that system. It has gotten to the stage where we now have to play actual proper football to win games otherwise we will fail and Van Gaal will be sacked and it is no coincidence that without the ultimate safety net of the most watered down, siege-mode possession that, fancy that. He's not actually a very good central defender.

2322~~~
The blame lies in LVG.

-Blind is exhausted and out of position
-Carrick is exhausted and on the decline
-Rojo out of position
-Other CB options available

Still plays Blind at CB. Just setting Blind up for failure.

2323~~~
His lack of discipline to sit back and defend the space is costing United. Every time he rushes into midfield he exposes the whole backline and basically forcing the CMs to drop in. 
This constant interchange of position when back peddling is responsible for the majority of goals conceded this season. Btw not just him, even Smalling is also engaging in this insanity. 
You are playing as a CB, just sit back and defend the space.

2324~~~
What was his idea of marking Rondon in this game all about?

He kept standing off him, letting him bring the ball under control, and then running in close to him, allowing Rondon to just turn and take him out of the game EVERY SINGLE TIME. He even did something similar for the goal. What on earth did he think he was achieving?

Why did he keep appearing on the left and right wings? Why did he keep disappearing completely meaning the rest of the defence kept having to shift across to cover for him? Why did he keep sprinting up the pitch miles out of position, both with and without the ball, to do absolutely feck all of any use?

THe Watford game was a freak nightmare performance but this was THE 90 minute example of why he should never be playing at centreback. He has no idea positionally and he is incapable of dealing with physical strikers on even a completely basic level. The goal was utterly pathetic yet again...none of the other teams around us in the table would ever concede that goal, and they're not exactly great at defending themmselves...sorry but another game that goes down as one we might not have lost if Blind wasn't being asked to pretend to be a centreback. It has happened so many times this season it's ridiculous. It will be the difference between us scraping top four and finishing about 7th.

We had a second left foooted centreback ON THE PITCH for feck sake.

2325~~~
LVG hung McNair out to dry for the very same thing, too. Now he seems to be encouraging it. The guy is an absolute idiot.

2326~~~
Can't understand why Vangle didn't start Rojo at CB when he'd have dealt with Rondon much better and that's even without mentioning Blind's absolutely embarrassing performance against Watford and the fact that he's not even a CB. We conceded yet another idiotic goal because of Blind's random brainfarts while marking the opposition's only goal threat. WBA didn't even play with wingers - Dawson was the only "threat" on the left wing, so Blind's lack of pace wouldn't have been exposed and we'd have had Rojo along Smalling to deal with Rondon/crosses.

Why was so important to start Blind at CB? Vangle clearly has favourites in the squad that are immune to any criticism and they cannot be dropped no matter how they perform. Blind is obviously one of them. If the performances meant anything in terms of team selection, Blind wouldn't have started against WBA after the Watford game and Fosu-Mensah/Rojo would have partnered Smalling. Problem is, Vangle seems to think Blind is essential to the way we play and massively overrates his passing ability. He has his moments, but most of the time his passing is shit - resorts to hoofballs, takes forever to release the ball, slips way too much or just gifts the ball to the opposition with a misplaced pass near our box. He's a waste of space at the moment.

2327~~~
I'm still in awe having a centreback take corners. Against counter attacking teams

2328~~~
Still makes more sense then Phil Jones taking corners

2329~~~
he's good at stepping out, reads the game well but over long distance he's just second to Mertefecker

2330~~~
it dosnt really matte if he takes them well and he's got a good technique, apart that there is always a player for him at the back faster able to cut the counter short like Varela

2331~~~
He was playing very well at the star of the season with Damian, Smalling and Shaw. 
Lately, he has been poor. I also think that Memphis or Mata should take the corners.

I would like to see him as midfielder some games and play Rojo as CB.

2332~~~
Mainly due to our system being screwed back so low that it was literally keeping the ball and not creating any chances at all. I think it hid the fact that he's not a very good defender at CB.

2333~~~
Hasn't he played the most minutes for us this season? Guy's dead tired, needs a rest.

2334~~~
Not sure about minutes, but he's started the most games for us this season - currently he has 1 more start then Smalling and 4 more then Mata.

2335~~~
Our best outfield player on a bad night for me.

2336~~~
Dreadful in the first half, okay in the second... so you're probably right.

2337~~~
He at least tried, I'll give him that, looks exhausted though.

2338~~~
Thought he was okay, no major mistakes and did well as LWB, he's probably the best player on the ball in our squad as well.

2339~~~
I dunno, he was crap on the ball today I thought... there might have been less of the hoofs we've been seeing of late, but he had a fair whack of the ball in the second half, and managed to do absolutely nothing with it.

Mind you, in the grand scheme of our performance, I suppose not giving the ball away every time you get it probably is something to be lauded.

2340~~~
At least he managed to beat a defender/put in a cross and some nice clever passes, nobody else in our team seems able to do that. Not that he was really good, just better than the others.

2341~~~
Happy Birthday.

2342~~~
His passing is superb. Should really be playing alongside Schneiderlin in the middle of the park.

2343~~~
we already heard this one about Daley Pirlo/Luka Blind, his passing is superb because he has all the time in the world in defense, he is limited as a midfielder and it's not okay passing which holds him back...

2344~~~
Is his passing actually superb, or the rest of our teams passing well under par? Imo it's the latter but that's just my opinion. I thought Blind actually made a few poor passes tonight. 

However, better performance than his last 2/3.

2345~~~
I think he deserves another run there. He  was still relatively young when he played a lot of games there last season and Carrick got better with age.

2346~~~
I wouldnt mind him in midfield if Schneiderlin, herrera, sweinsteigger are out, he should never start ahead of them though, what he needs now is to be dropped, he's done well for a squad player but should take a rest..

2347~~~
Remember when we used to play defenders in defense ?

Wow, what a cunning concept that was...

2348~~~
I think many over rate him.

2349~~~
no

2350~~~
Don't know if someone noticed but their penalty was his fault. I sometimes stop following the ball in games and concentrate on the movement of players. You can clearly see they get their penalty after Daley surges with the ball at his feet, losses it and then fails to track back. Not only he doesn't track he just sits and watches how Clyne advances with the ball while he's marking no one.

2351~~~
He was our best player apart from De Gea.

2352~~~
He's rotten at the moment but our coach insists on playing him.

2353~~~
Worst player on the pitch atm.

2354~~~
I get a heart attack every time he <i>clears</i> the ball.

2355~~~
Bonkers he wasnt rested at all. No reason why we couldnt play Rojo as CB today and somebody, anybody at LB. Its like the manager is not even watching the game. probably playing his crossword, and is trying to find another word for philosophy for 8 across (and is hoping somebody mentions it).

2356~~~
Winning his headers though, so it's not all bad

2357~~~
Completely lost his man for the free header that was headed straight at de gea.

2358~~~
Whoosh.

2359~~~
Maybe the least talented first choice player we've had in a decade or more.

2360~~~
His corners were particularly rubbish today... But then, our corners are often rubbish (and sometimes outright stupid) regardless of who's taking them.

2361~~~
Played better than against Watford and West Brom, make of that what you will.

2362~~~
Can't do it in games where the opposition makes us defend. Looks nice and tidy passing when they sit back and don't pressure him.

2363~~~
His corners (apart from one) and free kicks were dreadful today.

2364~~~
Should be playing in the midfield

2365~~~
Repeating myself but this guy needs a rest. 44 games this season overall thus far for us, don't know how many for Holland, 3900 minutes for us making it the most minutes out of all players this season for us. I can't be arsed to check all the teams but I wouldn't be surprised he played the most minutes of all outfield players in EPL. No outfield player or goalkeeper for the teams above us + Chelsea + Liverpool played more minutes than him this season in all competitions.

2366~~~
Still not at his best but played better than his last games

2367~~~
He's got too much of a midfielders instinct and gets pulled out too easily.

2368~~~
Never a central defender imo.

2369~~~
So dreadful they decided to take the stupid short ones after a while.

2370~~~
How do you rank Blind as defender, left back and midfielder?

This guy has been made to play far too often this season. I can't remember the last time he didn't play a full 90 minutes for us. Good player but starting to look very burnt out.

2373~~~
He's simply not a CB. Not athletic or strong enough.

2374~~~
He's not a centre back. It's like we're handicapped when defending because of his lack of physicality and pace. Yes he's intelligent and reads the game well, but as a centre back you need some physicality. He's too weak.

2375~~~
At least his passing is back.

2376~~~
If we had 1 or 2 more players who want the ball and utilise it aswell as Blind, we would go far.

2377~~~
Been one of our best players in this match so far.

2378~~~
He needs to play as a DM, CM. Today he has done some great interceptions, he is cool with the ball usually, has stamina, his pace is not great, but not bad either.
I hope the next manager will try Ander and Blind in midfield, rather than continue these ridiculous experiments.

2379~~~
Has had a mixed match, some poor moments but some important interceptions as well.

2380~~~
He's been our best player.

2381~~~
That explains why we're are average

2382~~~
He wasn't too bad tonight, but his positioning is just really weird sometimes. He often stands so much further back than he realistically needs to.

2383~~~
Aye. I think our players have a hell of a lot more to offer, Blind included, our players are mentally broken.

2384~~~
He is really slow. If Origi gets a run on him he is done, or any of the Liverpool forwards for that matter.

2385~~~
Think Blind is a decent squad player at best

2386~~~
True. It's often worrying though because he really leaves himself at risk of playing a player onside when he should ideally be off.

2387~~~
I like him. I think he and Smalling make a decent partnership, the full back positions is where our defence is really poor IMO. Weak wide forwards like Mata and Lingard don't help the right hand side, nor do lazy ones on the left like Memphis. I was actually pleased to see Valencia back in the side, an actual athlete!

2388~~~
I really like him. One of the smartest players in our squad. Played well tonight in my opinion.

2389~~~
Thought he did really well tonight. Made some really good interceptions and read the game well.

2390~~~
One of his problem with is that he is so weak so he always looses the first encounter. So that gives space to the opponent to organise and make a better attack. He is incapable of winning a land or an aerial duel.

2391~~~
Very good save for that ridiculous pass at the end to Origi was it?

2392~~~
I just don't get the hate he gets from some of our fans. He's very good.

2393~~~
He's not good enough to be our starting regular centre back imo

2394~~~
Probably not. He and Smalling have good qualities but both lack significantly in other departments. Like most of our players really.

2395~~~
Agree

2396~~~
He was ok tonight, certainly the best of the back 4, and neither him or Smalling were helped by our AWOL fullbacks and lack of protection from the midfield.

2397~~~
The guy was the Eredeivisie player of the year as a DM, why has he been playing as a makeshift CB, let him play to his strenghts, you dont need speed as a DM, just a good brain, positioning , interceptions etc. And as we can see the guy is a very intelligent player, plus he makes some excellent long passes, probably our most similiar player to carrick imo

2398~~~
I thought he was decent. A bit like Smalling in that they did some good things and some not-so-good things.

2399~~~
I'm surprised he and Carrick don't switch positions. I prefer Carrick at the back and Blind as a DM could work.

2400~~~
You can't play him, Carrick, Fellaini, and Mata in the same side. They must be four of the slowest players in the league.

That said, he deserves his place more than they deserve theirs.

2401~~~
Yeah agree. Given he's not blessed physically he still does quite well at CB. Can only be his intelligence. 

Him and Smalling have been a tidy partnership this season, good enough to be in the top four anyway.

2402~~~
Really? I think Blind is a much better CB. That mistake Carrick made in the first leg was just horrendous for a central defender. Blind has more bottle and gets stuck in too.

2403~~~
I dont think Blind is bad at CB. Just prefer to see him a bit further forward.

2404~~~
Him and Smalling do not communicate at all. Its so much easier to see when youre at the game. They hardly talk, its like they are just told to go out and then end up doing their own thing. Its crazy.

And hes sooo relaxed when he gets the ball at the back. He had a mixed game.

2405~~~
Me too. I loved how he sensed danger after yet another Liverpool break where Smalling was covering the box, I think Origi it was who was running at Valencia and he squared the ball to Coutinho or Firmino and Blind brilliantly came across from virtually an LB position to win the ball. He did have some off moments though, with a couple of wayward passes, but I thought he was good overall. He was basically playing as a deep lying playmaker in the last 30 mins.

And yeah, I agree with whoever suggested that he is a much better CB than Carras.

2406~~~
Partnership? They spend quite a lot of our games defending completely independently to one another...

Might even contribute to the fact that often, when one of them is decent (Blind yesterday) the other is an erratic mess (Smalling yesterday)

Exactly this. Been saying it for ages.

2407~~~
When I've watched us a few times this season I've noticed this for sure. I almost get the feeling that Smalling see's Blind as a baby duckling that he has to babysit all the time. Obviously that is just my speculation from observing though, but the guy is out of position so much. So much so that I cringe sometimes waiting for something bad to happen. I can't imagine having to play next to someone when I don't have a clue what they are going to do and when they are going to do it and thinking that when they do it is going to be something a bit bat shit insane.

I honestly don't understand why he goes running off after the loose ball so much and anticipating play with his positioning. Van Gaal is such an obsessive for positional discipline and how that doesn't make his ass twitch is beyond me.

2408~~~
He's good at reading the game and excellent on the ball.

But he's also not able to defend well when put under pressure, because he isn't a cb. The West Brom goal being a prime example. It doesn't come natural to him because he isn't and never will be a cb, sadly. A shame LVG doesn't see this.

2409~~~
Hes been great for us this season but he looks absolutely nackered now. Desperately needs a couple of weeks off.

2410~~~
I like him but he can't play another season at CB, he goes wandering off round the pitch at too many vital moments.  Smalling needs a sensible partner who is good in the air and a good communicator.

2411~~~
He's a good player, but a rubbish CB. On of the worst decisions LVG has made in the summer was not signing a new CB. 

Also, it feels like LVG always finds a way to squeeze him into the team even when he doesn't deserve to play.

2412~~~
No doubt we're a quiet team but nonetheless they have been a partnership. A decent one at that.

Erratic mess is way over the top.

2413~~~
Not really, Smalling was completely erratic yesterday, as he's been in a couple of games this season, and as Blind was against Watford and West Brom.

2414~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/c6u5" width="560"></iframe>

It's these passages of play where he stands around in the middle of nowhere (around the middle before setting off miles behind Emre Can) that make me cringe.

2415~~~
Looked knackered last night, give the lad a rest. Everything goes through him - if he's that good a playmaker then get him in midfield FFS.

2416~~~
Big fan of Blind, but at centre back he can often looks like one of our best and worst players in the same 90 minutes. Bizarrely, he looked vulnerable before the booking, and after it, all of his tackles were spot on. He went into a few challenges on a booking that made me wince, but he won all of them. Before the booking, he was chopping down anyone who came near him.

His passing is awesome, but sometimes he balloons it to nobody. His positioning and anticipation is often excellent as well, but some times it is a bit "WTF?! Where's Blind?"

Never change, Daley.

2417~~~
I would expect a defender when in a footrace to look towards the other side to see the state of play. When he's turned at no point does he have the big picture, he just runs with his man and he get's megged and they should score. Having said that smalling! For me should have done more for their goal. He defends an area but it's better to block off the threat. So he should have checked where he was and then recognized the threat. He should have attacked the target but he left the young full back exposed. So we can defend better in general. My own feeling is we've gotten away with it. Not that Blind is a poor player but I think he's not good enough for our midfield. He's not good for us as a full back and he's done ok centrally but we need to improve our back line. Our Full back could and maybe should have just dragged him down outside the box and took the booking but oh well.

In the first leg, Carrick should have done as a great defender would have done. Vidic would have just smashed the ball out of play and then regrouped. It's harder to be tidy at the tempo we play, especially as we've not played it all season but it's these little things that are punishing us.

2418~~~
<a class="username" data-user="12228, @Striker10" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12228/">@Striker10</a> I don't think blind is a poor player either. But it has been one of Van Gaal's huge mistakes to play him there because he has cost us points on a couple of occasions. I like Blind as a player but I think he should be a midfielder squaddie and fullback backup.

2419~~~
He's been consistent this season but to be fair the quality he's been showing are average for Manchester United centre back quality. He will be very good for a backup centre back but first choice I have to say meh. He's a weak link in my opinion because his physical isn't for centre back and Smalling has been covering him a lot and trying to win every single headers because he doesn't trust Blind to win it and both of them haven't been showing any good understanding as well. Another reason why Smalling has been caught off out of position a few times this season.

2420~~~
Or you know Smalling's positioning is just a bit shit. But of course that can't be it, all of Smalling's deficiencies are because of Blind. Instead of Smalling needing a better partner, how about Blind get one. Blind gets bitched out for chasing the ball but Smalling does it just as much if not more. Smalling is apparently always bailing out Blind, but yesterday alone Blind bailed Smalling out after yet again running out trying to win balls he had absolutely no chance of winning. Also bailed out Fellaini and Carrick after giving the ball away. But heaven forbid something actually being one man backline Smalling's fault.

2421~~~
Blind was isolated at least 4 times yesterday after giveaways from Fellaini and Carrick and Smalling being dragged all over the place and he dealt with them every time.

2422~~~
On two occasions he was left one on one because of Smalling errors and came up on top. Thought he had a pretty good game yesterday.

2423~~~
What are we actually gaining from playing him at CB? Our attack is absolutely non-existent, with our without a CB who can build up play.

2424~~~
I don't think so, Smalling's positioning had been good last season. The main reason why this season his positioning looked poor because he needs to cover all our back four job. He's doing everything by himself and it's not good when one man needs to do 4 men's job. Another example is when against Chelsea 1-1, he was covering Darmian place is the main reason he was caught off out of position. Even if Blind gets one better than Smalling, let's just say Thiago Silva and he will still need to cover blind's error, blind's physical ability and other defenders job so basically Thiago Silva is still going to do a 4 men's job.

Yesterday Blind had a poor first half, so many errors and he was one of the worst list player on the pitch. Smalling was covering him all the time at first half and I thought Smalling had a solid first half. Second half was the opposite, Smalling made mistakes and Blind did his job good but to be fair second half all the players already lost their spirit and seems like already game over and our players were all over the place like they didn't know what they need to do (headless chicken) so it's not like I expected Liverpool attackers to have many reason to go all out bombering our defense in second half.

2425~~~
I am not sure either, at various times this season when the game has had to be opened up to allow our attack to function he's been found wanting at CB without the extra protection and excessive possession. It in my opinion has been a massive mistake from Van Gaal really. I am not going to hack Blind because I think he's tried his best and his best has been decent enough all-round but some of his mistakes have genuinely cost us points and they were very "midfielder playing like a midfielder but the last line of defense.." type mistakes.

2426~~~
Not quite buying the idea that Smalling should feel like he's babysitting him. On average Blind looks the more assured and tidy centre-back despite the bad performances we've seen. I like Smalling but a lot of folks completely overlooks his shite passing (often hoofing) and plenty of erratic positioning (and badly timed pressing). Too much praise is given to Smalling just because he's quick and can easily outmuscle a lot of forwards (there's more to defending than that).

If it is true that they don't communicate (wouldn't surprise me if it included De Gea too), that is pretty damning on Van Gaal never mind the two players.

2427~~~
Blind is not a PL CB, ever.  He is playing there because the manager wants a left footed player in there as a principle, if we had a 26 year old Rio Ferdinand at the club, Smalling would probably be on the bench to accommodate that principle.

2428~~~
More 1 man backline Smaling. Frankly, this post is full of shite.

2429~~~
sigh.

2430~~~
The amount of people who think think Blind is a competent defender in here is ridiculous. Wouldn't even start on any other PL team. He's a good passer some days when he feels like it. Gets manhandled and beaten with speed most days. Sure he makes some clearances and interceptions. It's kind of supposed to be his job. He's good at reading the game I'll give you that, but in general gives away too many chances to opponents due to his lack of athleticism. 

Smalling covers so much ground defending, challenging aerially, blocking shots, and making last ditch tackles that i think its ridiculous anyone thinks he has a defensive CB partner. More like a midfielder who roams around next to him. If someone had all the time in the world, they could create a whole montage of chances given away due to Blind's poor play. Though i think LVG's crazy man marking defense is stupid and doesn't help Blind. Smalling was pressing all the way into the opposition half leaving a wide gap in the middle.

2431~~~
Has he made 45 appearances this season? Staggering really.

2432~~~
Is Daley Blind the worst corner taker in the history of football? I think a blind paraplegic could take a better corner...if he was purposely trying to feck it up.

He should be fined every time he takes a shit one

2433~~~
At least he's up for the fight today.  Good dual between him and Aguero

2434~~~
Him and smalling outstanding so far

2435~~~
Thought he did well in the first half, it's really not easy to play next to Rojo.

2436~~~
Very great half from him, possibly best half defensively I've seen in sometime.
The Smalling and Blind partnership is really turning in to something.

2437~~~
Loving his fight. Playing like he cares

2438~~~
Blind is my boy idc

2439~~~
He's been left one on one a few times today and against Liverpool and every time he's come up out on top.

2440~~~
This could be the best he's played at CB for us.

2441~~~
What a weird player, top class performance after looking shaky recently.

2442~~~
Still think Blind needs to be in the midfield but he played very well today.

2443~~~
My MOTM, bizzare they gave it to Smalling over him.

2444~~~
For someone who is supposed to be absolutely knackered, top class!

2445~~~
would have given it to demichelis frankly

2446~~~
His corners are shite, get him off them, seriously.

2447~~~
Just got something about him doesn't he?

A penchant for the big games and the big moments.

2448~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he was involved in everything we did today.

2449~~~
Said that he has footballing IQ more then some combined in our squad but looking what he is doing as CB in positional sense...i would go full Gerard Butler in LAC on him.

2450~~~
Was good today, but he should stop taking our corners. Most of them are pathetic.

2451~~~
he played well today. Cant believe there were people saying his positional sense is 0. He knows how to slow down their attacks for smalling or the FBs to get back. and has the ability to intercept passes

2452~~~
He's so much better than Rojo, not sure if he's good enough to be first choice but a quality and mostly reliable player.

2453~~~
Played well today, defensively up against Bony who is a complete donkey he did well, it is a tough matchup 1v1 for him so fair play. Still, positionally he is just so poor and goes running off far to often, a few times on those breaks from City they were getting in behind our line to easily with Blind rushing up to close down Toure and Silva in awkward situations. But we weren't punished thankfully.

2454~~~
My MOTM, he made some excellent interceptions and did really well against Aguero.

2455~~~
It's not poor positioning, it's called high pressing, but it seems our other players dont get what that means. It's important to master that as possession orientated team. But him being the only one who does it makes us quite vulnerable at times.

2456~~~
I don't think his clearances were that great, a far cry from Vidic as he sometimes invites danger but overall a very solid game.

2457~~~
Smalling has started pressing much higher up in the past few months also. Schweinsteiger,Herrera and Schneiderlin usually are aggressive pressers also. The problem with our press is that none of our attackers are particularly good at it, are poor tacklers and don't have the stamina. Plus if Mata plays - then using a high press is useless as he's pretty much a bypass. As you said, it's crucial for a possession based team to have a strong press, a high back line and aggressive CB's. I guess the classic English or Premiership style of play has been a very deep backline traditionally (besides the excellent Arsenal defence of the late 90's) and a lot of people still don't recognise how important it is to dominate a match. 

It's amazing that Blind has apparently no positioning, defensive ability, strength or pace. It should be a miracle he's a professional football!

2458~~~
He's been brilliant. LVGs best signing for us in my eyes.

But my GOD. Stop letting him take corners!

2459~~~
Loved how aggressive and pissed off he got with Aguero.

2460~~~
Unsung hero of the team for me. I think he'll eventually replace Carrick at the base of Midfield, he's such an intelligent player. Think Barca may be sniffing around over the next 12 months. Get the lad a new contract.

2461~~~
Wish we could combine his passing with Smalling.

Also his corners are getting worse. Hes been fully ManUnitedified in terms of that. Seen it happen to Mata, Nani and others. They just hit the first man.

2462~~~
First time he started taking corners, he was taking good ones, but it's just getting worse and worse for some reason.

2463~~~
Every supporter thinks their team are shit at corners, it's as much to do with the players attacking them

2464~~~
Indeed when you cant even get it past the first defender

2465~~~
He'd be a dream signing for Barca - perfect replacement for Mascherano once he departs.

2466~~~
Think Martial has been better but Blind has been a very good signing.
His corners usually fail to beat the first man, bit like Giggs'

2467~~~
Hes really good, best bit of business we've done in a while, fee paid vs output.
Worried he might not be a Mourinho player, small, not physically strong, slow etc.

2468~~~
Best he has played at centre back, city have so much variety in how they can attack and none of it was a problem for him. Think he would be perfect if we played a back 3 and he could step back and forward depending on the situation.

2469~~~
I say it all the time. Half our team likes to press, the other half likes to drop deep. Bastian got killed vs Arsenal, but he was literally pressing on his own for most of that half. Rooney and the rest of guys were happy to let the Arsenal guys stroll.

I see this a lot, but I reckon he more than makes up for it with his aggression. He is usually very intense in the tackle.

2470~~~
Think he'll be fine with Mourinho. He will almost certainly not be a regular starter in defence (don't think Mourinho will favour him at all there), but he's a useful utility player in that he can be played in at least three different positions, and I expect Mourinho will value that to a certain extent.

2471~~~
Played in 46 games already? The new Evra. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2472~~~
Blimey <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2473~~~
Can see Van Gaal putting Borthwick on corner duty as a replacement.

2474~~~
Isn't a high press when the forwards press in the opponents half?.. I hope he isn't doing that.. Lol. Anyhow, Smalling did it a few times to Aguero and I have a feeling it was part of the game plan to not give him any time on the ball.

2475~~~
Not just the forwards, the entire team sort of goes forward and tries to get the ball, block spaces and then continue the attack. Blind has done this at Ajax and at Holland, buts strangely here at United, there's just a few individuals who do it from time to time. A few times he's won the ball in deeper spacer, with less opponents behind the ball, and you're then able to start an attack, but the understanding with other teammates is so poor, that it doesnt work out all the time. We should be capable of it though.

2476~~~
I think you just mean pressing in general. I am not doubting that he makes a lot of decisions to run out of position and try and win the ball/intercept. As I said above a lot of the time he is doing it and leaving acres of space when he doesn't win it and it leaves us exposed. But after I watched the first half it appeared that Smalling was doing a lot of it on Aguero and I didnt watch the first half at the time. Seemed tactical.

2477~~~
People underestimate his potential as a central defender due to his apperance. In England you grow up with defenders looking like Butcher, Pallister and Bruce or more elegant pacey defenders like Rio and Stones (but always big). 

To the average footballsupporter in England it is almost as if it is an unwritten rule; this is how a central defender should look. Blind does not fit the pattern and consequently get critisism easier than others. If he make one mistake everyone lays into him. In my opinion Chris Smalling get so much more slack than Blind.

Daley Blind very rarely cost us goals and even more rarely you see his lack of height/strength or pace let him down. Defending is a brains game, and Blind got more of that than most. This was his first full season as a central defender, and certainly something to build on for him.

2478~~~
dont let the 'sensible' brigade see this. They would swear that they have seen enough to know that he has no positional sense to play as defender, unlike Smalling. In fact he is brainless and shouldnt be a United player at all.

2479~~~
Good post. I'm a bit torn as to whether I want to see Blind at CB next season or not. He does lack the physicality but he's got to be one of the best ball playing CBs in the prem. It's a great quality knowing he will find a man when he heads upfield as opposed to shitting yourself when Smalling does it.

2480~~~
He seemed to love Fabregas, and I think he falls in to all of these as well.

Blind and Morgan could be Mourinho's Cesc and Matic.

2481~~~
With Jose hopefully coming in this summer it will be interesting to see what happens with Blind, he lacks the qualities Mourinho likes in defense and midfield.

2482~~~
It'll be a while before Shaw is ready so I suspect LB would initially be where he'd be deployed

2483~~~
Isn't Shaw expected to play a few games this season? Plus I think CBJ has looked our best LB since Shaw got injured.

2484~~~
I'd be amazed if Shaw is really ready until next year

2485~~~
Yeah, even if he's "fit" I don't think they will risk giving him football without building him up slowly. This season is finished basically, Rojo or CBJ can do the job.

2486~~~
Proper player is our Daley, love his quality and calmness.

2487~~~
Too bad Jones has stopped existing and can't take corners anymore.

2488~~~
He'd be pretty fine as a deep lying play maker next to Schneiderlin/Herrera's mobility and motor. A Blind - Schneiderlin midfield with Herrera playing #10 fits Mourinho's profile perfectly.

2489~~~
I don't think a 3 with so little strength would suit Jose at all, and Blind just doesn't strike me as good enough to be a teams playmaker and main protector of the back 4.

2490~~~
He's magnificent. In every way.

2491~~~
Can't argue with any of that.

2492~~~
Anyone think he should be hitting the gym hard? Look at Silva at City for example, when he joined City he struggled with the strength of defenders but a season or so later he's bulked up and can hold is own.

There's no danger of him losing any pace is there, same goes for Mata

2493~~~
Injured training with Dutch squad.

2494~~~
Oh for feck sake.

2495~~~
Unlike Silva, Blind isn't particularly agile or quick-footed. 
He's already a bit of a heavy-footed trudger as it is. 

Adding weight is hardly going to help him.

2496~~~
<img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2497~~~
Injury not serious, according to Dutch media on Twitter. Will sit out the England game. Might be fit for Everton.

2498~~~
The thing with us is that positive stories never turn out to be true. We probably won't see him for weeks.

2499~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Daley Blind set to captain father's Netherlands side at Wembley</b></span>

2500~~~
Thought he had a good game.

2501~~~
Did hell of a lot better than John Stones <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2502~~~
Their best player again for me. Very calm as always

2503~~~
Dodgy at Vardy's goal, but was very good otherwise. If he was just a bit stronger and faster, he'd defenitely belong to the top defenders in world football.

2504~~~
The best Dutch player currently.

2505~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/q11t" width="560"></iframe>

2506~~~
Can see why he's captain. Ridiculous that Holland's best player is Daley fecking Blind.

2507~~~
Still think he's our best defender and wouldn't be surprised to see our next manager buy someone to partner him at the back rather than replace him.

2508~~~
It's still Arjen Robben to be fair, I think he's on par with Sneijder who's still surprisingly good.

2509~~~
I'm a big fan of Blind, but yeah, he completely switched off for the goal. Just walking and doing nothing.

2510~~~
Class first half, his anticipation was superb on several occasions.

2511~~~
Dealing with Lukaku with ease at the moment.

2512~~~
Baffled as to how this guy still divides opinion. He's quality.

2513~~~
Best outfield player this season

2514~~~
Yup, he's held his ground well against Lukaku, he's even beating him in the air!

2515~~~
Love him. Mugging Lukaku off half the time despite being half his weight, it's hilarious. 

Blind is the sort of footballer we need. 

The idea he couldn't replace Carrick with his intelligence is just absurd.

2516~~~
Really impressed with him so far.

2517~~~
At least we know why he is so slow now. He's been running around with Lukaku in his pocket.

2518~~~
His critics still think he's a defender and judging him on that merit constantly.

Brainwashing philosophy in fullest effect. LvG should work for Intelligence agency.

2519~~~
He needs to take this game to midfield. He can play at the back of the midfield triangle and help out the defenders. That way he could overcome his limitations. He's not a CB but doing an excellent job playing there so far this season

2520~~~
He's done well but it's a matter of time before Lukaku gets him in a bad spot. Lukaku will be very confident of getting the better of him I'm sure

2521~~~
Not a surprise. Half of Caf have still Neanderthal mentality.

2522~~~
Hence the love for Phil Jones despite the clear evidence he'll never be good enough. He flings himself around like a madman so therefore he's great and a promising young centre back.

2523~~~
Coped very well today considering who he's up against, fair play to him.

2524~~~
Or for that matter for Smalling who has been average to not say shit since November but he still is one of the most highly rated player here cause he's tall and strong.

2525~~~
Lukaku is the type of player that will apparently expose Blind for the shit defender he apparently is. Am......

2526~~~
It's nothing to do with any sort of mentality. The reason people have had their doubts about Blind is because he's often poor positionally, struggles to cope against physical/fast players, and often looks a bit out of his depth as a centre-back.

Done very well today though.

2527~~~
He has been our best CB in this season though, despite all those things, and despite that it is his first season here.

People made their decision that Blind is shit as CB in the preseason and there is nothing he can do (bar growing a few inches and adding a few pounds) to change their opinions.

2528~~~
Compared to who though? Which of our centre backs have better positioning? Smalling? Rojo? McNair? Jones? Carrick?

I have no issue wanting a better centre back. I do have an issue with folks who desire the likes of Phil Fecking Jones to replace him (not saying you are one of these).

9/10 times he's performed just as well if not better than Smalling. And the 'struggle against fast/strong striker' thing is genuine meme at this stage, it's just not true (at least he's not on his own at struggling there).

2529~~~
Not at all. Some of his main detractors have praised him when he's played well. And I'd still give the edge to Smalling as our best CB this season, albeit despite his relatively disappointing second half of the season.

2530~~~
Excellent tonight

2531~~~
Smalling has better positioning than him. And I'm not denying that he's our second best centre-back. That wasn't the argument of the post I was responding to though.

2532~~~
Since November there isn't a month that Blind hasn't completely outperformed Smalling.

We'll see what happens in the end of this match. noodlehair will criticize him for sure or passing instead of hoofing the ball.

2533~~~
Noodle's admitted when Blind has actually played well, though, and his criticisms with Blind aren't for passing the ball. I'm not sure I'd agree with the assessment of Blind vs Smalling too: there was a period when they were as poor as each other. Glad they seem to be past that now though.

2534~~~
I'm impressed. Has played well today and improved over the course of the season.

2535~~~
This. I like Smalling but I reckon we could get a ball playing RCB and LCB too. Should speed up our attacks.

2536~~~
Man of the match. Hopefully that puts to bed any final doubts about him playing against big powerful strikers.

2537~~~
MOTM performance, very impressive in completely shutt9ing Lukaku out.

2538~~~
Super. Vastly underrated at centre back. Today, like on other occasions, he has proven that he can mix it with the more physical strikers. Really good performance.

2539~~~
Good performance and unlucky with the injury.

2540~~~
Excellent performance today so I suppose we are going to pretend he has been this good all season, and if you can't see it then you're stuck in the 80's or something

2541~~~
Brilliant performance brains over brawn today and easily MOTM.

2542~~~
Best player in our squad imo. He has his weaknesses but his technique and reading of the play are excellent.

2543~~~
With defenders like Stones and Laporte going for huge amounts, I wonder what should be his price?

2544~~~
One of his best games for a while..

2545~~~
That was a 9/10 performance today!

2546~~~
Nothing unlucky about it, he missed one game this season in all competitions and logged two 90 mins for Netherlands as well. He's massively overworked and needs a breather.

2547~~~
He's a super player. Won't be surprised if he could play CF at a decent level.

2548~~~
Pocketed Lukaku.

2549~~~
Fantastic, I hope the injury isn't serious.

2550~~~
He was excellent today.

2551~~~
So can we now agree that anyone who still doesn't rate Daley Blind is an utter penis? Ok, good. We're still waiting for that big, strong centre forward to bully him, and he's faced a few. He struggles against pace more than strength IMO, but that goes for just about all defenders who don't have pace themselves, of which there are plenty.

Hopefully the injury isn't serious. He didn't go for treatment, and was on the bench as the game finished, so I imagine it was just cramp and tightness.

2552~~~
doesnt matter if he plays well. when he has his next bad game, <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> and <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a> will be here saying that anyone who has seen him play knows he is brainless and how his positioning is poor.

2553~~~
Best player on the pitch today. He seemed to do everything right.

2554~~~
He's been our most consistent outfield performer for a long time now.

2555~~~
You wouldn't have thought that Lukaku would fit in his pocket.

2556~~~
Did great but Lukaku wasn't all that today. We defended quite well. Some people like to judge based on a game. That's fine. He looks more a defender certainly then a midfielder or full back and he's doing well.

2557~~~
He's so cool.

2558~~~
I have 9 posts in this thread. What the feck are you talking about? 

You're so obsessed.

2559~~~
In the top 3 of our best and most consistent players this season,hugely impressed with him.Very good player

2560~~~
He absolutely has criticised his passing a few months back, I remember pulling him up on it.

2561~~~
Excellent performance today, dealt with Lukaku perfectly and it's far from the easiest thing to do. Hopefully the injury isn't serious.

2562~~~
He wasn't bossing Lukaku at all, in fact he got out-muscled by Lukaku but he dealt with Lukaku smartly. Intelligent! Good game today.

2563~~~
I remember you posting that he was the most brainless player you have seen (or something like that) after one of the games.

2564~~~
Lukaku didn't beat him, not once. That's the definition of bossing.

2565~~~
He's a fine player.

2566~~~
Absolute class today.  We should get a CB in the summer to play with Smalling but he is a very intelligent player, very valuable to have.

2567~~~
And every time Lukaku "out-muscled" him Blind still came out on top of him by being a motherfecking boss.

2568~~~
Don't get this, he's been pretty good this season. Who'd you get to replace him? A centerback should be the last player we should buy. We need a creative midfielder, striker, right winger before it.

2569~~~

2570~~~
Yeh but remember guys, he's too slow, too weak and a classified midget. Absolute top class again from blind and I don't think there's anything he can do to win over certain people. If he played for Barca I think people would rate him so much higher and honestly he'd be absolutely brilliant in Barcas back four.

2571~~~
We could still do with a backup, Rojo is shite and Jones is always injured. TFM, Williams, and Axel are all promising but you don't want them as your only backups. I'm looking forward to bringing in a CB and Blind routinely outperforming them.

2572~~~
It depends what kind of bossing you are talking about. I already mentioned, it's about being out-muscled which Lukaku did out-muscled him a lot. It's muscle vs brain. Muscle won but brain did the recover and strike back.

2573~~~
Evertons tactic today was so obvious, get Lukaku to isolate Blind and get your shots off from there,  I was hoping we would have had schneiderlin buzzing around to help but didn't even need him, Blind is just a very very good player. I actually think he assumes a lot of responsibility in the team, he seems one of our most vocal players. Always want him in the team regardless of position.

2574~~~
Do we want to go into possibly 4 competitions (CL or EL) with Smalling, Blind, Rojo, and TFM as our only options?
Yea, this is what I was getting at.  Our viable CB choices are Smalling, Blind, Rojo, and TFM.  TFM looks like a good talent but he's too young and it's starting to look like Rojo doesn't want any part of playing here anymore.  So we basically need at least 2 CBs for next season and you would hope that at least one is top, top quality.  I'm not going to start tossing out names like Ramos, Silva, Godin, etc. (realistic or fantasy) because I'll be virtually slapped.

2575~~~
Excellent performance. Best player on the pitch by a mile, although job was made easier as Lukaku was isolated and there were no runs being made

2576~~~
He'd be perfect for Barca but they can feck off.

2577~~~
He's fecking wonderful.

Danny and Mrs Blind brought the world a masterpiece on 09/03/1990.

2578~~~

2579~~~
he's comfortably our best cb.

2580~~~
Guy's a class act. Comfortably the best player on the pitch.

2581~~~
He has always been an intelligent player. However he has limitations that he can't do much about and gets exposed at times. Today, he was very good.

2582~~~
Blind is everything John Stones aspires to be. He has been fantastic. For me Blind & Martial are Van Gaal's parting gift.

2583~~~
Yep. Only De Gea and Martial have had a better season than him.

2584~~~
He was excellent today.

2585~~~
I once made a statement on the newbies forum, I said that if Blind had pace to burn, he'd be one of the best in his position in the world. He was playing in midfield at that point, I stand by that comment today. 

Positionally and technically he's outstanding, he reads the game and controls the football as good as anyone. He just lacks the pace to be known as top level.

2586~~~
If Smalling had put in the performances Blind has this season the praise would be bonkers. Blind cops shit for not looking like a center back and having no physicality. I think instances like when Lukaku tried to drag him into a physical battle to slip Lennon through on goal and Daley didn't take the bait show that most of the time he doesn't suffer from not being physical.

Also love his attitude. Him, Lingard, Fosu, first 3 future squad players we should hang on to.

2587~~~
Blind at centre back is one of the few good decisions LVG has made in his time here. He's been consistent all season.

2588~~~
People would be happier with him if we signed him as a CB and this was his first season tbh.

He was immense today. One of his best performances this season.

2589~~~
He's played the full 90 minutes (and 120 if you include the Boro League Cup game) in all but 6 games this season. 2 of those he was on the bench, 1 he played 73 minutes, 2 he played 82 minutes and 1 he came on as a sub and played for 26 minutes. So in 41 games this season he played the full game.

His longevity is incredible, good thing he's getting a nice big rest in the summer.

2590~~~
This guy is so intelligent and pivotal in starting our attacks with his passing out from the back.

He's been our best CB this season and that's quite something when you consider the caf experts opinions on him playing CB at the start of the season.

2591~~~
He's ridiculously underrated here. Great performance again.

2592~~~
It's great to see he's finally getting the plaudits he deserves, it's incredible how long a stigma lasts despite hos performances.

2593~~~
I dunno what it is about him, but every time people on here think, he will get embarrassed by the likes of a Lukaku or a big powerful striker, he comes out on top. Lukaku was outhought by the little fella.  It was a fantastic display of one his key strengths; <i>reading the game</i>. He did it beautifully. That interception on Lukaku's back flick to an onrushing Cleverley (I think) was the highlight of his performance.

At the start of the season, I just like many doubted if he could play at CB. Those doubts faded away quickly and I am loving him as our playmaker from the back. Whether he is the natural successor to Carrick or not, I don't know (It depends on whether United buy a CB in the summer), but I am going to enjoy watching him at CB whilst he plays there. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2594~~~
The pace criticism is of course relevant,  but it's incredibly rare to be as good on the ball as Blind and very pacey. The two things just don't go together.

2595~~~
Masterclass yesterday. Distribution was good as well, simply outstanding.

2596~~~
He played well but Masterclass is going a bit far for feck sake.

2597~~~
Him and Smalling both had good seasons but Smalling has edged it for me.

2598~~~
Yeah I can't argue either way, I just felt in these last couple of months Blind has been vital in our best performances.

2599~~~
Yep he has had a couple of howlers as well though the Hull game was mind boggling how bad he was that game. But the lad has had a good season overall. Still think we could improve on him though but a few more positions need sorted out before we get to that imo.

2600~~~
Cool as a cucumber. The more I see of him the more impressed I am.

2601~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Fine, he was class yesterday. Some of us are quite liberal with the words we use you know, don't be so pedantic!

2602~~~
He's had a much better season than John Stones this year who everyone seems to be waxing lyrical about. He's much better in pretty much every none physical sense: his concentration is immensely better, he's better on the ball, he's uses the ball more intelligently, his positioning is better and his passing range is superior.

If he were 6'2" and had never played in midfield in his career, after this season (a couple of games aside) people would be saying he's got a really great career at CB ahead of him.

2603~~~
Just to ensure there is no confusion. When you say he (or shes) being pedantic, are you speaking literally or being liberal? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2604~~~
Credit to LVG as well for believing in him as a centre back. Whatever happens with the manager himself, we've got one of the better CB pairings in the PL. In terms of composure on the ball and distribution from the back, he's right up there.

2605~~~
Love this guy, feel he is a bit wasted at CB. He would be fantastic just in front of the CB's and more able to utilise his fantastic passing range.

2606~~~
Yep. If Barcelona are looking for a defender, then he's absolutely perfect for them tbf. Better than Matheiu, Bartra and Vermaelen IMO.

2607~~~
Liberal <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/> Its a character flaw of mine!

2608~~~
That pass to Martial in the second half was incredible. I'd love to see him back in midfield, too.

2609~~~
Absolutely. He certainly matches Mascherano in most physical senses (possibly a little slower), but surpasses him in most technically aspects.

2610~~~
Was brilliant yesterday, but he did just come off a series of awful performances in the past month or two. Reads the game well though; he'd benefit with a better midfield in front of him (who wouldn't).

2611~~~
Not the only one then....

2612~~~
Probably not.

2613~~~
Madness how his average rating on here is 5.9. Even Schweinsteiger has a 6.2 and Blind has been easily better.

2614~~~
He's had a couple games where he was absolutely terrible but he's also played almost every game the entire season in a position that's new to him. He's largely been very good in what has had to be a very makeshift back four for most of the season. I wouldn't mind at all going in to next season with him and Smalling as our starting center backs. Having the quickness of Shaw beside him well help immensely as well. 

We need better backups though, Jones might as well not exist and Rojo isn't really looking up to it. Leaving him at center back means we definitely need another center mid as well.

2615~~~
Yea I noticed that also, Darmian 5.8, Blind 5.9 on here.
And Darmian has been poor all season bar the first 2-3 games.

2616~~~
It's an odd scenario with Blind. He's had some really good games, like yesterday, he's smooth on the ball, and he makes up for his lack of pace, height and strength with very clever reading of the game.
All that said though, a strong, aerially dominant centre back would still be one of my top 2 or 3 signing choices.

2617~~~
It's amazing to think Stones and Lukaku would go for over £100m if Everton were selling.
If I were their fans I'd very strongly consider binning both off and bringing in 7 or 8 players with good potential for that! Reshape the whole team and squad.

2618~~~
I agree! It always amazes me how people have a fixed idea on how a player of a specific position should be and if those criteria are not met, no amount of good performances would convince them. Before the season started we all heard about how it is a disaster waiting to happen and that we HAD to splash for Otamendi or Benatia before him to stand any chance. Again because those two fit in with the idea of how a defender should look like. Never mind that time and time again Blind does well or that our defensive record is impressive. The other amazing thing is when people bring up games where struggled. If I did not follow any football I'd be inclined to think there are defenders out there who never make mistakes or cost their team goals. "Nah, still not convinced, he's just you know ... not a defender" whatever the hell that means.

2619~~~
Blind has been consistently decent, but not amazing. He's frustrated me a lot this season but overall I'd say it's a good second year for him. I just <i>know</i> we can do better, especially in defense.

I'd love to see him get a few games in a deep midfield position.

Also, where can you see player averages? I'm on my phone

2620~~~
To be fair, at the beginning of the season no one had really seen Blind play at center back other than a handful of times. It looked like a big risk going in to the season with him as a starter and not having proper backup actually has hurt us. Props to LVG on the decision though, Blind has done much better overall than most people probably expected.

2621~~~
I think he has been consistently good with the odd poor game recently. Maybe not amazing but if Smalling is getting a 6.5, Blind should not be getting a 5.9. Blind has played to a much more similar level to Smalling than he has Darmian and Rojo. I also don't agree with this know we can do better. There have been loads of CBs listed off during the last few windows and almost everyone of them who have moved teams has turned out shit. So called 'better' CBs in Otamendi and Mangala haven't been a patch on Blind. Benatia has been shite from what I've heard too.

Player averages are at the top of each player's performance thread or you can go to the match day section and see everyone.

2622~~~
I can't argue with that. It is entirely normal to have reservations about something new. The reasons behind those reservations is what I find wrong. People have a fixed idea on how a defender should look like. I find this wrong as there is no one way for success. Some teams need a traditional defender à la Vidic, some need a different profile like a Piqué or Luiz. The best defenders are the ones best suited for the way their teams play and I felt most of the reservations about Blind was more about how he doesn't fit the imaginary template of how a defender should look like rather than how he fits the way we want to play.

2623~~~
But you forgot the most important thing about being a defender when it comes to those you mention. They look like defenders and have been more associated with the role throughout their career. Who cares if their actual performances are not good eh?

2624~~~
I don't think Blind has been as good as Smalling at all, but I agree he's been much better than Rojo and Darmian. And we could do better, you shouldn't be comparing us to other premier centre backs because frankly the premier league is dog shite at the moment. I want someone to come in next to Smalling who is Barca/Madrid/Bayern/PSG level.

Blind is a good player, yes. I'm happy we've got him, but I wouldn't be surprised if he loses his starting spot in the next year or so.

And cheers but I can't find it on my phone <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> will just have to get my laptop out!

2625~~~
Smalling was better at the start of the season but has been largely below par since the Wolfsburg match and Blind has been easily better during that time despite have a couple poor matches himself. Its been close and is debatable who has been the better of the two.

Benatia is at Bayern and Otamendi and Mangala are both big imports from foreign leagues so it has nothing to do with the PL being shit. PSG also have David Luiz who was constantly criticized while he was at Chelsea. Hummels has had more than his fair share of embarrassing performances over the last two years. And I wouldn't be surprised if we brought a so called Barca/Madrid/Bayern/PSG level CB and Blind outperformed them.

2626~~~
Exactly, there is a huge obsession on here with pace and power no matter what the position is.

2627~~~

2632~~~
But who are these top class ball playing centrebacks out there?  This really isnt an era of great defensive players.

2633~~~
I'm not sure, I didn't suggest anyone but I just pointed out that we shouldn't be happy with Blind in defense. As United fans, we should really expect and want more.

I'd be fine with Blind starting at centre back next season too, but unless he improves I'll still just have that feeling that we could do better.

2634~~~
But that's just it, the quality of defenders right now is relatively poor, what options out there are going to be a significant improvement on Blind?

2635~~~
Again, I don't know. I'm not really suggesting we go and raid Barca/PSG/Madrid etc, but I'm just saying I'm not entirely happy with him being our starting centre back. My opinion could change, after all he has played the most minutes for us this season (I think).

Chris Smalling waxes lyrical about Daley Blind:


<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Chris Smalling has called Daley Blind a “joy to play alongside” and believes his Manchester United defensive partner is confounding the doubters.</b></span>

United have yet to find a way to replicate the dominance enjoyed under Sir Alex Ferguson, with a top-four finish and FA Cup glory the best they can hope for as this topsy-turvy campaign comes to a close.

Louis van Gaal’s men are a work in progress but appear to have found the right formula at the back, with United’s <b>15 clean sheets more than any other Premier League side.</b>

Smalling’s impressive displays have been key to that and earned deserved praise, but regular defensive partner Blind has at times been criticised – something his defensive partner believes is harsh.

<b>“Ever since he joined the club he has rarely been injured,”</b> the England international said.

<b>“He has been able to bang out the games and have a very high consistency. He is a joy to play alongside.</b>

<b>“It is a good partnership. We know we can rely on each other. When there is a situation you don’t have to over cover because you don’t trust your partner.


“We trust each other fully and we bring out the best in each other as the games have gone on and the more games we have played together.


“By each performance he is putting any critics out there to bed. He has been one of the top centre backs this year.


“It is great knowing he is that, obviously (he) is naturally a midfielder so he has that passing range and ability down to a tee and defensively he is very sound as well.


“He brings a lot to our defensive line in being able to play the ball out and cut through teams.


“I think he deserves more plaudits and I think he will get them if he carries on playing the way he is playing.


“Everyone is standing up and taking note that Daley is one of the mainstays of this team and he is keeping us ticking.”</b>

Smalling pointed to Blind’s impressive display in Sunday’s 1-0 win against Everton, when Romelu Lukaku “didn’t get any change from him”.

It was a manful display that allowed United to hold out for a victory that keeps their top-four hopes on track, although making it three successive league wins looks a tough ask at Tottenham next weekend.

“There was a lot of relief,” Smalling said. “It was one where we were hanging on a little bit. Against a good team, one goal is never going to be enough.

“You want teams to slip up but if we are winning our games then we have given ourselves a chance.

“We need to win games. Three points puts pressure on those above. It is a massive game at Spurs now.

“They are playing for a lot and so are we. We have found this season that we have often played better against the top teams and hopefully that continues.”

2638~~~
So why the hell do you keep doing that then?

2639~~~
Can't name 10 defenders who are indisputably better than Blind.

2640~~~
Bar a few poor games, he's excelled this season. I don't even see the big 'gamble' in playing him at the back either, I always thought that before he came here he was a centre half and a midfielder, and the position is not new to him at all. Perhaps I didn't watch enough at Ajax.

2641~~~
You're correct - most of his career at youth level and then the early seasons at Ajax, it seems he primarily played as a LB and as a CB as a secondary position. I think it was only in his very last season he played in midfield and had that breakout impressive season.

2642~~~
He managed out muscle Dier which was surprising, of course he was in that position due to carelessness, I thought he had an average game at best.

2643~~~
Not the best from him today, we could really use a new CB in the summer. I like Blind and see the value in playing him CB in certain games - like Sunderland at home, yeah, play Blind CB by all means. In games when we're almost certainly going to come under sustained spells of pressure then it's not such a good idea.

2644~~~
He's a bit of a lazy fecker isn't he? It's quite often now I've seen him just jog back lazily when he could be putting the attacker under a lot more pressure or trying to follow up a rebound.

2645~~~
absolutely terrible defending for the first goal, whats worse is that he looked like he doesnt even care to get back. WTF did I just see today? Cant wait when one of Tuanzebe/Williams/TFM are ready to play as regular CBs.. They wouldnt have absolutely any problems to catch Alli, or at least to reach out for that pass.. pace is just too important for modern day CBs..

2646~~~
I dont care how many good games he has had at CB, he just has as much bad ones. He isnt a CB for me, period.

2647~~~
Yes, Spurs barely had a look at our goal for 70 mins, but it's clear Blind was crap. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2648~~~
He's got games where he's done exceptionally well, but he's also had loads of moments where he's directly responsible for goals conceded. Those goals conceded are the difference between us being a comfortable top 3 team, and what we are now, a team desperately trying to get in CL places. A good player, yes, but he is not a centre back for a top team.

2649~~~
I have learned that there is no point butting heads with Blind lovers. I take solace in the fact that this experiment with him at CB will end the day VG is fired; which hopefully is at the end of the season at worst. The new manager will most definitely buy a new CB and Blind will used as be a good squad player, as he should be, for a couple of different positions.

2650~~~
Good performance, I thought him and Smalling dealt really well with anything West Ham threw at us in the second half.

2651~~~
So underrated. He's not the most physical on the eye, but he can mix it. Along with Smalling, he dealt with the West Ham attack pretty well.

2652~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he looks a bit stronger and faster?

2653~~~
No, that side of his game seems to be improving. He outmsucled Dier the other day against Spurs.

2654~~~
Did well, apart from the situation with Carroll's header where he lost the duel.

2655~~~
I think generally hes a smart player and you can tell by his positioning at times. I think hes more suited to being a DM cos of his lack of pace where it wont be exploited as much (whereas if he was last man or defender, he doesnt have the same level of protection).

2656~~~
Perhaps, but that comment was still a generalization of his whole season based on the rage after the Spurs loss.

2657~~~
This reminds me of the old hacky stand up bit about the obese person ordering a diet coke with their 2 big macs and large fries or other fatty food, in a bid not to gain weight.

We have 39 goals. Of the top 12, we're 11th in goals, just ahead of Stoke. In the Ferguson era, we'd expect to clear 39 goals by the halfway point of the season, not with 6 games left. And in the CL, we scored 7 goals in 6 games, which is basically the exact same goalscoring rate. 

And look at the table. The top 4 have all scored between 55-60 goals and conceded between 25-33 and <span style="text-decoration: underline">only Spurs have conceded less than we have</span>. Our problem is that we've scored 16 less than any of them. 

Blind has had a few bad games and he's got obvious deficiencies as a CB, but he's mostly had a very good season and formed a nice partnership with Smalling. Certainly good enough for us to have 65 points and be pretty comfortably top 3. 

He should probably be an important squad player getting time at LCB, LB and DM, sure, but he'll probably finish 4th for player of the season voting behind De Gea, Smalling and Martial in some order, right? So I think blaming him is odd.

2658~~~
Good post.

2659~~~
I'm not blaming him. I'm blaming the manager who plays him in centre back and has us scoring so little goals. I think Blind excels in certain areas of being a centre back. That game against Lukaku was a masterclass. 

I just feel that he's not up to the standard of a top Manchester United centre back like Vidic and Rio Ferdinand and it shows from the goals we concede directly as a result of his defending. I swear I've never seen a United goalkeeper who has to make as many saves as David De Gea has to in a single game, let alone a whole season. Just last night, he made at least two game saving saves. Usually you talk of concentrating when you talk about United keepers because they won't be needed as much as most other keepers do but we seem to need De Gea to make a couple of tough saves every other game.

I agree with the bolded bit by the way. In fact, I don't think our opinions are too far apart. I like Blind. I think he's one of the better signings Van Gaal has made. But I just don't think he's quite the standard of Vidic, Stam etc.

2660~~~
On the current team, literally only De Gea is at the level of a prime Stam or Vidic. Even Smalling and Martial fall short. Maybe a healthy Shaw if you're a pro-Shaw extremist, which I sort of am.

2661~~~
It seems the days of players like that are over though. There are none left in the senior game and the kids coming through are all focused on different skillsets. Its pace, game reading ability and passing from the back now. Blind lacks one but makes up for it with the other two in spades.

Its not fair to say De Gea is the only thing keeping us competitive. Its his job to make these saves and there only a handful you wouldnt expect other top keepers to make. We're also rubbish at keeping the ball in our attack, so the defense and GK are facing more attacks than they should. Inevitably some will get through.

2662~~~
What centreback is up to the standard of Vidic or Stam, they just simply do not exist at the moment, measure him against defenders currently playing, not the greats of the past.

2663~~~
Fair enough. Doesn't stop me from getting annoyed at him being responsible for conceding goals like the one we did against Alli last week.

2664~~~
Godin is right there IMO, but for whatever reasons a lot of people don't know that he exists and the rest seem to underrate him. But he is around the same level as the likes of Vidic, Stam, Rio and dare I say Nesta and Cannavaro.

Anyway, I agree with your point and I think that Blind has been done very well. In fact, I have been saying for some time now that he is having a better season than Smalling but cause he's slow and small, people don't rate him. And blame him more than they should. Like in last week when while he had some blame for the goal; his partner was the main culprit by going in no men's land, pushing Blind and losing the header which resulted in goal, but no-one blamed him and instead blamed Blind and Darmian (who btw, had a share of blame especially Darmian).

Our defense hasn't been near as big problem as our attack, although a large part of it is because of De Goat, but all things considering, Blind and Smalling have done a relatively good job.

2665~~~
Needs to be played in midfield his passing is definitely in top 3 in our squad, being wasted in CB

2666~~~
Reads the game so well. That tackle at the end, where he stopped a tap in for Villa was superb. 

I was thinking Van Gaal would rest him today and play him against Palace. Don't think he should rest him against Palace, as they're pretty dangerous going forward and after that is the semi final, so it looks like he'll be playing both.

2667~~~
Good player but we should look for better eventually at centre half.

2668~~~
My MOTM, distributed it well and made a crucial interception near the end.

2669~~~
Good game today. His passing was superb first half.

2670~~~
I'd rather keep him as a starter and upgrade on Smalling. 

One of his crossfield passes to Valencia in the first was a thing of beauty. That's such a huge advantage to trying to play teams on the counter.

If we are to persist with 2 holding midfielders next season, having someone who can play it out from the back like Blind is priceless.

2671~~~
He's the closest you're going to get to a quarter-back in (proper) football.

2672~~~
If only he was so soft

2673~~~
If only we could merge him and Smalling into one player.

2674~~~
Magnificent passing, magnificent performance, magnificent hair.

2675~~~
Good performance, used the ball well and showed some strength shoulder to shoulder when needed.

2676~~~
He was excellent. Outmuscled guys for fun.

2677~~~
It wasn't very convincing when he was looking after much taller Adebayor during set pieces but it was typical Daley Blind performance that enabled clean sheet.

2678~~~
Was good today. He does struggle a bit when facing runners, as if he is a little lost for what to do. Against Adebayor he was plain and simply out paced and wasn't strong enough, which is fair enough. Against Zaha, when Darmian got a yellow card, he looked a little lost as if he should track the runner, not fast enough, or just block his path.

2679~~~
What do people think is Daley's best position?

Before he came to us I thought his best position was LB / LWB although I knew he was a bit of a utility player, however he hardly seems to have been used in these positions.

Last season he played mainly CM and nailed down the position against the odds

In pre-season LVG inexplicably started playing him at CB - and we all scoffed - but he has now played there all season, again nailed down the position against the odds, and is acknowledged as one of our best performers.

2680~~~
CB for me.

2681~~~
I don't think he nailed down a CM slot last season, as soon as he was dropped we went on our best run towards the end of the season.

I think he is a fine CB and a good LB/LWB. Terrible CM in the PL though. He is just too slow and gets overrun easily.

2682~~~
He's turning into a really accomplished centreback.

2683~~~
Sexy bastard for me.

2684~~~
He's a CB and probably better at DM if we gave him some games. I genuinely don't see any reason he can't replace Carrick and I've yet to hear one logical argument (based on facts, not some ambiguous defence like 'Carrick was THE midfield between 2010-13') why he can't.

Ironically, his lack of pace means I don't know why he would ever play LB again.

2685~~~
Im struggling to see this! He cost us goals consistently. Not the worst of our problems and he is a good player but we need better imo.

2686~~~
I don't think he does! I can only think of 2 this season and with that in mind he's been one of the few constants in our team!

2687~~~
Agreed. Too many brainfarts in dangerous positions when under no pressure at all and he can't really recover positionally in this situations because of his lack of pace. Needs to cut this shit out before he could be called an accomplished CB.

Had a similar brainfart against Palace as well, but thankfully we were up against Zaha and Adebayor, who are beyond useless.

2688~~~
What are these consistent goals he's cost us?

2689~~~
Bench. Back up to Shaw and CMs.

2690~~~
I think having Schneiderlin to get about and cover for him would actually make him almost the perfect 2nd holding midfielder in Van Gaal's system tbf. A luxury he didn't have last year.

2691~~~
Blind and Smalling have been two of our best four players this season. 
Unless Woodward can pull someone like Ramos out of his hat, or another part of his anatomy, I would keep Blind at centre back. Shaw's return will help him a lot defensively as he will then have two fast, strong, tall, secure defenders on either side of him.

2692~~~
There is one thing saying we might need upgrade IF there is one in his place and there is another one where you make up stuff to make him look shit.

Blind is like a new Fletcher and countless of those quiet players but who performed up to required standard yet people constantly berate them.

2693~~~
And the CBs. 

I agree, in an ideal world - I thought at the time we were buying him as a very good squad player but LVG loves him.

2694~~~
That was never his fault. He's standing there with nobody within 40 yards of him. Rooney literally runs the other direction away from him, and Schneiderlin retreats behind him expecting Blind to advance with the ball. He could potentially have got it into Mata's feet at 1 point, but he was well marked. The only other option was lumping it forward or forcing a difficult pass into Rashford's feet, and unfortunately he lost it. If the midfield weren't SO FAR away from him and did their jobs receiving the ball it wouldn't have happened. Very easy to just blame Blind directly as he passed the ball, but he really shouldn't have to be trying to fire in such a difficult pass. It's exactly why Rooney will never work as a CM IMO

2695~~~
Recently against Spurs he played a major part in 2 goals we lost of the top of my head. Against Palace he nearly cost us. It's every other game! He is a good player and nice on the ball but an accomplished defender he certainly is not.

2696~~~
Hard to disagree he's had a good season but he is a suspect defender. Given the choice of buying and replacing either Valencia at right back or buying and replacing Blind at centre back I'd buy a centre back. But Blind is a great squad player I just think he's Nicky Butt level or P Neville level type player as in very valuable to the squad but not quite first 11 regulars if we want to be top dogs again. Maybe like Fletcher he will improve again and become one but he has to many major flaws for this ie positional, pace and physicality (he's a bit of a girly). Only the positional he will be able to improve on.

2697~~~
People always talk about him being "great on the ball", but he falters completely when anyone dares to press him. How much important passes does he actually make, that a "normal" CB couldn´t do? He is a decent defender, so there is no point in buying another mediocre player for the sake of it. Still, if our scouts are unable to identify affordable and realistic upgrades for this position, they should get shown the door.

2698~~~
Cost us points against Chelsea with silly defending, lost Rondon against WBA in an almost identical fashion. To me, as someone who thinks he is still a good player despite being quite poor at CB this season, these lapses are almost identical and stem from him being a midfielder and using a midfielders instinct.

The unpredictable nature of when he tries to run out and win a ball has played a part in most of the goals conceded that have cost us. (Also many that have not..) I don't see why he couldn't play in front of the back four and use his pressing ability and his nous for attacking the ball carrier and winning the ball in front of two defenders where he can be bailed out if he fails.

I have a strange sense of déjà vu and that I've had the same conversation about this before.

2699~~~
It's what he does, though. Most of the time it takes him way too much time to make his mind up and he ends up making a mistake in a dangerous position or just hoofs it in no man's land. What makes it even more dangerous is his lack of pace, which prevents him from recovering positionally. We can't just blame the other players' movement every time.

I guess it's an extremely unpopular opinion around here, but I think his passing is overrated. He pulls off some great passes from time to time, but most of the time he's misplacing passes in dangerous positions, hoofs it to no one and tries way too many hollywood passes that are doomed to fail just because he pulled one off against Spain in 2014.

It's not his fault, though. It's clearly due to Van Gaal's instructions and that's why every attack starts with Blind.

2700~~~
Smalling cost us just as many. He was to be blamed for all 3 goals against Newcastle, the first against Wolfsburg, the goal by west ham in the FA cup where he was completely screwed up by letting Carroll (his man) have a free header to lay it off among many and could have cost us more too (vs villa he was wrong footed by ayew twice and required timely intervention from Rojo and Blind to save him).

2701~~~
He's been one of our best players this seasons. He's had some bad games but some beauties too.

Regardless of how high you rate him, he deserves a lot of credit for playing CB and holding his own in England. Especially considering his physical stature  and coming from a the Dutch league.

2702~~~
<a class="username" data-user="100638, @Perrick Dubois" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/100638/">@Perrick Dubois</a> <a class="username" data-user="23979, @Lawman" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23979/">@Lawman</a> pretty much this.

2703~~~
Oh get lost! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Blind is head and shoulders above both of those players, good as they were.

As some have said before, I think Barcelona would love him. He's perfect for them.

2704~~~
You have to be kidding me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Reminds me of those threads, where fans put Darmian/Smalling/Schneiderlin/Mata/Depay in hypothetical combined Barca+United (or United+Bayern) line-ups. Madness.

2705~~~
Pfft, laugh all you want. Plenty on here have said it. He's got all the qualities they like in their centre-backs with their style of play from 2009 onwards.

2706~~~
The same people who said, that Darmian would walk into any team in the world. The same people who thought that Smalling is worldclass. The same people who hyped Januzaj to be the next big thing. The same people who thought that Mata is worldclass. The list goes on and on and on (Jones, Rafael, Depay, Herrera etc.pp)

Barca will never even look at him. It is that simple. He is not a liability, which is quite a compliment considering that he just started to play in this position. I am not worried when he plays as CB (or as LB), but his ability on the ball is vastly overrated and overall he is decent at best.

2707~~~
Although I agree Barca wouldn't be in for him to day his ability on the ball is vastly overrated is nonsense, he is head and shoulders above anyone else in our side with ball at feet, and if we consider him as a centreback, there isn't another with his passing capability.

2708~~~
There was a lot of speculation that they were in for him when we signed him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-set-battle-out-3883039" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-set-battle-out-3883039</a>

2709~~~
Bar getting outmuscled on an occasion by Lukaku at the end of the match, he was very good today.

2710~~~
Agreed, he had a couple of dodgy moments but overall played well.

2711~~~
Surprised more people havent posted in this thread. 

Think hes been one of our most consistent players this season. I like him in our squad. I do wonder what his long term position will be though (will be surprised if its him and Smalling against next season as CBs)

2712~~~
I'd upgrade on Smalling before I'd upgrade on Blind.

2713~~~
He gave away 3 blatant chances! I'm not saying he's not a good player but he's never a top centre back!

2714~~~
If Blind had scored that OG today I can guarantee this thread would be hopping. The guy is just a brilliant player. Ironically the player he's had most trouble with this season is Troy fecking Deeney.

2715~~~
I have to say, Blind has surprised me a bit this season. I thought he'd do just fine against the lesser teams. He's a fairly smart player who reads the game well and can pass out from the back. My fear was that he would get very badly exposed against the top teams - particularly those with big, physical strikers. He's had his fair share of shaky moments, but has been better and more consistent than I expected. I would still like to see us bring in a more accomplished (and natural) central defender, but he should be congratulated for doing a generally good job while playing out of position all season. I consider him to be a very valuable squad player moving forward.

2716~~~
Ah yes, Lawman and his exaggerated chances. It's a little sad your actively trying to find fault in him now.

2717~~~
Not good enough to be a long term solution for us at centre half nevermind fecking Barcelona.

2718~~~
It's funny how people haven't notice trying to isolate him into physical battles don't work because he is more snappy than combative.. 
He hardly challenges aerial balls but it doesn't mean he leaves it uncovered. All season big strong lads haven't been able to get the better of him, maybe we should forget that alleged weakness now.
Don't think he was outstanding today but both him and Smalling were quite solid when need be.

2719~~~
I wish we could merge the two tbh. Would have more a Rio type player then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Does seem the case for some players.

2720~~~
Ivaldo a better team or one in Evertons case (lacking confidence) would have punished us yesterday. Did you not see him lose Lukaku positionaly and physically only for Lukaku (who was out of sorts all game) to head wide from 6-8 yards out? That was the blatant one there were other half incidences that as judging anyone you'd mark him down for them. Or as a coach or manager you'd point out and try and work on them. To have a pop at me personally is a bit poor and not something I'd expect from you because we disagree. So I'll happily leave it at this. I like Blind he's not our biggest problem and has more than earned his place in our squad but unless he cuts out his basic errors and he makes them every other game. Then he needs replaced long term with better quality if we want to be top dogs again.

2721~~~
Not saying they will - but in a team with Barca where they rarely are put under pressure. A player like Blind would be perfect.

2722~~~
100% agree <a class="username" data-user="69879, @ivaldo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69879/">@ivaldo</a>

2723~~~
You said 3 blatant chances, he was beaten hands down on that occasion, what were the other two blatant chances he gave away yesterday?

2724~~~
The best chances were by Smalling. He almost scored two self goals one of which luckily went through his legs.

2725~~~
It's really embarassing how our own fans hold double standards for our players, just because they wrote them off earlier and never want to admit that they were wrong.

2726~~~
When did that happen?

2727~~~
That second one wasn't lucky. Watch it again, he actually shows some clever quick thinking there.

2728~~~
He had no idea what happened. Thankfully neither did lukaku.

2729~~~
He's been really driving us forward today. Great to see that kind of boldness in possession against such a strong team

2730~~~
He's playing somewhere between CB and FC and I like it.

2731~~~
If we buy a CB next season, wouldnt mind him in a DM type position (again). Maybe him behind Herrera and Morgan would be a good thing to try.

2732~~~
Battled hard and looked physically a match for Leicester's grafters. He drove us forward more than our CM's in the second half.

2733~~~
My MOTM today

If Carrick does leave in the summer Blind should definitely take his place in midfield

2734~~~
That's what I've been thinking as well. He clearly has vision, can read the game and has awesome passing accuracy. Let's play with the thought that we got Varane or some other cb that would walk straight into the starting lineup. Wouldn't Blind be a nice deep lying playmaker or something like that?

2735~~~
Don't know. I feel that his ability to affect the game is increased by playing in defence. 

More space to gallop into, more of the pitch in his sight, more players to pass to, the opportunity to choose to speed things up or slow them down, less pressure from opposition.

Whereas in midfield... He has less space to carry the ball into, less of the pitch in his sight, fewer players to pass to, and the speed he'd need to play at (release the ball, turn, dribble) would mostly be dictated by the opposition and not him. 

He benefits from the added time and space in the deep role, in my opinion. 
A good back-up deep lying midfielder, though.

2736~~~
Actually, if you pay attention when he gets pressed, he can pass pretty quick.

There were a few quick passes from him to Depay earlier this season which led to a goal or two. He is capable of passing quick if needed. He could just pass around 5 or 10 yards passes like everyone else quickly. Why can't he with his ability of passing?

It is just that his job in defense is to make sure to open up the other team defense with his long passes and our slow tempo and the other teams camping their half does not help him to do his job quickly. You can only pass forwards if your forwards have spaces and making a run to make things easier.

Even scholes would be a tad shit with the team current style and he even said he would not be able to play. Carrick has been largely shit too this season because he can't use his strongest ability which is forward passing.

2737~~~
The whole system is built around it being the case in my opinion. It would just be moving it into midfield. For what it is worth he is good at harassing the ball and I like that when we aren't in possession but if we are going to continue to amass loads of possession then we have to focus the attack to circulate the ball in the opposition half. I think he could play that QB role in a 4-1-4-1 while in the opponents half (as in, 5 attackers in front of him playing as the QB around the circle) but I am just not really sure how good his all-round game would be from the #6 position.

Nothing I've seen from this season say we shouldn't try it next season but I think we'd have to open the play up a lot more and almost play a 4-3-3 transitioning to 3-5-2 in the opponents half and on the counter, as opposed to a 4-3-3 that turns to 4-5-1 in the opponents half and on the counter. I am not sure which would provide more protection to the defense and if we are still being managed by LVG then you know he'll make decisions based around that.

2738~~~
Also people have to remember that we have no right wing. Blind being left footed would be great to pass into right side channel more. But to who?

2739~~~
I don't really get how the bit in bold disproves anything I said. Being pressed as a defender is different to being pressed as a midfielder. As a defender, the pressing is usually only from one angle, for starters.
Like I also said: He can see more of the pitch. In midfield, he'd have less space, more pressure and less of the pitch to pass, turn, run into.

As for the "He is capable of passing quick if needed. He could just pass around 5 or 10 yards passes like everyone else quickly. Why can't he with his ability of passing?" but...
I'm pretty sure I never said he can't make those passes. Just that he wont affect the game and drive the team forward anything like he currently does from the more comfortable centre back position. He's a bit of a trudger, a bit flat-footed. Playing deeper cancels out some of those negatives quite a bit, because of the added space and time. He can play on his own terms and at his own pace, so to speak.

One thing I disliked about Blind in midfield was how he seemed to demand the ball rolled into his path. And it slowed the game down loads and affected his positioning. He didn't look like one of the elite midfielders, who could/can control the ball under pressure at all heights and speeds.

I don't see what Scholes has got to do with anything. But anyway... Scholes turned miles better with the ball, had a great drop of the shoulder, was a better dribbler, was generally a more agile player with quicker feet, who got the ball out of his feet with more ease. It's night and day. Scholes wouldn't be shit at all. He'd improve the team, not drop closer to their level.

Carrick is like half way between the two (Scholes and Blind), but it's ridiculous to talk about a declining Carrick. He's nearly 35! And I'm not even talking about the current state of the rest of the team. I'm only talking about Blind and his weakness (in my eyes).
They're weaknesses because they're weaknesses, and not because of his team-mates.

2740~~~
I was simply replying to your assumption that Blind would be too slow and need more time to pass in the midfield because he has less space and time. If you didn't mean it, forget about my reply.

But if you did mean it, I explained why he could be tried in midfield again since his passing accuracy and ranges are very good and can beat the pressing.

The scholes you just described was probably 97 - 2004 or so. He had no legs in late 2000 to do half of the things you said regularly. In fact, people complaining about how our mid was getting overrun and couldn't handle of being pressed happened when he was in there.

Carrick is declining on his mobility, not his passing. He still showed it once in awhile when he could find a space ahead of him. He struggle to show it more this season because we can't find much of spaces ahead or not create them enough.

I am not saying Blind is as good as scholes. I am merely pointing out that the tactic we use to play now simply would not suit midfielders whose strengths are mainly passing who usually don't move as much as the likes of fletcher, morgan, ander etc.

2741~~~
Good post - just about my thoughts on Blind in midfield too. However one thing I would add is this is opinion has primarily being developed by him playing in midfield in his first season at United. I would hope that he has gotten used to the pace of the league better now and can actually perform much better than the first season (which admittedly wasn't but, just that it wasn't good either). The other issue could be his tendency to leave a lot of gaps in midfield due to keenness to press too high.

2742~~~
Even Roy Keane would struggle to play behind Di maria and Rooney and ahead of Rojo, Jone, mcnair, smalling switching every other games due to either totally being shit or injuried.

We signed 2nd best DM in EPL and he is hardly pulling up trees even with solid CB pair behind him.

2743~~~
playing in midfield with much less time to act is certainly different to have all the time in the world from a center back position. I kinda got to like him as CB, he offer something from the back but we are never gonna be as solid as if we bought actual defender. Id actually gamble on him next season, he might turn out our Koscielny, cant see getting rid of Jones/Rojo who could somehow staying fit fill in that position as well but Id rather see someone like Tuanzebe to step up, not mentioning Williams, Poole or TFM. We have so many top prospects that we shouldnt kill their potential by buying another "proven" youngster from abroad and a lot of established players yet to step up. Think Bind might benefit from this

2744~~~
I previously believed that we needed to replace Blind at CB but can we sign someone better than him as he has done well this season. His ability to spot a pass is a massive advantage for the team.

2745~~~
He has no brain.

2746~~~
Because smalling left his man and charged up out of random?! LOL

2747~~~
he's quite slow isn't he.

2748~~~
That was definitely on ball-playing voetbal Daley.

2749~~~
Our worst player atm.

2750~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/lyq6" width="560"></iframe>

Dopey fecker. It's not only Carroll that he's playing on-side.

2751~~~
Useless.

2752~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nuff said

2753~~~
He was shocking for the first goal... Lost his man in the box, then made himself really small when closing down and turned his back on the shot.

It's basic defending.

2754~~~
There was a game a while ago where it looked like he was on a one man mission to lose us the game. He's having a good go at it again.

2755~~~
Wait so our defense is almost at the half way line then Smalling just charged up without looking at anyone in less than 1 sec and it is Blind's fault for not being a psychic?

I am confused.

Not to mentioned smalling pressing/closing down a guy who morgan would have covered in their half while leaving his man?

2756~~~
Not to mention Schneiderlin was standing next to the player Smalling was charging at and that Smalling does this continuously. Just a shit show all around, garbage from Blind and Smalling.

2757~~~
It's Smalling showing a lack of football intelligence again. How on earth can people blame Blind for that.

2758~~~
Well no. I mean if smalling had a shout or look at blind and did it, you can blame on blind for not being clever. Smalling just charged up on a guy who he HAD nothing to do with.

If you look at the camera from above in slow motion, blind was ready to play offside on their right winger in case their midfield has a long pass coz he had a look right before the ball was going to come out. 

Smalling charging into THEIR OWN HALF with 2 of our midfielders around to press the guy who he ran into was pretty ridiculous. But somehow, blind is shit and useless and brainless.

2759~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Blind has had an ok season, but today he has been crap

2760~~~
Sorry meant the game as a whole they've both been garbage. On that specific play, yeah I haven't a clue what the feck Smalling is thinking.

2761~~~
If we are losing in a game where we should be winning, it is fair to say all of them are playing crap today.

2762~~~
Blind is just not fast enough to be a top club defender. He's got his moments when he's doing the correct things and he's also quite creative on his day. But he should never ever be in the plans for the future. Transition player.

2763~~~
Daydreaming by playing Antonio onside and then has nerve to put hand up for offside.

2764~~~
I hope LvG take him with him when he goes.

2765~~~
Responsible for another goal conceded. I've said it before and I'll say it again. He's good in one on ones but tends to feck up positionally, surprisingly.

2766~~~
He's played so many people onside this season, when the defence has pushed up. For a manager, who is so attentive to details, it's shambolic

2767~~~
He's just not intelligent enough off the ball.

2768~~~
Really needs to work on that "keeping the defensive line" thing. Even Valencia has learned how to do it more often than not.

2769~~~
Anyone want to guess who was marking Winston Reed?

2770~~~
He's fecking abysmal

2771~~~
Useless. You can get all the fancy stats you want.

He is a useless CB.

2772~~~
oh my god... this guy is lucky we are not in Colombia. he would be gunned down on his way to home.

2773~~~
Well, it's not his fault we've put him there. It's our club that thinks we don't need to buy a proper CB.

2774~~~
Another Nestaesque perfomance

2775~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Did he lose his man at that freekick? When Van Gaal retires in that villa in Portugal, Blind should follow him and play centre back for the local Sunday team there.

2776~~~
His career as centre back will be in question after this game.

2777~~~
Almost rather he goes than Van Gaal at this point. Hopeless player who has no business being in this side.

You could make an argument that he is the ultimate embodiment of Van Gaal's ineptitude.

2778~~~
At fault for all three goals... Because he's not a defender.

2779~~~
He's not a CB... <img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

2780~~~
He could score a hat-trick now and still get a 1 in the ratings from me. I could have played better than him today.

2781~~~
Haven't seen such a bottle job since Jonny Evans fecked us against Everton and City.

 It's Van Gaal's fault too, such a completely pointless decision to make him a full time centre half. His build up play hasn't helped our creativity this season and defensively he's so very mediocre.

2782~~~
It depends on whether you want to prioritise passing ability or defensive ability in your centreback. If it's the the latter, he's well below average for the PL.

2783~~~
Looks like a lost boy tonight.

2784~~~
He'd be found out in any league as CB including Sunday league.

2785~~~
Would fit in perfectly at Barca apparently <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2786~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2787~~~
He's surpassed his shocking performance earlier on in the season. One of the worst defensive performances you'll ever  witness.

2788~~~
Feck off Blind. And some here thought he is better than Smalling.

2789~~~
No idea why he gets so much praise from some on here. He is such an under par CB it's unreal

2790~~~
Watford is the one you're thinking of. That was probably more of his norm, honestly, because it was beside an inexperienced Fosu-Mensah who was doing the clean-up for him.

2791~~~
I suppose it's fitting that in the end, he's the one who cost Van Gaal his precious top four finish.

2792~~~
not a cb

2793~~~
Terrible terrible performance, cost us 2 goals. Very naive of LvG to play him against a team like West ham especially that Fellaini is out.

2794~~~
Yep, it's definitely some fecked up form of poetic justice. It would be beautiful if it weren't so sad.

2795~~~
Another lvg feck up.

2796~~~
His limitations were badly exposed today. Our regular starter needs more size, speed, and power in that position long-term.

2797~~~
He's not abysmal he's just short.

How can anybody attach blame when a big strong centre back beats him in the air.

2798~~~
He was largely at fault for all three goals.

2799~~~
Was height a factor when he played Antonio onside for the equalizer?

2800~~~
And nearly a few more too. How did he stay on the pitch?

2801~~~
Pathetic display. Absolutely pathetic.

2802~~~
I like him a lot as a player but it's hard to not say playing him at CB has cost us the match tonight.

I think if LVG goes Blind will return to being a utility guy being used at CM, LB and maybe CB in an emergency.

2803~~~
He was shocking. A nightmare performance.

He failed to track his man during the 1st goal. His positioning during the Carroll breakaway as well was absolutely putrid. He failed with the offside trap on the 2nd goal. Got beat on the 3rd goal. 

Just terrible.

2804~~~
Tonight's performance by him served as an alarming reminder of why he can't be first choice CB next season. Awful, awful performance tonight in our biggest match of the Premier League season. At fault for all three of West Ham's goal, and should have been at fault for a 4th West Ham goal but he has Andy Carroll to thank for that.

2805~~~
One of the worst performances by a United player ever

2806~~~
A Hat trick of Mistakes <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2807~~~
Obviously not but obviously we're talking about the last goal.

The guy's had a good season given he's been asked to play a new position that he's not physically built for.

2808~~~
Ive said for months he's awful and he is, so what if he can pass a ball he's a terrible defender. If we ever want to become a champion team then players like him should be sold.

2809~~~
I like Blind but think he was the main reason we lost and was really poor. Got totally exposed. Hes not really a CB and that was clear tonight.

2810~~~
That's fine and all that but I remember fergie saying Gneville was a few inches short from becoming a great cb, so he never fecking played him there. That's the whole point he hasn't got the physique to play there and that's down to lvg. Not only that his positional play was abysmal today too.

2811~~~
It's easy to have a good season if you're going to set the bar so low.

2812~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2813~~~
I am blind's supporter but today he is just piss poor,
What was he thinking seriously.

2814~~~
Had a fecking duck egg of a game, looked so flustered most of the time.

2815~~~
That's the one. Pretty impressive for him to surpass such a horrific performance in such a short period of time.

2816~~~
The 2-2 goal was him just being a second late.. The margins are too small in situations like that, also someone in the wall should had to run to contest the cross.  Smalling wasn't himself tonight neither..

2817~~~
Blind is not your man up against a team whipping balls in. Out of his comfort zone.

2818~~~
I'll say it again... he will always struggle to do the things that come naturally to defenders... because he's NOT A FECKING CENTRE BACK.

I hate Van Gaal.

2819~~~
Really, really shit performance from him, and I'm a big fan of him. 

It wasn't as if he was bullied. Infact he dealt with the physical side of West Ham pretty well for the majority of the game. He managed to squeeze away from Carroll's pressure very well a few times. It was his positioning. He's lauded for his intelligence, anticipation and tactical awareness, but he looked dazed tonight, like he was playing at centre back for the first time in his life.

Don't know who could have played in his position instead though, since the squad is tiny and we have somehow gotten away with not buying a centre back since Phil Jones (I'm not counting Rojo has it is clear LvG doesn't and hasn't ever really seen him as a CB) and 3 centre backs have left during that time.

2820~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://imgur.com/gWQwwg3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gWQwwg3</a>

Only player out of place. 

Blind has had a good season, but he's been exposed in every big game of ours this year. There's no way we get back to the top with him as our starting CB next to Smalling.

2821~~~
Not a defender. I repeat myself here every few weeks. Once we get tested, he falls apart.  Doesnt matter how many nice passes he plays, we cant rely on him as a CB. Positionally absolutely shocking, like he forgets that he actually is a CB and just does what he wants out there.

2822~~~
Maybe he just got sick at the thought of Van Gaal getting fourth and surviving that he made sure we lost the game. 

Van Gaal's the problem. He's always been the problem. No point arguing over player performances at this point until the guy gets sacked.

2823~~~
If we weren't a (bad) possession side he'd be exposed several times a game. Awful centre back and mediocre in midfield. He's a £17million backup to Shaw.

2824~~~
Ok if anybody wants to argue about him being a centre back after tonight I think it may send me over the edge. He could have cost us 4-5 goals tonight luckily it was only 3.....

2825~~~
I really didn't think he was that bad in first half. But, in 2nd half...

To be fair though the whole back line seemed fecking shit and made everyone nervous. Smalling was no better.

2826~~~
To blame for the first goal too.

2827~~~
What my friend said

2828~~~
It really takes a special idiot like Van Gaal to have the idea that Daley Blind is a center back. He's not even a defensive midfielder, because he was fecking dreadful when he played there last season for exactly the same reason. So instead he moves him into a position, where positioning is even more critical.

2829~~~
Agree. Centre back is such a specialist position. I remember Keane having a go a few times, just couldn't do it.

2830~~~
Shhhh.....he is our most intelligent player or something.

2831~~~
Shocking performance.

2832~~~
The silver lining here is that The manager next season simply cannot go in with Blind as a first choice CB. 

I'm still furious at him - 17 minutes to defend for your life and he plays everyone on side and then loses his man. Players like Mensah, Varela etc go missing after they've made smaller mistakes.

2833~~~
That's just infuriating. WTF was he thinking?

2834~~~
Hey Sunny Jim thought we had stole it tonight buddy I'm sitting here gutted after that, hope LVG isn't our manager next season I hope he just goes asap he's killing our club.

2835~~~
Off the ball he's one of the stupidest players at the club. Jones gets slated for far less.

2836~~~
I think he's an excellent player, and have no reservations about him playing centre half, but today was shocking. 

The deflection was really unlucky though, was such a nothing goal to concede, De Gea would have had that all day long.

2837~~~
A lot of overreaction here. Yes he was awful tonight and he's not physically built to play centre half, but he's certainly not an awful one. He's generally had a good season and can comfortably play centre back against less physical teams. Picked a bad day to brain fart for 90 minutes though.

2838~~~
Absolutely pathetic. HAd Herrera not been that bad, Blind would have been bearing all the grunt right now. Made far too many mistakes. Should have been closer to Sakho in 1st goal, gave Carroll a free passage which was saved, lost a ridiculous header in 3rd(?) goal. His performance was just slightly better than that vs Pool!! That's how bad I feel he was

2839~~~
Completely agree. He's all over the place and gets away with it thanks to Smalling, de Gea and possession.

2840~~~
No, it wasn't unlucky, his body position was absolutely woeful. He made himself really small and turned his back on the ball... that is NOT how you defend.

2841~~~
He can play centre back against crap teams and when we have 70% possession. He's a fraud.

2842~~~
Same here. I couldnt belive when we scored the second. I thought we would nick it...shame. Yep, i hope LVG goes.

2843~~~
Resting him on the weekend worked a treat.

2844~~~
His lack of positional awareness is laughable. The sooner we sign another CB the better.

2845~~~
That is exactly how I feel, great at building the play, not great at defending.

2846~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/A2tskVI.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/A2tskVI.png"/>

2847~~~
It did at the weekend

2848~~~
The first goal, why is he turning away from it. He just needs to square up and its most likely blocked.
The second goal was frustrating cos he actively chose to drop back and play on about 5 people and then puts his hand up for offside.
Third goal was just bad marking.

but on top of that, some of his passing was really bad today especially first half.

2849~~~
Just not a CB..  Terrible game from him..  Not good enough for utd.   Cost us dearly tonight.  Involved in all goals and gave Carroll a clear chance..

2850~~~
Horrendous.

2851~~~
Smalling was just as bad tonight.

2852~~~
He's fine at CB for home games where we dominate possession. Away from home he's a liability and a blatant target for the opposition.

2853~~~
Yep, but as per everyone will blame Blind alone and say Smalling is a great player.

2854~~~
I must have missed that. I havn´t seen a single impressive pass today.

2855~~~
Smalling was bad (just look at his thread), but come on now... Blind literally cost us 3 goals tonight

2856~~~
Did Rooney really vote for this fraudster as POTY? Our squad is seriously filled with one clown bigger than the other.

2857~~~
You can only do that against the bad teams, west ham pressure way too high up, that's why he offers no advantage against good teams.

2858~~~
Yep and what's the point of putting him on corners?

2859~~~
I don't know why Van Gal did not substitute him in half time. He was clearly having a bad game and was looking very nervous with lots of mistakes.

I remember during Fergie era when he saw a player having a bad game he would substitute him. Many defender examples such as Rafael, Evans, and brown have all been substituted when having a bad game.

2860~~~
Bin Rojo and have Blind as back up to Shaw next season.

Not physical enough for CB or midfield.

Though every man and his dog knew this in August bar LVG.

2861~~~
His passing is probably one of the most overrated things on here. It's ridiculous.

2862~~~
I would rather have Terry in that position than Blind next season.

But i don't blame Blind....he isn't a CB!!!!!!

2863~~~
And not quick enough to be LB. Keep him as a backup DM or get rid. Such limited footballing ability.

2864~~~
West Ham didn't sit back and give him all the time in the world to make those passes. He can only makes those passes under no pressure. That is why anyone who thinks that this guy will work as a holding player in our midfield is living in Lala land.

2865~~~
yeah. it really is. His passing isn´t anything special. Not even against bad teams. He needs way too much time on the ball to make simple passes and is completely useless when anyone dares to press him.
It is similar with Rooney, who needs 10s to make a semi-accurate cross-field floater and the commentators start wanking about it. I must be watching different games at times.
He was terrible the few times he played as DM. Playing him in midfield would be a disaster.

2866~~~
Every once in a while some people think, hey he might actually be a decent CB, good even. Our defensive record is not that bad. No he can't and anybody who things otherwise is kidding themselves except LVG, he is just being ridiculously stupid.
Get him back in he midfield position.

2867~~~
Unfortunately, this is the kind of performance in a big match that I feared we would see from him. He's been quite good for most of the season. In my opinion, he's done an admirable job playing out of position all year. He deserves a lot of credit. He was found out tonight, though. A valuable squad player, but we simply can't go into next season with him as one of our starting centre backs.

2868~~~
My mate was calling for Jones to be brought on and Blind moved to midfield as early as the 20th minute. He was wanting Herrera off. Why Carrick never started only LVG knows.

2869~~~
Yep a lot of his defenders on the cafe gone into hiding. Had a good season but never a centre back he's a chance a game at best. Good squad player at best.

2870~~~
I think he was shit in this match mainly because of lack of communications with other defenders which was very apparent in the game the whole time especially with smalling who as as shit as him and wandering off a lot to confuse the feck out of everyone.

So according to gift lord's pics, first one was deflected and 2nd one was a tad offside?

2871~~~
So where were his critics when he played well? We could do it all day.

And United fans defending their players. What on earth those people doing? Only to get ridicule in opposition team's forums like this right? oh wait...

2872~~~
I really like Blind. I think he's been one of our best players this season. Probably the best after the obvious 3. But he was terrible last night and I feel we have to be careful with playing him at CB up against such tall teams. He can handle one Lukaku but West Ham are just a beastly team overall and it exposed him badly.

2873~~~
I think he is one of those players who is basically an anomoly. The games against big strikers, where you think he would struggle, he manages to do well- Benteke, Lukaku. But when those strikers are running around him- he struggles bad. Its interesting because we regard him as an intelligent layer, someone who reads the game well and hence can position himself so speed factor reduces, but that doesn't happen.

2874~~~
The point being The United we got to be real and defending Blind week after week when yes he does ok but then gives away at least one chance per game is not right. Are you suggesting because he's our player we can't mention or criticise his performances? If that's the case the Rojo thread needs locked.

2875~~~
He had a terrible game, but he's not a center back and did well there overall this season. Question should be asked of the club. It's been over 2 yrs Rio and Vidic left and a club with our resources have been unable to replace them. That's the definition of failure.

2876~~~
You can criticize but calling out and ridiculing the fans who defend their players from mindlessly bashing on their own team forum is pretty shit don't you think?

And blind was not the only one who played like shit today. Smalling was equally bad so it was something else not just individual shit performance randomly.

2877~~~
The first one he ended up 10 yards away from his man (he should know he's the only man in the box for West Ham and go touch tight) the deflection is not the bit I blame him for. The other one he played everyone on as he didn't look (he did it in the first half also and Carroll should have scored. The other one his marker got away from him.

2878~~~
You're talking rubbish if you are trying to put Smalling on par with Blind last night. And stop being a drama queen this is a forum if our player play great then they get the praise if they are poor then they get criticised.

2879~~~
Both he and Herrera had very poor games. Herrera for 5 fouls and piss-poor passing and Blind for crap positioning (but at least he kept the fouls down to just the 1). Herrera, having grown up in Basque country with ETA and all, might have been more upset than most by the sh!t with the bus. Maybe Blind's problem was (in some small way) down to crowd noise (if Smalling and co were actually trying to communicate with him). Would like to see him play DM next season.

2880~~~
Smalling was really bad. He lost almost every duel against Caroll, in the air or on the ground. Watch the match again. Also Caroll's chance in first half was SMALLING fault for pressing their guy in their own half while we had morgan and Rooney around him to do the job. You do know that you can't trap offside in the other team half right? You just don't leave a player next to you and press someone else into the other team half as a defender which is something blind gets ridiculed for.

I am drama queen because I try to give balanced arguments instead of jumping on 'everyone is shit and embarrassing at this club" without actually being reasonable?

Drama queens are the ones who go negative nancy at everything imo.

2881~~~
Blind should have stepped up or they should have as a unit all dropped Blind wasn't even aware what he was doing he switch off! Like he did for the other two goals. You go and watch it again I saw it clearly last night and I don't agree with you about Smalling either so we can leave it at that.

2882~~~
You should look at it not me. Smalling just moved up there without giving a look or a hint of communication at blind within a sec or two and blind was ready to play offside on WHU player on his left who was closer to him than Caroll who was smalling's man and was standing 2 yards ahead of smalling.

Also they were standing very close to the halfway line. So even if blind saw it and had the speed of bolt, all he could do is pretty much running into WHU's half and leaving 2 players behind? And the result will be the same when WHU pass the ball to caroll who was smalling's man. 

You DO NOT leave your man to charge into someone else's half to press someone that you don't need to as a defender. It was pretty dumb move.

2883~~~
He was shit yesterday, his worst game for us, but some of the above posts are just laughable. Still a quality player, just had one of those days.

2884~~~
He has been having 'one of those days' for a few weeks now. It was not just yesterday. The only difference was we got punished for each of his errors while in earlier games he was bailed out by Smalling or one of the full backs.

His biggest asset, his distribution, has gone to shite and all the people claiming his physical presence has been good just got that thrown back in their faces after yesterday's performance. He got bullied time and time again.

2885~~~
Doesn't have the physical attributes to ever be a top centre half but he has done well there overall in tough circumstances this year.

2886~~~
So did Smalling, a player twice his size and is renowned as being a monster air was repeatedly beaten by Carroll, West Ham have been doing it to everyone this season. Our relentless fouling in dangerous areas and our inability to control the game and prevent the service was as much of a problem as struggling to deal with the end threat.

2887~~~
He's just not good enough in the air lads it's as simple as that. West Ham targeted him last night and it was a  simple tactic that worked. Good reader of the game, good on the deck, but he's not built to be a centre half and West Ham exploited that.

2888~~~
Smalling dealt fairly well with Carroll but he cannot deal with every player. He cannot mark all the opponents by himself. That is what Blind is there was and he has been atrocious. He was getting beaten by Reid and the rest regularly.

2889~~~
Yeah he did, Smalling didn't deal with him fairly well at all, they won practically everything yesterday, it was a shit performance all round by everyone but Martial yesterday.

2890~~~
I was amazed at how bad Blind was last night. This season he's done okay, overall, for a midfielder playing as centre back. It's been his reading of the game and positional play that has compensated for other deficiencies, yet all that seemed to be missing yesterday.

Expected him to lose some of the aerial duels, but I didn't for one minute think he would be caught out of position on so many occasions. He very rarely seemed to be in line with the rest of the back four, often playing people onside, and it frankly didn't make any sense. The incident where Carrol ran straight through on goal was incredible, Blind was so much deeper than everybody else that nobody seemed to believe what was happening.

Honestly don't know what happened to him last night. He's not a natural centre back, but he's not that bad a player and yesterday's performance was unusual for a man who's technically quite decent. I was telling myself during the game that maybe the coach incident had played on his mind, but maybe he just bottled it on the night. Either way, that was his worst performance in a United shirt.

2891~~~
Smalling did NOT do well dealing Caroll. Go watch again.  Carroll was holding the ball easily against on the ground and getting other players into the play very well. Also dominating smalling in the air fairly well too.

No one expects smalling to mark everyone. Carroll was his man and if anything, Carroll ownt him as much as a mid table striker would.

2892~~~
I did watch the game live. I don't need to watch it again. Smalling made sure he won a lot of the duels against Carroll but if he has no one to mark the other players, he cannot do it all by himself. Blind was all over the shop yesterday and has been for some time now.

2893~~~
There is no point saying blind was good or bad. We know it.

But point is the defense was a mess and part of the problem was smalling just like blind. It was not like smalling had a decent game. He didn't and far from it. And all I am saying is that it could be why our defense was such a mess on a wrong day. Both made stupid mistakes and didn't even seem like they communicated at all.

When the defense is at fault for not communication, you can never point at one person there. It is a collectively thing.

2894~~~
Both had mistakes but Blind's were the glaring ones which cost us the game. That says it all.

2895~~~
I don't disagree and it was my point in fact.

Smalling's mistakes didn't cost us so he seems like the better one which is true but he didn't have a decent game.

2896~~~
Funnily enough he's been doing exactly that all season.

2897~~~
None in our defense had a decent game. In fact, bar Martial no one wearing that shirt yesterday should be able to look themselves in the mirror and say 'I gave it my all'. However, Blind has been exposed for a while now; only difference is it cost us big time today.

2898~~~
Blind gets exposed once in awhile as much as smalling passing the balls right into the striker and get a counter.

Everyone has a weakness and get exposed from time to time. Depends if you like someone enough to ignore or dislike enough to bash them for every time they do something bad.

2899~~~
Smalling's passing has been horrendous. He seems to have regressed with all the hoofing of late. Yet, he is twice the defender Blind is. Give me two Smallings over two Blinds in defense any day of thw week.

2900~~~
Well when blind does it, it was stupid which is true most of the time.

When smalling does it, it is blind's fault anyway that his man gets free behind him.

2901~~~
You don't need two similar players in a pair of positions.

It is why we call them a pair and a team where one fills up the other's weakness. Blind is not be all end all CB for us. Far from it. But, who else can do better in this team this season and atm? Or how many CB in EPL are doing much better than him?

2902~~~
You don't get the point, do you? I don't want similar players but if given a choice between two Blinds and two Smallings as our CB pairing, I will choose the latter.

2903~~~
CB who won 0 aerial duels in last night's game says it pretty much all. I think anyone who wandered in our box could won at least few. You can't expect good defending from anyone in your team against team that is great at set pieces when you have CB who can't win single aerial battle. But somehow, some say Smalling was equally bad as him, despite Blind being directly involved in all three goals. 

Saying that, I like Blind, he is one of my favourite players in the squad, and I think he should almost always have the place in the team but not neccesarily at CB. He's had a good season overall, better than I expected, but he's had few of performances like last night when you question his ability to even play at this level. What always surprises me is his lack of position awereness, I always think of him as one of our most intelligent players only for him to do few incredibly stupid things even Rojo would be proud off. He did it in midfield too last season at times, it's really weird how his positioning can be terrible for a player who in general shows that he has brains unlike our many other players. If you count top10 worst performances from our players this season, Blind would probably have at least 3 of his there, despite being one of our better players this season.

2904~~~
That goes without saying?

It is not that I didn't get your point. It is that whats the point of it as we will never have to choose two of each?

2905~~~
I hope we get a better partner for Smalling than a makeshift CB. We have regressed in all departments under the prick in charge and I really don't see how Mourinho or anyone will be able to sort it out in a summer.

2906~~~
No idea where to position himself. Slow as feck. Can't win a header to save his life. How the heck is he a starting CB for us. Just because he is able to pass a football?

2907~~~
Where did you get that 0 aerial duels stats?

Also defenders can play bad without conceding a goal. It is just sometimes it does not get punished.

2908~~~
Not sure how we have regressed in defending department? That's with our DMs playing shit and FBs changing every 2 games this season?

2909~~~
Whoscored.

2910~~~
We have defended well when we have had 2 DMs sitting in front of our back 4 with a God in goal, while we sacrifice all our attacking instincts to defend. As soon as we take a lead, I have zero expectations of us holding on to it because we collectively shit ourselves and cannot get out of our own half even against teams like West Ham.

2911~~~
I don't disagree even though if your attack is good enough, your defense don't need to deal with that much pressure which ours have to. So tbh, with that kind of pressure and even with playing 2 DMs who are shit mostly plus FBs changing every 2-3 games, our defense is as good as you will get.

2912~~~
So...

Whoscored gave both of them 6.25. Yeah smalling was so much better.

2913~~~
I don't think this is as good as we will get. I am sure we will see a huge improvement as soon as we have a half decent tactician at the helm.

2914~~~
Well, for this season.

2915~~~
What that has to do with anything I said?

2916~~~
Oh, sry, not directly at you.

Was a general statement.

2917~~~
Whoever was quoted as saying "Three things are certain in life. Death, taxes and Daley Blind losing his man in the box." Was correct. Just excruciating to watch.

2918~~~
Saw the highlights. Had a poor game. Others did too but that doesn't excuse him. Hopefully he gets back to his best for the next game.

2919~~~
got carried away, he should never start for us as CB again, he's just limited as he's as CM and LB, squad player at best him playing the most games in the team just underline the crisis we are in now.. Let's give chance to Axel/Williams in preseason or invest in an actual centre back - Laporte/Stones, if we want to have a playmaker from the back we might as well end up playing mata as CB

2920~~~
Are you serious? Stones has been 100 times worse than blind this season. And please dont give the 'he is playing bad because of  Martinez' crap. For someone who is a CB, he seems to not know the basics of defending

2921~~~
I have great respect for Blind. He's played out of position virtually all season. He's cool under pressure and a clever footballer. But... has rock all pace, height or strength. He has given his all season and I salute him for that. The problem is that he isnt a centre half. This is Manchester United. We shouldnt be having to play someone out of position, certainly not for more than a couple of games. 

If LVG stays does he continue to play Blind at the back? Does he play Blind atall??

2922~~~
Daley 'tactically intelligent' Blind<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2923~~~
John stones is 21 with a good guidance of a manager he can be one of the best CB in the league, the potential is there and he showed that, 100 times worse is just exaggeration, he was fantastic the season before, Martinez is far from ideal to develop such player and that's a fact... Blind on the other hand is 26 and will never develop into top payer whatever position he plays, he's just limited potential.. If we want to play playmaker from CB let's just play Carrick there..

2924~~~
Lets be honest he isn't a center back but has done a good job there. What I don't understand is why he has been played there all season. OR why someone else hasn't been brought in during the summer or January. We have a CB of even Shawcross levels of physical ability and we win yesterday's game. It's just ridiculous, I don't blame Daley I blame Van Gaal for continuously playing him out of position for no reason.

2925~~~
Yeah completely with you.  Blind has played out of opposition all season in the most physical league in the world.  By and large he has done well.  It's clear he is not the solution at CB but he wasn't a problem either.  I think he can replace Carrick next year.  But he got schooled last night and it just shows he can't ever be our first choice centre back next season.

2926~~~
As a defender he is "okay". It also doesn't help that he has played virtually every game of the season. He needs a break.
I'd prefer to see Blind played as a midfielder, though. He's great in that position.

2927~~~
He has been way way worse. he was like the Memphis of Everton's defence. Trying stuff but falling on his back every time. He must have had at least 15 mistakes that led to goals. For someone with world class potential he seems to get worse. 

Plus he is going to cost at least £30m and that's too much for him

2928~~~
He has done a good job overall this year, but I think the manager has to recognize the strengths/limitations of him playing the position.  Games like last night you don't want him in there.

What I think we really need is a high level all-round CB, that we can partner with Smalling when we need to defend and Blind when we need to attack.  Plenty of minutes for all three.

2929~~~
He is English. he is young and doesn't play in the archetypal English CB way. therefore he is special, must be wrapped in cotton wool, and allowed to act the fool on the pitch because me simply must not let a talent like this slip by. Reminds me of Phil Jones

2930~~~
It's not his fault - because he's not a CB - but when LVG leaves I'm optimistic that we'll get back to have 2 defenders in the middle who defend as their priority. Smalling is okay, but hardly dominant in the air, so pairing him with someone who actually is would solve so many of our defensive issues. 

Football really is simple at times - and at present having a short CB with very little leap is resulting in us conceding loads of chances and goals from crosses. Playing a CB at CB would really help. I know that's not clever enough for LVG, but hopefully whoever is next understands.

2931~~~
Dear oh dear you can't be serious Blind was out of position with the full defensive line he had went to sleep (he did it for the 3rd goal also) but carry on and don't let that stop you from absolving him.

2932~~~
He was worse versus Watford Ivaldo but he has had a good season just not a top class centre back long term.

2933~~~
Yep Mata and Herrera needed their backsides kicked for this!

2934~~~
Credit to Blind, hasn't done <i>too </i>much wrong all season. Was quite impressed with his positioning and play under pressure last night, particularly the passage of play where Carroll ended up chopping him down.

If Van Gaal is to stay, then it looks pretty nailed on that if we don't sign a left footed centre back then Blind is staying in that position. I'm not overly concerned with this so long as Smalling can revert back to his early season form.

2935~~~
I think you have misremembered some of the details. You are correct in saying that Smalling shouldn't have been so aggressive in his attempts to get the ball but it is Blind's job to be reading the game and adjusting his position accordingly. He has 3-4 seconds to assess events but rather than pushing up he actually ends up 5 or so yards deeper than he started.  Also, at no point do any of the United defence enter the opposition half during this phase of play, Blind could have played Carroll offside by being virtually level with the lower section of the centre circle. 
Hopefully the following screenshot indicates all the above, it is taken as the ball is played through to Carroll from the half way line..
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/rMlsYPM.jpg?1" src="http://i.imgur.com/rMlsYPM.jpg?1"/> 
I like Blind and feel he has done admirably well at CB this year but on this occasion he was daydreaming and there is no legitimate excuse to be 10 yards behind the next defender.

2936~~~
When blind went charging ahead against Chelsea, it was his mistake for not communicating with CBJ who played Costa offside but when Smalling did that yesterday, it was Blind's fault because he didn't read the game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2937~~~
More than one player can be at fault at the same time you know. Both Smalling and Blind were at fault on this occasion, just because Smalling did something daft doesn't give Blind carte blanche to completely ignore what is going on around him and compound the original error.

2938~~~
He had a bad day at the office last night. Woeful, even. Unfortunate.

2939~~~
Good shout re replacing Carrick, and his experience at CB will only make him a stronger midfielder (I'd like to think), and maybe his lack of pace wont be as big a deal there, especially with his range of passing

So baring any new signing we're looking at Smalling & Jones at CB next season ?

2940~~~
No but it does show double standards. Smalling for some reason gets away with a lot. From what I saw, Smalling didn't defend well at all.

Fwiw I think yday was his mistake but the point is the same people also critiscize blind for the Chelsea goal and then say Smalling was fine last night.

2941~~~
He's largely been excellent for us, just a couple weeks ago he was getting unanimously praised for how he dealt with Lukaku. He isn't a natural center back so he will have off games but that should get better the longer he plays there. 

On a side note, maybe that rest wasn't the best decision after all.

2942~~~
There are plenty of people saying Jones is not the answer.  Personally I think he has regressed and too brittle to be first choice.  Think you will agree we need to buy a CB but as long as it's long someone like Ramos who just used us.  Ed needs to wake up and shake off his galactico mentality.

2943~~~
Lukaku on another day could have scored 5 goals too. I don't see why he gets praised for that.

He's been average or poor at CB. He's a utility player.

2944~~~
He's not alone in that !! <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2945~~~
No one is disputing about Blind being behind.

I was saying about how smalling just charged up without communicating with blind at all. Did you see your own pics? When smalling moved up, blind didn't even see him because he had someone else on his left and his body was directly turning to the left. It was not like he was alone 'daydreaming' like you said. It was miscommunication. But, if you are going to do offside trap, you should be letting the other defenders know somehow and make sure they are aware of it. Basic stuff.

Smalling was almost at the half way line. The question is why on earth smalling pressed the guy on the half way line leaving his main man behind 10 yards while we had 2 players that could do it? He pressed the guy so deep that he left not only blind behind but also 3 other players behinds too. You think it is normal for a CB to do it on half way line? He didn't even get the ball.

What was the purpose of it?

It was DUMB regardless of blind's position. IF blind did it, he should be rightly ridiculed as well.

2946~~~
Read above

2947~~~
We agree fully that Smalling made a daft decision but that doesn't absolve Blind who magnified it by not doing anything to address the clear danger that arose. It could be argued that a natural defender would have been more alive to the danger and actively tried to resolve it regardless of how high in the half the defensive line would have been.

You went a little beyond merely pointing out Smalling's error. You attempted to mitigate Blind's role in the subsequent outcome.

Was he really? And yet he continued to move back towards his own goal and in fact didn't even play this man offside when the pass eventually came.

Is this accurate? As shown in the screenshot, he could have moved a yard or two forward of his starting position and played Carroll offside if he had looked around and seen what was transpiring. It may not have completely resolved the issue but it would have managed the problem better.

I can get another screenshot of him facing play in the intervening time but it would be irrelevant because even though he didn't initially see Smalling run he had a further three seconds to do so and to have his eye off the ball for that long would be hugely concerning, and deserving of criticism, in and of itself.

Smalling instigated the problem, Blind's daydreaming (remember there was three to four seconds for him to react) exacerbated it. Both deserve criticism. Schneiderlin too as he did nothing to stop a man freely running to receive the ball which is what Smalling responded to.

2948~~~
You have to realize though that it was a matter of a few secs in real time. Still pics are all good but the movement within a few secs made a lot of difference.

We have to assume that Blind didn't see it early enough. Otherwise why would a full international put himself in that kind of situation. He himself is a pressing machine sometimes far too much for our liking.

My point here is that our defense was in a messy mainly lack of communication between them. It was obvious in the whole match. And i have no idea why that happened. It didn't help they were equally bad to each other with all the draft decisions and mistakes.

2949~~~
So basically you are wrong? Blinds body shape is wrong and forget what Smalling does rightly or wrongly Blind needs to react and doesn't. We are not talking amateur football here The United. Blind should be in tune and firstly not be way out of position and two react quicker.

2950~~~
What am I wrong with it?

The issue with me is always has been that smalling should know better instead of charging up. It was a dumb move which took everyone from our defense a surprise. Hence, everyone was in awkward positions, not just blind.

You use blind as he should know as this is not amateur football yet it was smalling who started it... But, no, lets blame on blind whose mistake was not to correct smalling's in time like in 3-4 secs..

2951~~~
Just saw a stat that shows we've conceded 21 goals from set pieces this season. We absolutely need an aerial presence at CB next season, and move Blind back as a utility man in CM and LB.

2952~~~
Set pieces defending is about organization as much as aerial presence. We are lacking in both areas massively atm.

2953~~~
Perfectly true, our entire defensive set-up was a shambles and the more I look at the incident the more I see wrong. It doesn't help that our pressing seems to be so erratic, two or three players pushing hard whilst high up the pitch while others further back let men run off them or seem to be occupying redundant space. It is often quite shocking how apparently easy it is for opposition teams to transition to our final third when we struggle to do the same with any sense of haste or incision.

2954~~~
You obviously have no intention of admitting when you are wrong or at best you are not sure of what you are talking about. I'll let it lie and think the former.

2955~~~
Sure.

2956~~~
How many more of these performances will there have to be before people will just accept he isn't very good at all at pretending to be a centreback?

The West Ham game was yet ANOTHER vital game this season which we failed to get the resullt we needed in, due to goals conceded because Bllind can't defend (although granted the whole generallly being awful thing was also a fairly big factor)

It isn't his fault but it's infuriating that so many people just seem to deliberately pretend not to see it.

He is an awful centreback and even his fabled "distribution" is a bit of a myth. Often, he basically plays the same sort of hospital passes Smalling does, except with the added bonus that he runs 40 yards out of position before he plays them.

2957~~~
Blind has done a decent job because he is a decent player who appears to be an excellent professional. He is not top quality though and he is found out on a regular basis. He's a squad player at best and when you have players like him who are guaranteed starters then you will never challenge for the major trophies.

2958~~~
When Blind charged up and missed the ball against Chelsea, costing us a goal, the opposite excuse was used that it wasn't Blind's fault because CBJ should have read Blind's mind and charged up with him.

But when Blind is left saundering around yards behind the rest of the defence, it's someone else's fault for charging off and leaving him. 

This thread is a testament to how dumb this place is sometimes with the player fanism. Peope just invent what they want to have happened to avoid admitting anything they don't like.

2959~~~
Blind has been one of our most consistent and solid performers this season despite being played in an irregular position.

I do hope that we unearth/identify a more natural monster CB for next season but there's definitely a place for Blind in our squad going forward. Whilst not being a revelation, he has been a positive this season in my humble opinion

2960~~~
Had a fairly quiet evening, interested to see what happens with him next season.

2961~~~
Solid game from him, didn't let himself get bullied.

2962~~~
Had that time where he lost the ball to Zaha but he has done that move about 100 times this season with ease so can't fault him for trying, although it is a dangerous game to play. Thought he was pretty good other than that.

2963~~~
Made a few mistakes but played well a typical performance but we need better imo

2964~~~
If it weren't for that brainfart of a turn (no thanks to an atrocious pass from Rooney) he would've been my MOTM.

2965~~~
Surely he is to blame for Smalling getting sent off and for Rojo s injury and for Castle getting cancelled after season 8.

2966~~~
Another player who would struggle to get in a Mourinho squad ? We know he likes the oldschool defenders at the back.

2967~~~
I just never understood why LvG always asked Blind to pick up the big centre forwards, for example he struggled aerially against Wickham today

I'd love to see him in midfield alongside Schneiderlin, he's a very intelligent player but a centre back

2968~~~
He won't be a CB next season. 

Left back or DM.

2969~~~
Shaw is a starter whenever fit and Blind does not have the physical atrributes to be a DM, that was observable when he played there and teams pressed us. Interesting to see where he will fit.

2970~~~
He's an above average DM, and average LB and a below average CB. I'd like to see him given another shot in midfield, though not necessarily as a starter.

2971~~~
What is jose's old school style defender? Like Stones?

2972~~~
Dont see him having a first team spot next season. My verdict is versatile squad player.

2973~~~
Old school? Jesus, he might play Phil Jones.

2974~~~
He likes the (tall) physical defenders. Ramos being an exception at 1.83m but he sure does love to throw a tackle in doesnt he.

At Porto  =Costa and Carvalho
At Chelsea = Terry and Carvalho
At Inter = Samuel and Lucio
At Madrid = Carvalho/Ramos and Pepe.
At Chelsea = Terry and Cahill.

2975~~~
This lad has been almost impeccable at CB this season (West Ham away aside). He's not built to play there, doesn't have the pace either but bloody hell he reads the game so well and has a humdinger of a left peg. Think it's pretty lazy and tired to say he doesn't deserve or won't be a fixture here in the future. He's been one of the shining lights this season IMO.

2976~~~
First player off the teamsheet under Mourinho.

2977~~~
Would be a huge shame if that's the case. He has a very solid argument for being our best outfield player this season not called Anthony.

2978~~~
The big centre forwards pick Blind, not the other way around.

2979~~~
Agreed, but Jose likes his big, strong, powerful centre backs. Which Blind isn't.

2980~~~
Actually, even so, blind generally does well against them.

Meanwhile, the likes of smalling who is big himself struggles sometimes which is funny.

Not saying blind can handle every one and smalling is shit. I am saying it is not be all end all. You need a bit of balance and common sense in football to do well generally.

2981~~~
He should defo remain in the squad. And I think he should play CB against "lower" teams who will most likely park the bus against us especially at OT where we will get more possession. Otherwise I can see him rotating in DM position (esp if we play 2 holding).

2982~~~
midf.

2983~~~
Decent enough performance. Except he'll be a versatile squad player next season, and a handy one at that.

2984~~~
His position is one of the biggest question marks for next season I think. Over the course of the season he has done a very good job at CB overall, but you do still feel it's not his natural position and he doesn't seem like a Mourinho defender. It depends on signings, but I could see him still playing there next season. If not, I do hope he still has a place in the team and I think he can definitely play well for us in midfield. I'd hate to see him marginalised, because I think he's been one of our best players over the last two seasons

2985~~~
I don't know how Mourinho is going to replace him, there's no one player he could definitely bring in to slot into the CB position. I think it's more likely Jose will whip Schneiderlin into shape in the CM role. If we can find a CB with Carrick inevitably retiring Blind could move forward to play that role.

2986~~~
I think he'll settle into one of those squad player roles where he still plays almost every game, but isn't the very best in a single position. Such an intelligent player that he will be on the pitch more often then not because of the versatility and all the qualities he has.

2987~~~
Yes.

He isn't great in exactly one position,but too good a football brain to leave out completely.

2988~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> definitely another pair of caked 'loons after he gave the ball to Zaha.

I for one am glad this experiment is finally at an end. There is no way a new manager coming in will play him at CB ever again without it being a last resort. It has been a horrible experience watching him this season. He's tried his best and I credit him for that.

2989~~~
I think he has played more games than anyone else this season which is funny as after Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger were signed a lot of people predicted he would barely get a game.

2990~~~
What?!

2991~~~
He barely got a game in the midfield, if any. That is what people predicted.

2992~~~
It is pretty straight forward. My experience watching him play as a CB this season has been a horrible one and I'd rather not go through it again.

2993~~~
Ah I see.

2994~~~
Our best CB this season.

2995~~~
I think he did very well again in the final - especially as he, along with many others, was played out of position. Hopefully LVG goes and the new manager stops with the square pegs into round holes bs. I do hope we get to see him back in midfield next season. He has shown though that he can do a much better job filling in at CB than Carrick ever did.

2996~~~
So what if jose keep him there next season?

Would it make blind 'good'? 
or
Would it make jose 'bad'?

I am excited to find out. Dam new season can't come faster!

2997~~~
He was naff again yesterday. Stupid moment that should have cost us a goal, countless times he wandered off out of  position and someone else had to cover. Bafflingly large number of times he got sucked into challlenging for a ball with Wickham despite having zero chance of winning it. Can someone explain what it is he actually did well?

One thing that's really started to annoy me with him is when he picks up the ball, strolls slowly about 40 yards out of position with it, then just plays a hospital pass to someone next to him. Please can someone explain to me as well what goes through his head for him to think this isn't a stupid thing to do?...because he does it multiple times a game and it achieves nothing aside from allowing the opposition to counter attack.

If he had any functioning braincells he'd actually be a really useful player...but he just chases the ball with no regard for the situation or anything else that's going on, and when he has the ball he seems to completely forget what position he's playing in and often either plays a hosptial pass or just lofts it up the pitch to no one. One of his strengths is supposedly his distribution yet he must be among the worst in our team for using the ball poorly or taking too long with it.

I know people on here like him but if I was manager the very first thing I'd do is make sure he wasn't played at centreback anymore, under pretty much any circumstance. There's definitely another case of the Kagawa/Mata effect on here where people will just invent another version of reality so they can pretend he played well. If you take him out of the team and put a competent centreback in his place this season, we'd be comfortably in the top four, and would have gotten through the CL group stages.

People that come out with crap like "He's been our best centreback this year" I dunno. They either say it because they have no idea how a game of football works, or because they think saying it makes them sound clever and like they know more about football than anyone else...probably the same people who used to keep tellling us all LVG was a tactical genius who could not be questioned.

2998~~~
He isn't a CB but I thought he did well. Made some (3) good tackles. 83% pass completion.

2999~~~
It could just be that you are wrong

3000~~~
You sure you are not just writing lots of craps so that you think saying them make you sound clever and like you know more about football than anyone else?

Just curious.

3001~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> well, for one he didn't get a stupid red card.

3002~~~
Interesting to see what his role will be next season. Don't think he'll ever step near CB again with Mourinho as manager. Backup LB and backup DM, for me.

3003~~~
Been our best centre back and by far my favourite player for us this season. I'm confident that no matter what happens next season he will be in the team somewhere he is too good to leave out. The only thing he is lacking in is pace but many players have made excellent careers without having a lot of pace.

3004~~~
He will be one of a few players who'll look back on the season, and think about what-ifs.

3005~~~
He could do well as the deep lying playmaker under Mourinho but I think Jose will approach him with his mind already made up, like he did with Mata.

3006~~~
I think Mourinho might use him, he loves versatile players and Blind as versatile as it gets. Even if he will not play as much, he is definitely a player one would want in the team.
I think Mournho might return Blind to midfield which is most welcome, since while he did good job at defence overall this year, he is simply not a CB.

3007~~~
I think Blind will continue as a CB, and we will sign a partner for him. Smalling will be the one benched.

Mourinho was fuming before about how many touches it took for Matic to control a ball, Smalling is far worse than that.

We will build a solid base in front the defence (i.e. two defensive midfielders + Rooney), and Blind will continue as someone who can start attacks from deep.

3008~~~
We're so happy you're hear to educate us.

3009~~~
He'll rightly take his place as a good utility player/sub/backup, hopefully.

3010~~~
I've a funny feeling Mourinho won't fancy either at centerback, Smalling is far too dopey to be depended on and Blind's positioning is very suspect at times.

3011~~~
Absolutely no chance. Agree on the Smalling part though, his technical deficiencies will astound Mourinho and I expect him to be replaced eventually.

3012~~~
He also loses more than a half of his aerial duels (which is a disastrous stat, really - especially for a centre back)

3013~~~
I can't remember ever conceding a header because Blind lost a header.

3014~~~
Not sure Mourinho will fancy him as a CB or a LB, he might get a stint in the CDM position though. I wonder if this year as a CB will help him in the future, he's certainly become tougher than he was the first year.

Perhaps it might be worth selling him to Barcelona instead, he would do a brilliant job in spain.

3015~~~
Well, then I fear for your memory.
The third West Ham goal is a header with Blind losing the aerial duel. And the second one, while not technically being a lost header, because he didn't jump, is still partly his fault - he was on the way of the cross and should've cleared it (or, at least, make an attempt), which he didn't because he lacks in this particular department.

3016~~~
That was more down to shocking organisation than anything else. Nobody in the defence knew what their jobs were and it showed. 
The fact that people can only point to one match also suggests he's a Much better centre back than people think on here.

3017~~~
That's not the only one, that's the last one. I won't bother looking further back though, you'll just change your statement again

3018~~~
Daley Blind was superb this season (I've argued before that he was at least equal to Martial for me as our best outfield player).

If Jose dumps him into bench fodder it will be a big loss for our first team. He's a wonderful footballer and comfortably our most underrated player.

3019~~~
When did I change my statement. I think Blind is a really good centre back and is better in the air than he's made out. There's no need to start accusing me of changing anything because I disagree with you mate

3020~~~
What he lacks in defensive ability, he makes up for with the lustrousness of his hair.

3021~~~
I must be missing something about Blind reading these comments? I would keep him as he is versatile, but very much a jack of all trades master of none for me. And our best player and keep him at centre back? I am baffled, for me he is an average centre back with no pace, that cant defend crosses, flick ons or through balls.
So many of the goals we have conceded this season it is Blind that is the marker of the goal scorer. Smalling has at last showed signs of being a proper centre back this season forgetting the last 6 weeks where he has been awful, but no way I would bench him for Blind, what is the point of a ball playing centre back that cant actually defend?.....Ok Ronald Koeman wasnt bad <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3022~~~
Could he maybe be the Carrick replacement we're crying out for. I say give him a crack at pulling the strings from deep and surround him with energy such as:

Alas, it leaves no room for Rooney. Still I'd like to see it.

3023~~~
I think we should have played with that midfield, it looks balanced. I can see Mourinho buying one midfielder.

Do you think Mourinho is going to play 433 instead of 4231?

3024~~~
The crazy thing is we've seen Smalling run effortlessly from deep, glide past several players then pass to no one/make a shit pass and on other occasions, have the absolute skill/balls to take a high ball from the air, whilst under pressure with a first touch and proceed forward like he meant it (and he definitely did).

It's about confidence and mentality. Will he be trusted to pass out from the back and do Lucio/Silva-esque dribbles from deep? Will he be trusted or trust himself to always make the right decisions? 

Ultimately no imo but he can definitely improve on it.

3025~~~
Actually think our squad is more geared for 433 but no I expect 4231 meaning a new number 10 is probably on the cards.

3026~~~
Relax about the <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> post, just to put it into perspective for you, he's also said Blind isn't a very good passer. Shows how seriously you can take his posts about DB, for some reason he's desperate for him to fail.

3027~~~
I think of all our regulars this season, Blind along with Lingard will suffer the most(in terms of no. of minutes hey get), more than Mata I feel. In Lingard's case it is obvious- he is not that great to be a regular. In Blind's case- its simply that he has bad days too often. Although, Should Smalling continue his 2016 form, he may be able to push him out of the side if the CB we buy is a physical beast

3028~~~
Thinking somewhere a little outside the box, I'd like to see him as a pressing player playing between AM and DM. Winning the ball around the middle of the park and quickly getting it forward. He has a good engine and he loves chasing the ball, I don't really want him playing in an anchor role mainly because of this. He gets a lot more protection from that position from having two CB's behind him. (This season he's been out of position loads of time and had licence to be miles out of position constantly which has triggered me out of existence all season.) Playing CB he's gone ball chasing or wandering off into no mans land in and around the box a few times and it has really cost us.

I think he could be a similar player to Herrera, but on the offensive end I think Herrera has more in his locker. Blind on the defensive and pressing end, more in his.

I see you haven't changed from when you said this a month ago. We shall see, in my personal opinion you'd have to be laying firmly in the chaise lounge to want to pursue Blind at CB next season.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OH35aM3MIp4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

edit: I suppose he won that header but a proper commanding CB heads that out onto the 14th green of the Sinfin Golf course. Though above, rightfully pointed out his horrifying display in the West Ham game.

3029~~~
I wouldn't see it as fodder, I'd see it as having someone useful on the bench, which is something we've massively lacked for years and need to improve (this would happen naturally if we improve certain positions and push those existing players on to the bench).  There's a lot of positions we can improve and Blind plays in two of those (CB and midfield).  We can get better than him in both those positions, but he'd be excellent cover to change things up or if someone gets injured/needs resting.

3030~~~
Is he not the most obvious replacement for Carrrick in midfield? Intelligent, good awareness, strong passer and seems to read the game very well. Surely playing just in front of the back four would be his optimal role in the team. Why persist with a 35 year old who's best days are well and truly behind him when we have someone who can fill the same role.

3031~~~
Blind has a good first touch and reads the game very well. This makes up for the lack of pace but he isn't a Mourinho player. He's certainly not a centre back. I think he'll stay as long as he's happy being a squad player

3032~~~
Hopefully we buy a proper CB now, no more of these silly experiments playing players out of position. He can stay as a backup/rotation CM/LB.

3033~~~
Mourinho has been quoted saying he likes 5 players over 6 foot or else you dead on set pieces.

I'm glad the experiment is over. Hopefully we don't waste big money on Stones though.

3034~~~
Criticizes Blind for ball chasing and losing headers and posts a video of Blind winning a header and Smalling floating around chasing a ball he has 0% of getting leaving a gaping hole for Thorne to run straight through. Fantastic work.

3035~~~
Really? How about 3-rd WH goal? That was like just maybe two weeks ago. And 2-nd goal was also Blind's fault, but that more to do with his shity positioning.

3036~~~
It'd be really unproductive. He's like a taller, slightly more physical version of Blind.

3037~~~
Really dont get people saying that. Its a myth imo
Carvalho wasn't even vaguely close to being a big, strong, powerful centre back
Samuel was fairly meaty but i was under the impression most people regarded him as a good player because of his use of the ball more than being a traditional lump of a defender.
Ramos isn't a big, strong, powerful centre back and neither is stones.

Think its probably likely he'll be moved back to midfield 
but he wont be getting replaced by Huth or that type of player.

3038~~~
Blind was ok but all in all, not good enough. Too often he was making mistakes and was a reason our defense fell apart once the other team started pressing properly

3039~~~
Big may not be the right word. Strong, powerful is still true though. Replace big for athletic and it's closer to truth. 

Ramos, Carvalho, Samuel insert former Mourinho any CB here may not be big strong powerful as in traditional English hard man standard. But if they are strong, powerful, athletic nevertheless to Blind.  

Blind is not powerful athletic, strong in term of CB. Bottom line: can't see Blind as CB under Mourinho.

3040~~~
Carvalho was still none of them though. He was quick i guess
I dont think its the first thing he looks for in a defender, I dont think its <i>that</i> important to him at all tbh.

3041~~~
I disagree. Carvalho is what David Luiz was likened to at younger age by the Latin/Hispanic football culture. Here in the good way that Carvalho is athletic, strong, and powerful bar physique disadvantage. With Carvalho there were dominant performance like David Luiz on song, not just dominant in and around the box. Was statistically one of the best tackler for few years. He played a more active destroying role than John last ditch tackler Terry as I recall.

3042~~~
He might have been aggressive and a good tackler but he was never particularly strong or quick.

3043~~~
I thought he was deceptively quick tbh.
But yeah, tenacious and clever more than strong would be how i'd describe him

3044~~~
Doomed..

3045~~~
He's certainly not slow, when he does have the pace of someone like Smalling.

3046~~~
Fully agreed.

3047~~~
Nailed it.

A lot of us were worried as anything seeing him line up at centre back, but he was much better than expected.

You need good strength and height in your team in the Premier league though, and we found ourselves ridiculously short of it at times, especially when Fellaini was out.
Need at least 2 dominant headers alongside Smalling, certainly 1 centre back.
Maybe Ibra could also come back if he signed. I'm suggesting that completely on his strength and height, no idea if he is good in the air

Thinking back to when Arsenal had Campbell, Vieira and Henry, and when Chelsea had a wealth of height and strength in their lineups.
It helps!

3048~~~
It's hard to argue for a defender who was now on decline and got forgotten now.
The run at 5:25 in the below video. That's quick run for a CB.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7k-C2oUrXQw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I can't find a good video but there numerous time Carvalho won foot race against relative quick players. One notable moment where he covered plenty of space in a quick manner and tackled Andy Johnson (Everton) cleanly and saved Terry slow ass.

Against us, Carvalho usually marked Ronaldo. Ronaldo have both speed and strength. A tradition strong, big but slower CB would find it hard to mark Ronaldo due to his movement and quickness. Yet Ronaldo only scored against Chelsea in that CL game where he was marked by Essien.

It's better to ask Chelsea fans, but in my assessment, Carvalho was as strong as Jagelska. That's not impressively powerhouse strength, but they're still very strong compared to former and current weaker CB Heinze, Demichelis, Hummel, Pique,... Also remember someone like Jagelska or Ron Vlaar were recorded at times to be among the quickest CBs in real matches while they look very slow. So it's very deceptive to judge a CB's pace.

Edit: Just saw your post where you think when strong and quick standard is defined by Smalling standard. Smalling is very quick (rumor to be quicker than prime Rio) and very strong defender (as strong as Vidic. Smalling doesn't use his body as well as Vidic but on sheer strength he is up there). He is physical beast. Not a average standard for regular CB. If Smalling is the physical standard for CB then there are not enough real CBs at top level in the world. We're discussing Mourinho's cut line for CB strength and quickness, which sees Carvalho, Ramos, Samuel meets or above the average. Blind is below the average for all those categories.

3049~~~
Well i think he was quite fast so, dont need to convince me on that. I think he used his strength well too - tenacious and clever.
The leagues i've spent any time watching are the premier league, serie a in the 90's and a bit of the bundesliga 
so maybe i have a higher standard of strong than most, as all have or had a lot of really tough cb's and carvalho just doesn't figure for me in that regard.

And of Mourinho's first choice defenders he was the only one he actually bought (maybe not with porto?), he usually made do with what was available. 
Lucio and Samuel are a good example - solid pro's with a mixed career who he got great form from.
I think whoever he plays there we'll be solid, even if he leaves it alone and keeps blind and smalling. 
I honestly have 0 worries about the defensive side of our game going forward regardless though.
Whatever about the other guarantee's mourinho may or may not bring, a solid defence is surely still a banker.

3050~~~
Oh I'm not saying Carvalho was weak or slow by any means, but at the highest standard he would'nt be defined as a fast centreback or a strong one. My point being is if these were must have assets for a Mourinho CB then he would've never opted for Carvalho. For me by far his greatest asset was his intelligence, his ability to read the game and react accordingly.

3051~~~
Fair point. I do agree with you here. He is not on the high end of strength and quickness for CB. His great attribution is great anticipation of situation/ reading game.

I tried to convey the idea that Blind could even be put into the same not too impressively strong/ fast categories with Carvalho, Ramos, Samuel. I don't see Blind as Mourinho's CB.

3052~~~
I'm a big fan of Blind. I'd say he's one of LvG's best signings. Incredibly dependable, never gets injured, versatile and is a very well rounded and intelligent footballer. That said, I think he probably knows he might be first on the chopping block under Mourinho, and his comments on the sacking of LvG speak volumes in that regard:

Probably best we don't predict what Mourinho is going to do with what is already here, because we collectively got it all wrong over LvG's plans. We were all expecting RVP to get the armband, with Rooney and Fellaini punted out before even kicking a ball under his rule. However, I struggle to see Blind in a Mourinho team. I can't think of anyone similar in previous Mourinho teams (correct me if I am wrong there). He might keep him as a squad player to cover left back, central/defensive midfield and perhaps even centre back, as he is certainly a great option to have in that respect. I just don't see him as a starter in a tough, counter attacking set up. 

I think he has the quality to play in a few positions, but I predict Mourinho will want someone a little quicker and more physically imposing. Whether he wants to be a rotation option is another thing. Mourinho's rotation is quite minimal, and whilst he might not be a Mourinho player, he's a very good footballer who could be an important starter for a lot of clubs. I'd be a little sad to see him go, but I wouldn't be surprised if Mourinho doesn't fancy him.

3053~~~
Think Mourinho will really like him at left back. Maybe even over Luke Shaw.

3054~~~
You reckon? As a pure defender, I think Shaw is just as good as Blind. Both good tacklers and both reasonable - not great - in the air. Shaw's passing is perhaps not as good, but he's a good dribbler with searing pace. I think Shaw has more to offer a counter attacking approach than Blind.

I do hope Mourinho does get the best out of Blind somehow. I wouldn't like to see him go, especially not to another Premier League side.

3055~~~
Why?  He's a great squad player who can put in good performances in three different positions (four if you include left wing back)

3056~~~
Mourinho will like Blind i think he's a good dependable versatile player, but just not at CB. 

He's a great utility player, lets use him as such and buy a proper Centre Back who can fecking head a ball.

One definite plus of Van Gaal no longer being our manager is that we might actually line up with a back four comprising four actual defenders in their proper positions. I don't think we did that once this season.

3057~~~
Doubt it.

Mourinho likes 5 players to be over 6 foot. Mourinho wanted Shaw at Chelsea.

3058~~~
I'd agree. I'd be shocked if Mourinho continues to play him alongside Smalling, but Blind definitely could be useful for us as a squad player and hopefully Mourinho will see that.

3059~~~
I like Blind, but I reckon for Mourinho he'll be the 12th man on the team sheet, 1st on the bench. Dependable, reliably injury free, can be stuck in to plug a gap in quite a few places and isn't likely to kick up a fuss. Valuable commodities, especially if you like to keep a small squad like LvG or (IIRC) Mourinho.

3060~~~
Zanetti was still at inter when he was there wasn't he? 
Hes similar enough to alonso too imo.

I guess not as a cb though.

3061~~~
You're doing Zanetti a lot of disservice here. He is very underrated player. He is IMO the only one defender who almost shut a healthy Messi off. Giggs did name him the toughest full back he was against in his career. Blind is nowhere near at his level. Blind is too slow and prone to get skinned by pacy wingers.

3062~~~
I'd agree but were talking about a 36ish year old zanetti here.

3063~~~
I was talking about Zanetti vs Messi in those CL semi final legs (Inter vs Barcelona). Yes, he was mid 30s there, and Messi couldn't gain ground against him 1 vs 1 in both legs.

3064~~~
But he will be replaced by a stronger, more physical and most importantly natural centre half. Which is the whole point really. All players mentioned are number one; natural centre halves. Number two; more physical than Daley.

3065~~~
Grab a dictionary, look up the word "context" and familiarize yourself with it.

3066~~~
Agree with the rest, but I'm not sure on that part yet. I think it remains to be seen. If he's not playing, I think there's a good chance he'll want out. He's been an important player in the last 3 or 4 seasons for club and country. I'm not sure he'd want to be a rotation option. I could be wrong, of course, but I think he's too good to be filling gaps here and there. I'd predict Blind himself feels he's too good to be doing that as well.

3067~~~
Perhaps you're right, just seems like a lad that'll get on with things to me.

Of course, it all depends on what offers he'll get if he's told he won't be starting every week here any more.

3068~~~
Shaw is faster and stronger than Blind. He's like Ashley Cole with better crossing. It's hard to see any manager would prefer Blind over a fit Shaw.

3069~~~
He does seem pretty laid back and chill, to be fair. He might just sit on the bench with his feet up without a fuss, then come on and do the Mikel role for the last 10 minutes.

Whatever the outcome, I hope he stays. I'd rather not see him at centre back long term, but knowing you have a player who can come in and do a job there when needed is very valuable.

3070~~~
I doubt Blind will carry on at cb with Mourinho. But I don't see him going. He's a great left back and Shaw was injury prone even before the terrible injury he had this season. Providing Shaw comes back strong and is a first teamer next season I wouldn't expect him to play every match. Blind will be able to slot in perfectly whilst Shaw is out.

3071~~~
I'm not saying blind is as good as zanetti, at any age.
Im saying a 36 yr old zanetti is similar in sytle to blind, which i think is true.

I dont even think mourinho will keep playing him at cb so im not sure why im still arguing this point really.

3072~~~
Just wanted to write this. No way will he be a starting player if everyone is fit. Well said, but we also need players like him.

3073~~~
If Mascherano is indeed moving to Juventus, he might be a good candidate to replace him at Barcelona.

3074~~~
Shaw's only 19 and still learning the game. Blind, whilst not stronger or faster, reads the game better than Shaw, in my opinion. Mourinho likes a defensive back, with the ability to also get forward. Blind can do that, and has a very good delivery and good decision making in the final third.

It was hard to see Azpilicueta playing over Felipe Luiz, but it happened. 

Either way, both are very talented players, and I wouldn't mind who plays there. Guess it depends on the type of game.

3075~~~
Why are we all busy writing our players off? What's to say Blind is not capable of doing an Ashley Young on ADM? 
Can't we just wait till the season gets underway and see how everyone reacts to the new manager. Certain players are quite good at fighting for a place and Blind looks like one of those. Every manager(including Mourinho) like players that will follow their instructions, till Blind shows he not capable of doing so..I will continue to expect progression, same for every other player in the team. 
Mourinho coming in for me is all about the different dimensions he will add to the development of their game. Most want trophies(understandable) but the players have to be developed to right standards first. Hopefully, Mourinho will continue the good he has done with players at other clubs.

3076~~~
When Van Gaal first started he was playing Blind behind Herrera and Di Maria, it showed promise. The biggest crime wasmt moving Blind into defence though, it was playing DiMaria out wide. By far hi sbest seasons have been in central midfield for us, Madrid and Benfica even, total waste of talent by Van Gaal. Blind is a better central midfielder than he is a left back or centre back....but still an average one for me

3077~~~
I disagree with Blind is similar to Zanetti's style. Their similarity ends with versatility, and that's it. Zanetti is like a mixture of Lahm and Irwin. Yes I am talking about mid 30s Zanetti not even prime young Zanetti here. Blind severely lacks strength and pace. Blind is more similar to Heinze than Zanetti.

Watch this. By the shirt, all action in the clip was around the time Zanetti was in mid 30s. Kaka (rapid) couldn't win foot race against Zanetti at 0:35.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZswTfWYmUcQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Zanetti merited his place in Mourinho's team. Not that Mourinho had to shoehorn him. Zanetti's versatility is bonus for Mourinho's tactic, not the reason for his mainstay in Mourinho's set up. As I said in my previous post. Zanetti (mid 30s) had the best one on one defensive performance vs Messi of all players I've ever seen.

Point is I don't see Blind having a solid starting place in Mou team in any positions, when his competitors for these position are fit and in decent form. Blind may get Arbeloa type of role, if he's able to get on good term with Mourinho. However, I can't see Blind be anything past that role with what Blind has shown.

By no mean, I undermine Blind's performance for us these past 2 years. He had solid first season and this season is one of the most consistent performers in our team. He exceeded the expectation this season playing as CB. He is our best signing beside Martial during LVG;s tenure. Just that we're moving away from heavy possession style, that brought out Blind's best attributes, so it's logical to see Blind's starting place would be questioned.

3078~~~
Fine, Zanetti was good, but calling mid-30 Zanetti a mix between Lahm and Irwin is stretching it a bit too far.

3079~~~
Style is the key word, not combined level of performance. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3080~~~
In my mind, this wasn't the weird bit, as much as why Ivanovic despite being not very good any more kept getting picked ahead of a Felipe Luiz LB/Azpilicueta RB combo
Nothing saying it can't happen, but there's nothing wrong with discussing what we think will/could happen. 

On the flip side, perhaps Mourinho lets Carrick go, and gives his role to Blind. This year at CB will surely have helped his positional sense(something he occasionally had issues with in his first season here), combined with his passing and vision could make for a quality holding mid.

Way too open to really know what's going to happen, what formation will we play, where does he see Rooney(CM, AM, ST, China?), who we'll bring in, who we'll sell.

3081~~~
It's just the way all United player tend to be rubbish and the better options always lie elsewhere. Not that it's a new reaction from us fans. 
I like to wait till preseason to see what the manager is working on for the season or how he plans to use players. Even for continuing managers, every new season is a new beginning. Blind might not be his cup of tea but at least then we'd understand why. This is a manager that's played Essien at right back and Zanetti at centre midfield because it's the right tactical play for the team. Blind is only played one full season as CB that should be considered when assessing his season, players don't become the finished article after 1 season. If a day comes where he feels he need a Libero type in defence he won't think twice to put Blind there(if better suited). 
I'm not arguing he should continue as a starting CB or a top CB. All I am saying is noone was expecting Blind to look a better CB than Jones this season considering Jones was rated higher than Smalling by many. This happened in his maiden season season as a CB considering he struggled with the physicality in CM last season.

3082~~~
IMO Blind should be played against teams that will sit back and soak up pressure, where he would be afforded time on the ball and his physical limitations won't be exploited.

3083~~~
Of the 56 games he played, this happened in what, a maximum of 10? December onwards, I thought he was a better centre-back than Smalling.

3084~~~
agree with this mostly. One thing about Blind though, he has continuously been written off during his career for being too slow, too weak, too short etc. And he has consistently overcome those limitations in several positions. I wouldn't right him off just yet

3085~~~
I feel he will take the most hit with Jose arrival. Mou won't use him in defense and not good enough for midfield. Maybe leftback when Shaw needs rest.

3086~~~
True enough, tbh I'd only be delighted if he goes from strength to strength here. He definitely has the footballing intelligence to make up for any limitation. 


Weird thought maybe, but it'd be interesting to see what he could do at no.10, passing, vision, a good long shot and it's a position where quite a few of the best players aren't pacey or powerful.

3087~~~
I am a big fan of Blind, his footballing intelligence is immense. Not sure about him as a ten though. I've always though his best position would be CDM with two box to box CM's in front of him

3088~~~
Don't see we'll see a lot of Blind at CB under Mourinho. Will probably offer cover for CM and LB.

3089~~~
Aye, that's where I think he'll be long term, like I said, the 10 thing was just an odd thought.

3090~~~
Him calling this season a successful season is partly what's wrong with this group of players.

I remember the days when everyone at the club would feel that the end of the season was anticlimactic and felt slight disappointment when we didn't win the CL. This despite us winning the league.

I'm not saying the league is a given, mind. But, at the risk of sounding entitled, calling an FA cup winning season while finishing 5th is in no way a successful season for Manchester United.

3091~~~
That is not the Manchester United Daley Blind joined so while the above is admirable and full of good memories it's all past. It is the level everyone should aspire to, agreed, but it is not the barometer for if a season is "successful" for THIS Man Utd.

That's before dissecting the tone and deliverance of the word "successful" in his quote. The term itself reads very differently on paper to how it could have been said.

Having said all of the above, Jose should hopefully re-align what a successful season is classed as soon enough - back to the glory days hopefully!

Hopefully with Daley as one of the mainstays and regular players too. This poster has a lot of time for Blind.

3092~~~
True, I thought that was a little strange from Blind. A player coming from Ajax should surely be eyeing the title every year, and even finishing 2nd should be disappointing. But I am unsure if he really believes what he is saying about the season being a success, or if he is saying it to back the manager he had a great relationship with. If he says it was a crap season, then he is throwing LvG into the fire.

3093~~~
Blind and Mata can leave says Skysports today. 
Jesus,  parking the bus has allready started.

3094~~~
How does that even make sense? How would selling those two equate to <i>'parking the bus'</i>? I don't get it.

3095~~~
Presumably because players like Blind are suited to possession based football.

3096~~~
So if we don't play 'possession based football', it means we will be parking the bus? Odd logic.

3097~~~
I didn't say the parking the bus line, but yeah not sure what OP meant by it. I can see the logic of Blind not being a Mourinho player if we assume the need for physical players. But Blind isn't 'weak' and he is a player that provides much needed balance in our team.

3098~~~
The poster took a needless dig at Mourinho with his <i>'parking the bus'</i>  comment which clearly has no correlation to the story about Blind / Mata being sold.

If he wanted a proper debate about Blind and his strengths / weaknesses, then he should have posted something to that effect and not the silly little Mourinho dig.

3099~~~
I do think it has correlation. 

If true, he's getting rid of the one player who's capable of defending by putting pressure into midfield and can set up an attack through the middle. If Mourinho is replacing him with a defender who is big and strong, but only defends, poster has a valid point IMO.

3100~~~
Nope. Just a silly childish Mourinho dig.

3101~~~
I like Blind and think he's a good player but I would 100 percent want to buy a new central defender as a starting player. Keep blind definitely as he can play in so many positions and play in them well but having him start in the centre of defense is not how I want to see us progress.

3102~~~
It seems that Barcelona is interested, mainly because he can cover different positions and his ball-playing.

Yeah I still don't agree whatsoever. We have absolutely no idea who Mourinho is signing yet and getting rid of Mata and Blind (if true) simply means that Mourinho doesn't rate / want either player. To be fair to him, Blind is a midfielder / left back who has been played at centre back; I have no issues whatsoever if Mourinho doesn't fancy him. I think he's a useful player but if he's sold, then so be it.

How all of a sudden do Blind and Mata represent possession football, as a matter of interest? And how does getting rid of Blind and or Mata mean we are going to <i>park the bus? - </i>which is what my initial comment alluded to. To me, it's just a pathetic dig at Mourinho.

Funny that selling Blind means we are going to turn into some kind of negative team when we have been heavily linked with John Stones of all people......

3107~~~
Wouldn't trust Sun, especially with transfer rumours. If Barcelona want a ball playing defender to replace Maschenaro (whispers that he may leave to Juve), they should look at Vertonghen who has also come through Ajax roster just like Blind and is a better player in the air with similar quality of passing (Blind's passing is slightly better for me). With Levy you can never be sure of attaining their player, unfortunately.

Getting rid of Blind (assuming transfer rumours are anywhere close to truth) wouldn't necessarily mean Maureen is going to park the bus every game. Though tactics must suit what players are available (check Ranieri at Leicester), it is also possible to play different type of game with almost the same set of players. If Maureen wants to park the bus, he can as well do it with Blind-Schneiderlin double pivot and ask them to shield the CBs while instructing fullbacks to stay near to our goal. Maureen did that by employing Mikel-Matic or Matic-Zouma in big matches at Chelsea.

Fergie played with 7 defenders (and Gibson!) against Arsenal but I doubt many consider the tactics of that match as Utd parking the bus - we defended deep and counter attacked as we know Arsenal's only strategy (back then) like the back of our hand.

Parking the bus is not Maureen's or cannot be Utd's default strategy anyway. We will still dominate possession against a lot of sides even if we are not playing possession based system - simply because we (will) have a better team than most sides out there in league (and group stages of Europa League). Maureen prefers quick transition from defense to attack and Blind can help with it as his first touch passing is pretty good.

Blind has also done solidly well in a lot of positions against a lot of teams. It is nigh on impossible to have a player for every strategy and every occasion and every team. We should utilize players as per their strengths and considering Blind has been largely good for most of his time here, I'd be a bit sad if he were to leave without even showcasing what he can do, to the new manager. I doubt he'd prefer to leave even if told that he's only going to be a squad player - he was given that role initially all through his career and he's done better than expectations to convince his managers he deserved a starting role.

But if Blind were to survive as Maureen's midfielder, he cannot aggressively press from midfield. Pressing has to be a team strategy and it always looked weird how Blind is the only one to go pressing opposition (something he learnt as part of Ajax's basic strategy) while most of our other players looked passive. Herrera and maybe Schweinsteiger are other players who press quite a lot (one played for Bielsa while the other played for Bayern). As a midfielder it is incredibly risky and it would leave the opposition attackers running directly at CBs (never a good idea to let them do it even if your team has world's best CBs) if pressing is not done collectively. I doubt Maureen prefers it as a team strategy and hence I'm inclined toward Blind getting rid of this trait (as much as I love it).

3108~~~
That's your prerogative, but if posters see an issue with Mourinho selling one of our best outfield players of the season then they are fair to judge accordingly.

How do Blind and Matter represent possession football? You should know the former was deployed as a ball playing centre back who, despite very occasional lapses, has great composure in playing out of defence and weaving passes on the ground through to midfield, and interlinking play. Mata's ball retention is also far superior and is trusted in the possessive style of football, but Blind is more of the possession mould out of the two.

3109~~~
Haha funny that a lot of posters on here (myself included) said that blind would be perfect for Barca and is highly underrated as a CB and many people laughed him off saying he's a liability. He hasn't been a liability this year and has been excellent in most games. I knew that Mourinho wouldn't use him as a CB but that's only because the way Mou defends deep doesn't suit Blinds attributes. If Barca can get him for the price touted they will have signed an excellent player for a steal.

3110~~~
I have absolutely no issues whatsoever if people have an issue with selling Blind, as I have earlier stated. My issue is petty digs at Mourinho about <i>parking the bus</i> because Blind and Mata have been linked with a move away from the club.

Funny, I could have sworn that Mata was signed by Moyes who didn't exactly play possession football. Mata's stats have been relativey good but I have been extremely underwhelmed by him since he has come in.

Yeah, Blind can play the ball from the back but there are players that can do that but have more pace & defend better; basically better ball playing centre backs. Who's to say that Mourinho isn't planning on buying a <i>superior </i>player for that position? Why have we been heavily linked with Varane / Stones - both ball playing centre backs - if we are going to <i>park the bus</i>?

What's the obsession with possession based football anyway? We had the majority of possession for the last two seasons and were absolutely wank for the most part. Give me the football we played under the majority of Fergie's reign, than that rubbish any day of the week.

3111~~~
Blind was one of our better players last season, can provide cover in several positions and doesn't get injured (which is a big deal in our current squad). We really need a long term structure in place with regards to squad building. We can't let any manager we hire sell any player he doesn't quite fancy. What if Mourinho doesn't work out, then what, we hire another manager and let him sell any player he wants again? Now Mourinho might not quite fancy a player like Blind but there are at least a half dozen others that we should be looking to get rid of before we even consider selling him.

3112~~~
The caf posts it, suddenly it appears in the news. Coincidence? I think not, Blind being chased by Barca has to be one of the most ludicrous things I've ever seen.

3113~~~
They did sign Vermaelen & Douglas in recent years after all.....

3114~~~
Ya. I think signing Vermaelen, who was injured, was one of the weirdest decisions that Barca took in recent times.

3115~~~
It was bizarre considering he is a constant sick note; we were after him too, which was also bizarre. The signing of Douglas was also really strange.

3116~~~
Apparently I and others were mental to suggest Barcelona would be interested in him...

(Not that papers are gospel but still..)

He'd fit perfectly with them. I know he's shite, too short, too slow and Smalling (apparently) is a defensive GOD compared to him but he would.

3117~~~
<b>Keirrison</b>

3118~~~
He Really wouldn't. Pique is a ball player. They need a no nonsense, top quality replacement for Puyol which they have been chasing for years. One who can do the basics to a high level. Mascherano did the job and now they need another. Blind is such a downgrade on Puyol/Mascherano.

3119~~~
Yeah another awful one. Was talking about the last few years, though.

3120~~~
Really? I think in a lot of ways he'd quite suit them, actually. I could see both Blind and Barca wanting that. 

As soon as it's known a club want to get rid of a player it brings their price down. If they get him for 10m it would be a very decent signing for them.

3121~~~
I think Blind would be far suited to defending for Barca in La Liga then he would for us in the Prem.

He'd get found out in the Champions League though.

3122~~~
I too was ridiculed like I was smoking Crack to even suggest he may be an asset for Barca. how dare me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3123~~~
Blind would be a good signing for Barca.

Strangely people on here under rate him. Barca wouldn't be interested in any of the other central defenders (Smalling, Jones, Rojo).

3124~~~
I'd still ridicule anyone who thinks that barca is going to sign him<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

3125~~~
Why? Not that he's good enough but they require completely different defenders and in the league vs smaller teams he could be of great use, and he's been playing in the Barcelona style since he was a kid.

3126~~~
Barcelona signed Vermaelen and splashed out 30 million on fecking Mathieu. Is signing Blind really that hard to imagine?

3127~~~
Of course it isn't. But this is a Manchester United player here and most of our players are completely shite...

3128~~~
Blind is an incredible CB and one of our best players last season, if Barcelona were to purchase him (I think this is paper BS) anything under 20 million would be an absolute bargain. 

Could cover for Alba, Busquets, Mascherano whilst allowing Barca to maintain their style of play.

3129~~~
Makes no sense to sell such a versatile player in a year where we'll probably clear out or look to get rid of quite a few players. Whatever you think of Blind, he's more than good enough to be a utility player in a side competing for the title.

3130~~~

he was better than shite in an awful team of underperformers who finished 5th in one of the weakest seasons in history and whose GK was POTY. He really isn't incredible at CB unless you have just been told this by friends. Our defence is so weak we must play 2 Holding midfielders even at home versus relagation threatened teams in order to protect it.

Our defence is so weak we must keep the ball for as long as possible and not try anything risky, for fear that our opponents may take the ball and do us serious harm with it(we cannot afford to play expansive).

Our defence is so weak that despite all these precautions, David De Gea still had to face more shots on goal than Joe Hart whilst Man City's defence is sited as their weakness since Kompany never plays. our defence is so weak that David De Gea faced more overall shots than Arthur Boruc and Simon Minolet, both of who played over 85% of their sides games.

Our defence is so weak that when put up against it in games where we really had to win at all costs, it often got torn to shreds and seriously exposed.

What we do have though is the undoubted best GK in the world who possesses catlike reflexes and makes strikers look like poor finishers. Every week he produces a strong of world class saves. If not for David's extraordinary abilities, we would not be F.A. cup winners, would be further down the league and could easily have conceded as much as sides in the mid-table. It is of no surprise that De Gea is the resounding POTY winner each year, as his teammates(including CB) know that he holds them up. We conceded one less goal than Leicester, a team who has none of the ball and throws bodies forward on the counter (taking risks). Despite these contrasts in play they managed to score nearly 70 goals and their defensive record matches ours. They do of course have a solid GK mind you, however I feel Blind at CB in another team would just be average.

3131~~~
all i can say is if we bought him for £14m and he was supposedly one of our better players (not agreeing or disagreeing with it), then we shouldn't be selling him for £14m to barca.  I'd happily take £20/25m and it's about time we start selling players to other clubs for the same amount we'd have to buy them for, not sell them on the cheap.  

eg. Real Madrid wanted rid of Di Maria because they wanted James, so sold him for £60m.  We sell him a year later to one of the richest clubs in the world for £45m.  Mugs

3132~~~
Would agree with that. I'd be annoyed if he was sold for less than £25million given the silly prices going around these days.

£30million ideally.

3133~~~
One more reason we need a director of football - to save us £50m a year on transfer fees.

3134~~~
I'd like him to move to Barcelona and succeed. Before the rumour came out,  no one mentioned him to leave but once it came out he is immediately the scapegoat. He has hardly been a disappointment at LB or CB, makeshift positions when called upon. He had actually done well imo. If a certain Rooney plays in different positrons,  it's called sacrificing for the team but when Blind does it,  he is weak.

3135~~~
They have one of the best ball playing cbs in the world. They dont need blind for that and they don't need "a different type of defender". Barca made some weird transfer decisions in the past and they might continue to do so. It is not impossible that they sign blind. That said it would be another terrible decision, because they could easily get a stronger player.

3136~~~
I'd rather we keep him. He's a very useful player and has been ever so reliable for us this season despite the new position.

3137~~~
Agreed.

3138~~~
Rather we keep him. Very versatile player. 
Pretty good aswell. 
Would make an excellent squad player. 
Prefer him at LB to Rojo & at CB to Jones/Rojo. Could also do a Job at DM. Feel hes very underrated, Did he not pocket Lukaku? 
But according to TheUnitedstand, we should sell him as hes 'apparently' a Van Gaal loyalist?

3139~~~
Why would you like him to move to Barcelona?...I can guess why but don't you think Barcelona have these kind of supporters also?

3140~~~
One of the better players of last season, actually has good character and showed a lot of leadership on the pitch too. Keep IMO if hes happy to be a part of the squad and not a guaranteed starter. He also didn't cost a lot and I doubt his wages are very high too.

3141~~~
Couldn't fecking stand him as first choice centreback. Love him as a utility player.

3142~~~
A bit late to party. However, it wouldn't be a terrible decision, at all. He'd fit in immediately, and could provide cover all over.

I reckon the new manager at our noisy neighbours would love Blind in his team.

3143~~~
If we sell him it will be for £14m maximum. Mark my words. I think we are the worst "elite club" at selling players.

RvP sold for less than £4m <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> will be sold to Lazio at twice the price.

3144~~~
with two more years wear and tear in those knees <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3145~~~
I think the issue here is that everyone is forgetting where Blind should be playing.
He's meant to be a CM (well, CDM) - not a CB. He was placed there as a makeshift. 
I'm personally looking forward to seeing him playing back there. He can pass, is extremely clever on the ball and works amazingly hard.

3146~~~
I remember him at CDM/CM and the issue is he isn't stand out at any aspect of the role. People suggest he is a great passer but he is no deep lying player-maker if you think about it. Think Carrick/Pirlo/Xavi Alonso (maybe it is was the system?). I just remember him being underwhelming in that role. His best passing was demonstrated at CB where you have more time to pick a pass. In the mixer, with tackles flying, he has neither the physical, tactical dribble nor speed of though to perform the DMC/CM role well enough in the premier league. Picture a very poor mans Seedorf. Also he can get walked through in midfield as well. He isn't of the level to be starting 11 of a team that wants to challenge for the title I'm afraid.

3147~~~
Well "incredible" might be a bit much but he has been doing better than expected. He is a Player I would only sell in case we get all our target Players.

3148~~~
Absolutely no chance we should sell him. Need players like him to challenge on all fronts!

3149~~~
i want these transfer rumours to go away now.

3150~~~
I think he will leave this season or next. 

If he stays ,I think he'll see a lot of the bench.

Talks about the Netherlands and a bit about United. This is most of the United related stuff:

3152~~~
Did very well for us, hope he stays as I really like him at cb. Such a smart player!

3153~~~
Dutch media are writing that Arsenal is preparing a bid for Daily.

3154~~~
Not only Dutch media but sky sports saying he's off to Arsenal.

Think this ones smart for both clubs.  Blind is the epitome of van Gaals style of football and will suit a team like Arsenal that want to play football on the deck but he was never going to be physicially imposing enough to be liked by mourinho.

3155~~~
Sounds way too good to be true

3156~~~
Blind to Arsenal. Bah god

Maureen making deal with Arsey ? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3158~~~
Would be sad if this came to pass. I like Blind and I think he would be a really good squad player for us.

3159~~~
Show of faith in Schneiderlein? I thought Jose would at least try Blind in midfield - worth remembering he was rather good there for Ajax and a year playing in central defense would give him some great experience in terms of understanding the DMF role in the premier league. 

Very odd if true.

3160~~~
Rumors are he will return to Ajax. Possibly on loan.

3161~~~
He's one of my favourites so I hope José gives him a chance. His passing is second only to Carrick's in the squad, and the fact he can play in a number of positions is a huge plus, too.

3162~~~
I agree. Won't mind having him back at Ajax, if the other choice is warming the bench at United.

3163~~~
Poor move for him if true, he's too good to be in the Dutch league now. He could do well in Germany somewhere perhaps

3164~~~
Crazy

3165~~~
Arguably our best outfield player last season. Be mad to get rid of him, but I guess Mourinho has his own ideas.

That said, he did say he would like to keep a few multi-functional players, and I guess that's what he would see Blind as, because he isn't really a specialist anywhere.

I would use him as a left back and holding mid next season.

3166~~~
This

People tend to forget how tough this league and how tougher it will be next season with the money coming in and new managers. Ever match will be a decisive one. We need all the help we can get.

3167~~~
Would be a huge mistake to let him leave, I'd have rather let Carrick go and use Blind in midfield personally.

3168~~~
It'd be stupid to let him go.

Jones is mad of chocolate and won't stay fit. Rojo is garbage. Smalling and Bailly are the only other centre halfs.

On top of that, Luke Shaw despite looking good for all of 10 games last season, has never cemented his spot in the team over two years due to a mix of injuries and fitness.

Getting rid of Blind would be stupid.

3169~~~
We've got rid of the moron. Nobody is playing Blind at CB from now.

We should be trying to move him on to a PL club, and extort as much as much money as we can for him.

3170~~~
I'd keep him if he is willing to be a utility player. He has a wonderful football brain and would be good cover for the lb and CDM roles .

I don't see him playing as CB under Jose,and neither do I want him there .

3171~~~
Ajax on loan. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Just sell him or keep him as a utility LB.

3172~~~
This, it would be stupid to sell. Blind can play LB, CB, CDM. The thing im concerned about is that Mourinho said in a interview that he prefers Specialists above Utility players. I would be devestated if we will sell him, good player for the bench and just a important player in the team (Offield)

3173~~~
If we sell Blind and we keep Rojo and Jones, it would be an idiocy that would rival some of Van Gaal's decisions from last year.

3174~~~
Don't think he'll leave this season.. Shaw is just coming back from an injury and other LB options are not great..

He can also play in the middle and is quite a useful and intelligent player.. We have so many other players to get rid of before blind..

If the reason is because he felt LvG had a tough break and Jose didn't want former manager's favored player, that would be a bad move on Jose's part.. (All speculation and absolutely not based on a single credible proof.)

He's definitely a better CM player than Fellaini and a solid LB cover with excellent passing skills.. I truly hope he stays..

3175~~~
He's not a CB, he's well down the pecking order in midfield, and we have Shaw and CBJ for LB. How many games is he likely to play if he does stay?

3176~~~
I definitely agree with this.
Moreover, Blind's comment on LVG when he got the sack was aimed towards the press - not the club and certainly nothing to do with Jose. He has no reason to distrust him. Plus, Jose's never experienced injuries like we have. How does he know for sure his training methods will be so effective? He can't be getting rid of some of our best players (such as they are) whilst we have worse players knocking about.

3177~~~
Too good for Ajax now. He has made the right step in his career to come to the Premier League. He's good enough to stay here and fight for a place. All 3 places in the midfield are up for grabs, and based on the options we currently have, he's got as good a chance of getting one of them as anyone else. He's decent at left back too, and makes up for his lack of pace with good playmaking from wide areas.

I also thought he did fine at centre back too. Certainly did much more good than bad. I'd have no issues seeing him next to Smalling again.

Based on last season, we have little to no pecking order for midfield. Carrick can't play every week and gets niggly injuries, Bastian same, Rooney will hopefully never play there again, Schneiderlin and Herrera are capable of much better than we saw last season but it is up to them to prove it all over again, Fellaini is Fellaini. I don't think Blind as a #6 is out of the question at all.

3178~~~
If we sign Pogba and Matuidi, I doubt he'd get any games in midfield.

People forgetting his terrible midfield performances in 14/15 where he was constantly running up and leaving gaps. He isn't a Jose type sitting midfielder. Our midfield turned to shit when Carrick wasn't playing that season.

3179~~~
I doubt they will be playing the same position this season. 

So in essence,his departure would have nothing to do with those two.

3180~~~
This. Blind can play LB, CB and DM to an acceptable standard and since we do not look like we are signing another defender I think keeping him makes a lot of sense. In fact based on his performances over the last two seasons he shouldn't be on the list of likely departures.

3181~~~
Nope, I agree. I don't see him getting games in midfield either, bar perhaps the odd one in the Europa group stage.

Which leaves him with the back-up left back role. He's a player I'd rather keep ideally and there's much less useful players who could go before him. But I imagine a scenario where he's told he'll be a back-up and the choice will then be down to him.

3182~~~
He can do a lot better than Ajax ffs.

3183~~~
He's a better CB than they will ever be, and he is much fitter than them. Blind doesn't necessarily needs to play CB, but he can surely do that if needed. Rojo can't do anything useful, and Jones is always injured, so I would much prefer to keep Blind as our third CB and use him in other positions too.

3184~~~
I don't think Jose will play Blind there. I can easily see someone like TFM being well ahead of Blind as a CB. 

Playing Blind as a CB means altering the rest of the team to make up for some of his limitations. It usually meant playing  Fellaini providing heading cover and a very defensive two CDM system  . Blind is wonderful especially when playing from the back and is also left footed,but those qualities won't help him much under Jose.

I'm not defending Rojo or Jones. I really don't think they have to worry about about Blind as competition though. I think Jose will be as blunt with Daley about the CB role as he was with Rooney at CM. Most of Van Gaal's experiments are dead in the water. No more Young as CF either for example.

3185~~~
I think Mourinho will sell him, but he shouldn't as he has the intelligence and technical ability to be useful in several positions, his injury record is good (for a United player) and he played well all last season which is a fecking rarity in and of itself.

Yes, Mourinho said he prefers specialists, he did also add he liked to keep 1 or 2 around who could fill in several positions which is what Blind does, (LB, LWB, CB, CM) and he's a great attitude about him and suspect wouldn't complain about a squad role.

Anyway I still expect he'll be out the door by the end of the summer sadly.

3186~~~
I think he will give Daley Blind a year to prove whether:

a) He has the ability to work in a low block defence, or
b) Play a midfielder for us.

I actually think that playing in a high block suits him even less than playin in a low block. Put simply, I prefer defending a cross against Andy Carroll or Lukaku rather than trying to keep up with Thierry Henry. I will not beat Lukaku or Carroll in the air and I bet even today Henry would outpace me. But its easier to make it difficult for someone attacking a cross. Many argue that players like Samuel, Cannavaro or Ayala compensated for lack of height with a great leap/jump. In my opinion it was more about intelligence and timing.

Daley Blind is an intelligent player and could adjust to a lower block. The arguments against it is that he probably benefited a great deal from beeing very familiar with a high block from Ajax and the Netherlands. Another argument is that he was awful at it last season. On the other hand, when Man Utd defended with a low block last season it was because the opponent made us. It was rarely our plan. The horrendous West Ham-game suits as an example. It was chaos, and few defenders would thrive under these circumstanses.

3187~~~
Always seen him as a natural successor to Carrick.

Can defend, can pass, can chase it down in midfield, and can even score the odd goal.

Silly to force him out, but can understand if he himself wants out.

low block, high block... do you mean a high line and deep line? Never heard those terms before

He cant play DMC,not in million years with his current way of play. Hell even as CB,the moment he leaves his starting position,he keeps chasing and chasing,going further and further away from CB position,its kinda funny to watch.

It would be absolute madness to sell Daley at this point in his United career. 
He showed last season he's a very smart, technical player who can adapt to any situational/tactical play. There is so much more "deadwood" around the club than Blind. 
Really enjoy watching the guy play and out think players on the field. Will be curious if he can play the Carrick role with some more dynamic players around him.
Idk for me he's the type of player that i would always want on my squad if i was a player or a manager
