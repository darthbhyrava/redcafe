1~~~
He's officially signed according to the BBC on a 18-month contract.

2~~~
Hopefully he doesn't play this season and we renew Daves contract.

3~~~
Hopefully, that is all.

4~~~
Hopefully he plays for us in the FA Cup. He was amazing last season for Barca, and it was only till last season I actually considered him world class. Let's hope he can show that form for United, whether that's as a back up or a first team member should Big Dave leave.

5~~~
Fantastic addition to the squad.

6~~~
Great signing. Hope he's replacing Lindegaard, though.

7~~~
I hope he's not earning more than Lindegaard.

8~~~
If hes fit, he'll prob get a game vs Cambridge, would be nice

9~~~
feck. Hope De Gea signs that contract. And stays, come to think of it.

10~~~
Welcome Victor.

Lindegaard will get his move away and we have a solid #2. Wouldn't be surprised to see Valdes leave in the summer though if he gets a #1 position offer. This arrangement benefits everyone.

11~~~
He is actually a very good keeper but past reputations last for years and years and years.

He's not David de Gea though. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

12~~~
If I wasn't so afraid about losing de Gea, I'd be over the moon with this.

13~~~
Mignolet and Jones fighting for the #1 spot and we've got Valdes sitting on the bench. You've got to wonder why Liverpool weren't in for him. Surely not because of the wages?

14~~~
Considering his Monaco contract offer, it will be substantially more - however I heard they will be underwriting most of his contract here?

15~~~
Why did Barca get rid of him if he was so amazing? Or did he choose to leave?

16~~~
Not to sound pessimistic but I have very, very shit feelings about this.

17~~~
LVG to make him 1st choice as he meets "philosophy" more.

18~~~
Good signing. Hopefully just a back up and not a replacement..

19~~~
He chose to leave. Barcelona wanted him to stay.

He's signing a 18 month deal. DDG has 18 months on his contract. Doesn't make sense if we're signing him as Dave's replacement.

20~~~
As I said in the other thread - I have absolutely no concerns about losing DDG, because he won't be going anywhere.

Great signing.

21~~~
He chose to leave for a big pay day at Monaco but he got injured and Monaco ended up backing out.

22~~~
Same here. It's an unsettling signing.

23~~~
Not too sure what to make of this, he's an ok keeper nothing more.

In matches he's either hot like de gea (but still not as good) or cold like mignolet. He has no consistency.

24~~~
Great singing also could push De Gea to another level having Valdes behind him.

25~~~
He does raise our sex appeal though.

26~~~
This still isn't on the official site ?

27~~~
Gutted about Lindegaard probably leaving but he deserves to play more with his quality and this is the perfect replacement as a number two. Great signing.

28~~~
Good signing. Now sort our Dave's contract ffs.

29~~~
imo this has nothing to do with De Gea's long term future, if anything it should make him more happy to have a legend as his no2 and share their experiences.  Hopefully one of our youth keepers can step up in those 18 months and take over his place when his contract is up.

30~~~
As if.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.footballzz.com/img/jogadores/91/69891_ori_anders_lindegaard.jpg" src="http://www.footballzz.com/img/jogadores/91/69891_ori_anders_lindegaard.jpg"/>

31~~~
Probably the best back up keeper in the world (or as I fear a decent option if De Gea moves in the summer)

32~~~
I really hope this has nothing to do with DDG.

33~~~
Problem is, we don't know how good he is right now and his only real chance of playing will be in the FA Cup.

34~~~
An average goalkeeper

35~~~
naw, Cech is.

36~~~

37~~~
I'm fairly relaxed about this. He's not a long term option of course so I don't see he has any impact on the DDG situation. if Dave goes this summer we still need a replacement for him, this summer.

He's been training with us for a while I believe, so maybe he's just a good character to have around?

38~~~
It's just me so who thinks he's an average keeper who is totally unsuited to English football?

39~~~
Cech is still one of the top 5 keepers in the league in my book... surprised that Arsenal and/or Liverpool didn't make a serious bid for him.

40~~~
He's clearly not an average keeper. Was one of the best in the world based on his form before his injury and always was a very good keeper before that too.

41~~~
Thank feck for that.

I've never been more confident that DDG will sign after reading that.

42~~~
Nonsense.

43~~~
You think we'd run DDG's contract down and let him leave on a free? IF he left surely it'd be this summer when we can cash in,  or look for some sort of part exchange compensation deal.

44~~~
Replacement = Backup

45~~~
I really, really doubt DDG would left all his pals and join his boyhood club's closest rival. It's just not David, he finally has his Spaniard friends at the club, he's back in CL football and also the club is back on track in general.

46~~~
Every attribute a keeper needs to survive in England he lacks. Feck me imagine him in goals at Stoke.

47~~~
Unless Dave leaves this summer, giving us a year to find a younger more long term replacement for him.

48~~~
I like Valdes but I also likes Anders he really hasnt done that bad for us, Much better than Kuszczak for example

49~~~
Slow down

50~~~
Whilst the obvious first thought is, "Oh no!! De Gea might actually leave" when you think about it, De Gea has been the only player to start every game for us this season. He clearly wouldn't if LVG didn't like something about him. 

Now, having said that, if we see Valdes creeping into the starting 11 every so often, then we should panic <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

51~~~
Red issue in talking shite shocker

52~~~
Lots of keepers struggle under the high ball, it doesn't make them average like you said. He's a great shot stopper, has great distribution and is a really good sweeper keeper. His only real weaknesses were crosses and sometimes concentration imo.

53~~~
Feck. I voted for only 1 signing in the 'number of signings prediction' poll.

54~~~
I expect nothing less from legend like Frans Hoek to bring him to his best. The way he handled De Gea's detriments in such short time is a key to our season so far.

Linde should stay. I don't think Louie tested him under big game pressure yet and it's always good to have three decent keepers. Amos should probably move on and find chances as 1st choice keeper somewhere where will suit him.

55~~~
If DDG leaves I highly doubt it will be because we want him to.

56~~~
In my opinion if you're weak under the high ball and from crosses you will never be more than an average premier league keeper. These attributes are so vital in English football.

57~~~
To me this just makes it even more apparent that DDG is almost certainly off to Real in the summer, but I think we all suspected that anyway.

58~~~
Sick to death of being a feeder club for that lot

59~~~
We didn't, and he isn't

What an implosion on here! Mental

60~~~
Doubt Lindegaard would sit as third choice.

Reminds me of the story about Begovic turning up to see Gomes, Cudicini and Pletikosa training for Spurs. Why would you want to go through that lot.

61~~~
I can't ever imagine he'd be allowed to go to Arsenal. Certainly it'd surprise me though if Liverpool weren't at least trying to get him on loan for the rest of the season or something. I doubt they'd ever be able to sign him, though. He's still more than good enough for a CL club.

Hell, maybe Chelsea will be nice to us and sell him to Real?

62~~~
A goalkeeper in playing every game, shocker. I have no idea whether or not he will leave, but I don't agree with that logic. You do not play a significantly worse player who has no future at the club instead of a good player who is leaving. It's cutting off your nose to spite your face, it would be stupid to do.

63~~~
You jelly, Barney?

64~~~
Like your keepers yeah?! 
Or Chelsea, playing Cech in the odd match?
We even played De Gea in the league cup.

Either way, he'll leave eventually. Just not fully convinced it will be Real

65~~~
I hope it is.

66~~~
Agreed, these people raving about him haven't a clue.

He's really nothing special and was constantly slated by Barca fans. He makes ALOT of errors.

Tbh I'd would've liked to just keep anders as 2.

67~~~
A bit worried about this. Either we're not convinced de Gea will renew or LVG actually considers whether Valdes would be better for us. Valdes wouldn't have signed if he didn't think he'd play and it wouldn't make much sense for us to sign such a good second-choice either. Hmm...

If it's Bale plus De Gea for around 30 million and we replace De Gea with Valdes, then I guess that wouldn't be too bad.

68~~~
Monaco will pay most of his wage, it's a long story.

69~~~
If you're talking about Valdés in 2005 then sure, recent years Valdés was excellent, didn't make many errors and wasn't slated by Barça fans.

70~~~
We've sold them one player that we didn't want to lose.

71~~~
You make it sound like there haven't been rumours and rumblings for a while now. People aren't just imploding because of this one piece of news - it's been simmering for a while now, and everything adds up.

I'd love DDG to say, I just don't think he will, and I also don't think I'm the only one.

72~~~
His lack of aerial ability is a problem, certainly. He's obviously a good goalkeeper in the grand scheme of things but if De Gea were to leave then I wouldn't be all too confident in Valdes over the course of a season. He does have brilliant attributes elsewhere, it must be said.

73~~~
More like top 5 in the world.

74~~~
Yep, genuinely can't understand how people still see him as some sort of liability. He was one of their key players before he got injured.

75~~~
Dont even start mate.

76~~~
What do they mean by "direct replacement"? Is it that if De Gea gets injured he is next in line or that if he leaves Valdes will replace him? Personally I don't think De Gea will leave any time soon but it is a bit worrying if it's the latter.

77~~~
I'll rephrase it, I'm sick to death of them hanging around us like a bad smell. 

Every time we so much as have a player, that's remotely good, it's always "Oh Madrid are sniffing round"

78~~~
Considering what we have in goal, yes.

Are either of Mignolet or Jones world class? No.
Is Cech an average goalkeeper who is much much worse than Courtois? No. 
Neither of those examples work. We (the club, not the supporters) knew Suarez was leaving all of last season apparently. It would be the equivalent of us deciding to play Aspas up front because we knew Suarez was leaving at the end of the season.

79~~~
Direct replacement would either be De Gea being benched (and LVG being insane) or De Gea leaving for Madrid.

80~~~
No even during his last couple of seasons at barca he was making many mistakes and was still slated. He doesn't suit the English game at all.

If he does play I guarantee within a few matches all United fans hearts will skip a beat when we have him in goal.

81~~~
TO everyone losing your shit over this -

- Valdes is a player LvG knows (and brought through to an extent)
- Lindegaard wants to go play first team footy
- Valdes has just recovered from serious injury
- Is available for free
- Wages may be paid mostly by Monaco
- Valdes probably happy to be #2 for now while he recovers

It suits everyone. We get a decent #2, Valdes gets to continue his recovery and perhaps play a few games and Anders gets his move away.

Valdes is more likely to leave when he has recovered in order to play as a #1 again, the 18 month contract will give him security if it doesn't work out (who can blame him after the Monaco fiasco).

That's how I see it.

82~~~
I think at this point if Valdes has anything to do with David leaving, it will not be as a cause, but his signing being a reaction to David letting the club know he wants to leave this summer. 

It could also be a bit of a ploy, give us a good back up, but let David and his agent know there are other options out there for us.  

I had said last summer I thought De Gea might leave after this season, no real specific reason for it, just a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.

83~~~
Kuszczak was ok, Caroll and Foster on the other hand <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

84~~~
Jesus Christ....
How many times have we and other clubs played our number 2 keeper in the League cup and early rounds of the FA cup?! Plenty!!!
My point was that De Gea has even started those games and no other keeper has even gotten a look in, including the MK Dons match, where we all expected one of our back up keepers to play!

It isn't that difficult to understand.

85~~~
This.

86~~~
Why are Monaco paying his wages?

87~~~
Valdes will cost less than Lindegaard because Monaco will pay his wage.

88~~~
I was never his biggest fan. Felt he was overrated by many.

Still he's a step up on Lindegaard in a number of keys areas.

89~~~
Yes, hopefully just a backup.

90~~~
It's an 18-month contract for a player turning 33 in a week.

91~~~
As soon as I heard this I thought De Gea is gone,
Valdes is too good to be a backup, no chance hes signed here to be a backup longterm, no chance.

92~~~
This signing can only be good for De Gea... he has never had a decent and experienced keeper to look up to in terms of advice. For sure Victor Valdes will have very good and insightful advices and tips to share.

93~~~
If he plays, whether this season or next, get used to the aerial bombardment that DDG had to put up with in the early years.

94~~~
He only signed an 18 month contract.  Hardly longterm

95~~~
See the next point. He was done over by Monaco, I wouldn't sign a six month contract in that situation either.

96~~~
How come Monaco are paying him money?

97~~~
Valdes hasn't played properly in 12-18 months, so we've no idea how good a player he still is at all. There's every chance that at 33 he might not be that good at all.

Put it another way, if we didn't have DDG and were signing Valdes right now to be our first choice keeper on an 18 month contract, I'd imagine the general reaction on here would be a big "what the flying feck?", as it'd be a huge risk. I see nothing wrong with assuming he's not our replacement for Big Dave.

98~~~
Don't we have a policy of only offering one year contracts to players over 30? Or 32, or something. That could be why it's so short, not because we intend to move him on any time soon.

99~~~
That would have been nice <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

100~~~
He maybe doesn't suit the English game, that's something he has to prove. Nonsense to suggest he was error prone in recent years though, he was as matching everyone in the world before his injury.

101~~~
18months is longer than the next 6 months DDG will remain at our club I suspect.

102~~~

103~~~
Valdes at his best was exceptional at one vs ones, a lot like Neuer not too many strikers seemed in control of the situation. He's nowhere near as good a shotstopper as De Gea (nobody is as good) and I'd say they're about the same on crosses. And thats Valdes at his best, who knows how he is now?

He certainly wouldnt be among the best 5 replacements for De Gea if that was the case, so hopefully it isnt.

Has anyone mentioned Messi in this thread yet? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

105~~~
We have only sold them one player that we didn't want to sell though.

106~~~
You don't know that and he trained with us for 3 months now. So we know exactly, how good or bad he is.

107~~~
I rephrased it in a post above somewhere

108~~~
I don't see why De Gea would want to leave after us developing a little Spaniard city; it's also been reported that Valdes is getting a house in the same area as De Gea, Mata and Herrera.

109~~~
In the past I always got the impression most on here thought he was quite a poor keeper. I've certainly always thought that so perhaps it was just me 

I don't really care about our backup keepers, they're almost an irrelevance. As long as he isn't being lined up to take over.

110~~~
Ah, fair fecks. I'll back up and look <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

111~~~
There's two other things I like about Valdes. One is that he has exceptional concentration, which you need at big clubs. Its very hard to go 70 minutes where you only see the ball in the distance and then come up with an outstanding save from nowhere.

The other is that he's very good with the ball at his feet and his distribution through both kicking and throwing is excellent. Indeed I'd say this is the one area where he's better even than Dave.

112~~~
Said I was sick of them hanging around us, like a bad smell, when one of our players turns out to be good

113~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

I have to agree with that sentiment!

114~~~
Who?

115~~~
Valdes is a quality keeper, it's hardly in question by those who've watched Barca over the last few years in particular,
Personally would have preffered the Spuds keeper if/when the situation becomes obvious that  DDG is going back home, but on a free you can't complain too much.

116~~~
Is it? Almost all of his distribution was to the first man at Barca, because that how they played. I'm yet to see him play in a team where he is instructed to hoof it forward, like DDG is. The same applies to Neuer, people say he has good distribution and back it up by the numbers, but that is mainly because he passes to the defender every time.

If, by some reason we would lose DDG(*knock wood), we should look at somebody else to replace him. I don't think Valdes is the top Goalkeeper like most here seem to think.

117~~~
Never rated him. He's OK as a backup, I guess.

118~~~
His distribution at Barcelona was phenomenal. I can't think of any keeper with better passing than him (from the leagues I watch - England, Spain and a bit of Bayern). His long range passing was exceptional too, he didn't just pass it out to the defence.

119~~~
Not happy especially as DDG hasn't signed yet. Plus I don't rate him that highly but we'll see. He was always a back up in the Spanish set up and still never a trouble maker, hope it's same here.
And it has been asked a lot here but why/how are Monaco playing part of his wages? Is that confirmed?

120~~~
3 pages on his 'Performances' yet he hasn't even played for us yet.   <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

121~~~
He's free and we might not even need to pay his wages. Why the feck are people still complaining?

122~~~
Very strange post and logic. Cech is a better goalkeeper and yet he is back-up at Chelsea. Navas is arguably better and fulfilling the same role at Real. Just last season Casillas was a substitute at Real. How can Valdes be too good to be a back-up goalkeeper when the above aren't? I don't really know what makes you think there is "no chance" he signed he to be back-up. Also since when has 18 months become long term?

Everything about this deal points towards Valdes being bought as back-up to De Gea. Lindegaard has been reportedly wanting to leave for first team football for a while now. The likes of Amos and Johnson aren't good enough/ready to be our substitute goalkeeper, therefore we needed to sign a new substitute goalkeeper. Valdes is on a free and has worked with LVG before so he is a logical signing and an upgrade on Lindegaard. If he was bought to replace De Gea we would have given him a long term contract (i.e. longer than 18 months). Just after Valdes began training with us De Gea said in an interview that he didn't feel threatened by Valdes. Hardly something he would say if he knew Valdes was being brought in to replace him in the summer.

123~~~
Like we know how good Falcao is and we're still likely to sign him?

He isnt one of the best options

124~~~
Would be good if he signed him to play at CB. He's comfortably better on the ball than any of our current lot there.

125~~~
As a no.2, yes, if keeps quiet on the bench. As a no.1 for the case DDG leaves for Spain? No! Then I'd sign Lloris!

126~~~
I don't know if we are signing Falcao or not, i don't know if we didn't bought him from start, Valdes trained with Hoek who knows him, i will trust him for now.

127~~~
Glad to have him on board, excellent number 2 and a good option if DDG is injured at all.

128~~~
If any DDG rumours about Spain are true, we should try to sign Cech. I don't think they will be though...hopefully.

129~~~
Cech lost his place at the start of the season in a battle to remain no.1, and generally been very quiet on the subject since, hands up who believes Cech will still be happy to be Chelseas no.2 at the begining of next season or will remain a Chelsea player at all come the summer?
Navas was at... Levante? yes? Levante.. not the undisputed no.1 in an all conquering (Domestic & European) Barcelona team, sweeping all trophies before them, secondly Navas signed in a time where Casillias position was under threat due to massive scrutiny, and expected a battle to claim the no.1 spot, rather than automatically resigning himself to being a benchwarmer indefinitley as you propose Valdes is happy to do.

130~~~
Lloris is 4 years younger and also the better goalie

131~~~
agree with this

Cech surely too ambitious to warm Chelsea's bench

sad to see DDG go though but he has 18 months left and we'd be mad not to sell if he doesn't want to extend

132~~~
I expect we've signed him because Linde and Amos want to leave. If van Gaal thinks he's replacing de Gea with Valdes he'd likely have a mutiny on his hands with the fans. 

I think he's a good signing - it stops Liverpool getting him (as petty as that sounds) and he'll push de Gea to continue his ascent.

133~~~
We're signing him, that doesn't mean he's De Gea's replacement. Thats where he wouldnt be a top 5 choice, not as a backup

134~~~
I still think, or rather hope, that DDG will stay with us. But if not, Valdes is half decent option and we should try to sign Cech.

135~~~
How about Schmeichel? He's the same age his father was when he joined us.

136~~~
Can someone pray tell why Monaco are paying him his wages at United? If so, why wouldn't Monaco sign him themselves? This doesn't make any sense

137~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Our back up keeper is better than Liverpools first choice, and arguably more than half the first choice keepers around the league.

138~~~
ill start by saying de Gea is my favourite player at the club and we should keep him at all costs, nor do I think he's leaving. However if the situation arises that he wants to move and absolutely huge money is on the table which forces our hand, a victor valdes fully recovered, would be one of my top picks for a replacement. only other keepers that could be better are cech and lloris. Lloris has just signed a new deal and levy would be charging 30m+. But something about having valdes would give me comfort if dave departed.

139~~~
Anders seems like a great bloke. And didn't really have a chance to impress or unimpress...well, shit at trainings? <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

140~~~
To be honest, once De Gea found form he was always going to struggle to get in ahead of him.

141~~~
Lindegaard or Valdes.....I'm not so sure

Anders has been a great option for me and, without being as superhuman at shot stopping as De Gea, he's been very solid

142~~~
He's never really impressed in his first team opportunities and he has had a few. Kicking and decision-making leaves a lot to be desired. Shame as he seems like a very cool bloke.

143~~~
Back-up keepers rarely get a look in. It takes a serious injury or a monumental drop in form for them to really get a chance.

And 'resting' keepers is the most pointless thing a manager can do. The more football your #1 plays, the better. 

It's a tough game, but they surely know what to expect when they come into clubs like United, Chelsea, City etc. Lindegaard did seem to be a class above the usual '2nd choice' keeper though. Valdes, if brought in as De Gea's number two only, another class above.

144~~~
Hopefully is just a back up, only signed on a 18 month deal so presume so.

Hes a better version of Barthez, exceptional on his day but too many cock ups, parring and punching.

145~~~
Great number 2 to have behind Dave!

146~~~
Barca DNA <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

147~~~
So Lindegaard is worse than Mignolet?

148~~~
DDG has 18 months to go and Valdes has been signed for 18 months.  Seems like the best insurance deal you could possibly make.  It says to DDG's agent that if he's going to make silly demands or tell his client to go to Real we have a replacement waiting.  It also means DDG has more serious competition for his spot (not that he needs to be pushed, as his form is excellent), it seems like Anders was not liked by LVG for whatever reason.  I'm not a huge Valdes fan, he's a great sweeper keeper but I'm not sure he is suited to the premier league.  Barca were the ideal team for him, it played to all his strengths and helped cover his weaknesses, without that he might end up looking distinctly average.  But he suits LVG's style so he is an ideal 2nd choice.

149~~~
Waaaaa <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

If Dave leaves I'm gonna cry

150~~~
A few people have said this. I don't see how this stance helps. So you effectively tell him "We'll be okay without you" and make him feel less indispensable than he is. How does that help exactly?

He's not exactly going to be short of offers and he's a season away from being a free agent.

151~~~
I meant Falcao.

152~~~
It doesn't help DDG - it's not meant to?  If he signs a new deal, which is what the club wants then in 18 months (or less) Valdes will probably move on to another club.  When a players is completely and utterly indispensible to the club then he can demand whatever he wants... Rooney? Rio (before Vidic)?  It says "If you want to be at our club, then we are willing to make you a <b>huge</b> offer to stay but if you want to demand you be the highest paid player at the club you can forget it, we will sell you on".  It's just good planning.

153~~~
My guess is he's using United to get himself on the shop window with a few performances and in turn we get a great second choice keeper. I wouldn't worry about the De Gea rumors, he was already training with us before they were even sparked.

154~~~
Can he play right back? Because we could do with one

155~~~
What battle? Courtois was first choice from the very first game of the season. Basically once he arrived at Chelsea he was 1st choice. There was no battle. In public Mourinho didn't say who was going to be first choice but he had obviously made his mind at that stage. It wasn't like the situation at Spurs when Lloris first joined and spent most of his first few months there on the bench behind Friedel before establishing himself as 1st choice. If Cech was to leave in the summer he will still have spent a season sat on the bench. That is only 6 months longer than Valdes will have to do before his contract expires. 

Yes Valdes was a part of a very successful Barca team but since then he has suffered a serious injury and is a few years older. If he was still at the level he was back then do you think Monaco would have pulled the plug on the deal and agreed to pay some of his wages even though he will never play for them?

156~~~
If we lose De Gea, I will be exactly as apocalyptically pissed off about it regardless of whether Lindegaard or Valdes is the back-up at the time. How much better Valdes is than Lindegaard is irrelevant - De Gea is leagues better than either.

157~~~
He was signed around the same time as DDG.  He was never going to be number 1 unless DDG totally flopped.   He was here to do exactly what he did, take some pressure off DDG during the first season or two.  Once DDG found his footing, that was it for Anders.

158~~~
So are Madrids in there retrospective league and Bayern in theres, Big club syndrome man get used to it, LVG is treating us like we should be treated, big manager, big club, big players

159~~~
If this is true (yet to be confirmed by the club) then I'm pleased with this signing. I just hope that he is only coming in as our number two rather than replacing De Gea. If it's an 18 month contract though then that should mean it's as back up only.

160~~~
Bye Dave

161~~~
I can't get excited by this purely because of the possible worst-case scenario.

162~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Completely baffled at the reaction to his signing. He has clearly been brought in to be a back-up goalkeeper, and a very good one at that, but this place is in mourning because people for some reason think Valdes joining confirms that De Gea is off.

163~~~
I'm not normally the pessimist, but I'm really don't trust this signing with regards to De Gea staying.

164~~~
Great signing. At 34 he won't be demanding to play as number 1.

I think this signing was made with Champions League in mind for next season. Also, to avoid the state of being "totally fecked" if the big Dave gets injured.

165~~~
He's 32

166~~~
Have a feeling a new contract for DDG will be announced quite soon. These types of things happen often.
I am not worried about DDG leaving us.

167~~~
Also Valdes adds to the players that have a winning mentality, and that aura spreads throught the squad to players that maybe haven't won as much.

168~~~

169~~~
He was on 90k a week at Barcelona and Monaco offered him 150k before his injury, so is he going to take a wage cut?

170~~~
I meant at the end of his 18 month deal (if De Gea extends his deal which is what I expect). He'll be 33 in a week.

171~~~
Well he lost out on his Monaco move after failing a medical so he may well have to take a pay cut.

172~~~
Don't understand the thinking tbh, we have bagged a top class keeper for nothing, we can now sell Lindegaard for a fee with no need to spend to replace him, and if the worst should happen and DDG should leave, or get a long term injury we have first class back up.

Good business all round.

173~~~
Nice but I don't want us to sell De Gea cos of this. Makes me a bit nervous to be honest

174~~~
OMG WHAT ABOUT DDG WONT SOMEONE THINK OF DDG??

175~~~
I've read reports saying Monaco will pay part of his salary at United. It seems there's an unresolved contractual dispute, with Valdes claiming he's entitled to the salary he signed for. Monaco paying part of his wages for an unspecified amount of time could be the resolution.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/544922/Victor-Valdes-Manchester-United-Monaco-compensation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/544922/Victor-Valdes-Manchester-United-Monaco-compensation</a>

176~~~
I'm not excited about this, if he's back up fine but it's not as if he'll get many games. Hopefully that's all he would be though

177~~~
the possible loss of De Gea is bigger than the joy of Valdes sitting on the bench. Llike we would need a top backup goalie. In a normal situation, De Gea will play most games. Unless de Gea signs a new contract extension, i cant get excited.

178~~~
I don't see why this is a bad move or signs of a dark cloud over DDG's situation. If anything, we just signed a very decent backup and a new big brother for the rest of the team, including DDG. Most goalies (not all, but most) at that age start playing less matches unless they are freaks of nature, which is not quite the case for Valdes when you compare him to the likes of VDS, Schmeichel, Kahn and other top goalkeepers who maintained themselves until being near 40.

179~~~
Well I like Anders also maybe that is why I kinda want him to go somewhere where he will get his minutes as he is obviously very good keeper who could be no1 in decent clubs. Maybe he also wants move as he don't want to be forever no.2 goalkeeper and it's understandable. We could have Valdez for almost two years and then Sam Johnstone can come back and do the no.2 as for him it's good that he plays and plays games right now..

180~~~
I highly, highly doubt Valdes has signed to be a backup keeper.

181~~~
Well, he's surely not going to be first choice this season.

182~~~
I highly highly doubt United will sell DDG.

183~~~
The most likely explanation is that he's signed up as part of his rehabilitation, so to speak - stay at a top club with the right facilities, get his fitness up properly again, and then grab some matches here and there to get back his sharpness. That would make sense. Only problem I see is that we can't offer him much in the way of dead rubbers until next season.

If he's fine with just hanging about, being a regular 2nd choice keeper (which means zero game time unless Dave gets injured), that would surprise me. He's only 32. He should be looking at signing up as someone's No 1 - and he can easily get a decent gig too, based on his reputation alone.

184~~~
Well, of course they won't. If/when he leaves it'll be because he wanted to, and not because United wanted to sell him.

185~~~
The idea of Valdes coming over from Spain to live in Manchester, in order to sit on United's bench for the next few seasons is too dumb for me to convince myself it's plausible.

The idea we wouldn't be about 10th this season without De Gea is also too dumb for me to justify trying to think it.

This is therefore horrible news.

186~~~
Of course he has, he's knocking on now, just had a major injury, still wants fat pay packet, and doesn't fancy slumming it at a lower level club.

Our offer was perfect for him, plus next season hopefully we'll play loads more games, so he should get some playing time.

187~~~
If they get a big offer for him and he's not interested in signing a new deal, there wont be much of a choice to make.

If you think about it logically aswell...if you're De Gea, the prospect of Real or Barca is probably more appealling than United, for pretty much any reason you can think of. Why would you want to stay if those were the options on the table?

I'd be delighted if he signed a new deal, but it'd also surprise me more than it would if he left in the summer.

It was always the risk/inevitability when we signed him and it will more  than likely happen sooner or later. The more concerning aspect is the idea that the club think Valdes is an adequate replacement as first choice. It's the sort of thing QPR would do.

188~~~
Either way, he's better than Lindegaard.

189~~~
An utterly pointless signing. Lindegaard is a fine backup and there was no point in bringing in another player, who will cost more, to sit on the bench and rot. We have the 2nd best goalie in the world and to bring in another goalie was pointless. That was literally the last position we needed to fill.

190~~~
Obviously something is going to happen, either DDG or Lindegaard will leave.

191~~~
That is my point. I would rather neither left and we didn't spend more money in the goalkeeper position. I guarantee Valdes plays less than 25 games for us. There is no point in having DDG leave in 18 months and a nearly 35 year old Valdes as our number 1 choice.

192~~~
It basically comes down to whether you think De Gea is leaving or not. I think De Gea leaving is just a matter of when and not if.

193~~~
Sometimes things can be out of the club's hands.

194~~~
If we're accepting that De Gea is leaving, why not wait until closer to the date and find a goalie who can be the long term number 1?

195~~~
Maybe it's Lindegaard ?

196~~~
You want De Gea to leave on a free? His contract will have 12 months to go in the summer. If he refuses to sign a new contract, that's when the club will sell him. Thus, we need his replacement by this summer.

197~~~
Don't think he is at all, never have really, he looks way too cosy with his Spanish pals here, and now Valdes has joined the clan to put the icing on the cake!

198~~~
Ok if he leaves in the summer then we sign a goalie in the summer. Whats so hard to understand about that?

199~~~
Valdes has joined to bring speculation to his starting position.

200~~~
Maybe LVG has decided that he wants Valdes as first choice next season?

201~~~
This signing says nothing about De Gea's place. If anything, it says more about Lindegaard. You lot are just so scared easily its unbelievable, I don't think De Gea will leave, he is far too settled and we are going to be back in the Champions League next year without a doubt, as well as (with the right signings etc) a shout to win it next year. I think he'll sign that new contract, I can see Navas taking over from Casillas more than I can see De Gea taking over. Why else would they sign one of La Liga's best goalies to be a back up?

202~~~
him and hart can compete for the smuggest face after a save award

203~~~
I can't back that decision. It would be absurd. We want to put all our eggs into the basket of a 33-34 year old goal keeper who hasn't played in 8-10 months? Baffling.

204~~~
We replaced a fully capable second string keeper with an older one who has never played in the league and definitely earns more money? Brilliant idea, that.

For the bolded, is that not what you're suggesting that we're doing?

205~~~
He's also clearly NOT as good as De Gea. He's older, and he's been injured, how do we know he is of that same level anymore? As you said, he's never played here, so why is he our replacement? We aren't doing that.

206~~~
I'm happy we have him but it does make me a worry a bit about DDG. Valdes is still at a great age for a GK and with LVG seemingly always wanting to play his number 1 why would he sign? Only thing I can think of it's an ideal situation for both club and player as he gets himself back to full fitness whilst trying to find another club OR DDG is off.
One thing that has always struck me is DDG seems to love the club. I think and hope he stays and if so we have a great couple of GK's now.

207~~~
It's not just Lindegaard who could be moving on, apparently the club won't stand in Ben Amos' way if another club comes in for him. I guess he's getting to an age now where loans just won't do and he needs to play every week. It does seem as though van Gaal has been looking for a back up goalkeeper, apparently he tried to sign Kenneth Vermeer last summer.

208~~~
I asked why is he the replacement for Lindegaard...

We don't need a replacement for an already suitable, cheaper, and younger snd string goalie.

209~~~
I'd drive Amos to the 4th division club of his choice. He's atrocious.

210~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

211~~~
You don't give your first choice goalkeeper an 18 month contract.

He was signed to be a backup keeper and to help continue his rehab.

212~~~
Because valdes is as good as anybody else likely to be available... He is free and keep in mind he is younger than van der sar was when he joined so no reason he can't be here for years

213~~~
Because Lindegaard is shite and Valdes isn't?

214~~~
Hes not even half the goalie Van Der Sar was.

215~~~
Great cover for De Gea and a solid defensive reinforcement, he can also work his way back to full fitness in a easy and slow manner.

However if he's a direct replacement for De Gea..................<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

216~~~
Lindegaard really isn't shit though, is he?

217~~~
Well, he isn't very good.

218~~~
He's been pretty dreadful everytime I can remember him playing since pretty much his first season. Not good enough for this level, and I suspect thats also why he doesn't even get cup games.

219~~~
My abiding memories of Lindegaard are from the 4-3 win against Reading in the cup where he was hopeless at corners/crosses and the 5-5 against West Brom, where he was just hopeless. I wouldn't really call him a shot stopper as he rarely made any saves 1on1 or anything out of the ordinary and every decent shot seemed to go in against him, though I did think he was solid and reliable until that Reading game. He's hardly played since then, for good reason.

220~~~
People being a bit harsh on Lindegaard here. Hasn't done anything wrong as far as I can recall, been solid enough whenever called upon. That said, Valdes is far superior - too good to be a number 2...

221~~~
We're in for Molde's goalie Orjan Nyland to replace Lindegaard. Apparently.

222~~~
Mad that he, Reina and Cech are currently backups. Early 30's is nothing really, especially when none seemed as drained as someone like Iker did for a while.

Hopefully signed to quickly sell to Liverpool or Arsenal for £5million.

223~~~
Why would our 3rd goalkeeper need replacement at all?

224~~~
Straight swap for Lindegaard. Ben Amos has been told he's free to leave apparently, so it would make sense.

225~~~
Liverpool's number one summer goalkeeping target is going to warm our bench, beautiful, just beautiful. Sign of things to come!

226~~~
Him, De Gea, Mata and Herrera on the same street. Brilliant.

227~~~
Recent stuff? I know we were linked with him a couple of months or so ago but not heard much since.

228~~~
I've seen reports about Ben Amos being told he can leave that also mention the link with Nyland. Its recycled from the first reports in November but basically points to the deal still being on. He looks like a very good keeper, I wouldn't mind us signing him.

229~~~
Can he play right wing back?

230~~~
Basically 

If he's a backup for DDG - Yay!
If he's a replacement for DDG - Boooooo!

231~~~
hopefully this means that Lindegaard is off and he is simply taking the number two spot while he trains and gets himself back to his old form. DDG should stay our first team keeper, and hopefully this signing doesn't signal issues going on behind the scenes with his contract extension. Would really like that to be sorted out quickly.

Though either way, with only an 18 month contract, Valdes is clearly not being signed to be our number one keeper for the long term.

232~~~
If he's backup for De Gea - meh
Replacement for De Gea - sack LVG
Signing him so Liverpool can't - lol

233~~~
Because Lindegaard wanted to leave? There are already rumours about him asking to leave at the start of the season.

234~~~
He never wanted to leave but he was told he could leave.

235~~~
We will never know what is happening in his head. Obviously he would like to be a Man United player but inside, I'm sure he wants to play and has been looking at his options for a while now.

236~~~
We will never know what is happening in his head. Obviously he would like to be a Man United player but inside, I'm sure he wants to play and has been looking at his options for a while now.

237~~~
He wanted to leave in the summer, but didn't because he couldn't find a club. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9422290/transfer-news-goalkeeper-anders-lindegaard-considering-manchester-united-exit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Link</a>

238~~~
People need to calm down with this De Gea stuff.

All the signs point at Valdes being back up/rotation and not a direct replacement for De Gea. For a start, his contract would be longer than 18 months.

Valdes will have been brought in as direct competition for De Gea. Just having Valdes in the squad for the past few months has pushed De Gea on to be an amazing keeper. Valdes would have been happy to settle for that kind of role in a team with a large Spanish contingent outside of Spain. And lets be honest, outside of Barcelona and Real Madrid, United are as big as they come, so of course he'd be happy to stay and compete for a place.

239~~~
is this a done thing? not on manutd.com as yet. why so?

240~~~
Add's cover that imo is better than Anders but also is an experienced (spanish) head behind DDG. I think this will only be a positive influence on DDg and spur him to continue to grow as a keeper. Valdes has lot he can share with big dave and also offer us that confidence in our back up if he ever needs a rest or gets an injury.

241~~~
I reckon Van Gaal got Valdes so then he can get Valdes and DDG to compete for a place within the squad, with this it will provide more sharpness and less relaxed and commitment to play their up most best. At the moment DDG is 1st choice goal keeper by default because Lindergaard is not good enough to compete with him. If DDG do dip form then you got a back up goal keeper who is ready prove himself, he has dip form himself throughout the years but I reckon with uniteds goalkeeper coaching staff by his side and a healthy competition between him and DDG, I reckon he'll get back to his best. So what better to have two top class goal keepers to compete for a place in a team. If Valdes doesn't live up to it, not gonna bother no one because he's only got 18 months and got him on a free.

So overall its brilliant signing, not the one we really need but I see why LVG got him as DDG needs another player at his standard to compete for his place, so then it will improve DDG more and be less relaxed.

242~~~
It's interesting how people are so wildly divided on this. Either A.) it's a good signing for DDG because it will push him and help him become a better GK. or B.) it is terrible because he is going to be his replacement when De Gea leaves. Personally this worries because I think DDG may be leaving. If we've signed Valdes to be his replacement then I will not be impressed. Not because he isn't a good GK, I think he's decent enough, but we could and should do better.

243~~~
The length of the contract leads me to believe that it's just as a back-up or even as a way to earn back some money for his recovery process (which we enabled) or just professional courtesy to a professional LvG clearly considers a friend of sorts. It does add a great safety net for us in case De Gea gets a case of the UnitedPlayersGetInjuredOutOfNowereDisease. If our donut loving spaniard can learn a trick or two from having Valdes around and it helps him to push himself even further in his abilities, it's well worth it in my opinion.

244~~~
Might be a "try him out first and see if he's healthy" sort of thing.

245~~~
Sky sports have also suggested he is coming in as our number two. I suppose this issue will carry until De Gea hopefully signs a new contract.

246~~~
Yeah, that too. It's a big if, but if he can match his old level and be consistent like that for at least a year or 4/5 (if he ages well) then he would be quite the catch for a lot of clubs. Not sure if he's right to be our #1 though, would much rather keep Dave until he's too old to stand, but hey.

247~~~
What if we have this figured out all wrong and he's been signed to be backup to DDG...who himself will be a backup to our new no.1 - Anders Lindegaard.

248~~~
I would have thought they are trying to get him fit and the next step of that is games. He can't play unless we sign him to a contract. He can then get the odd game in the cups and even for the U-21's. Just training with us would not help find a club. I am not worried that David is going to leave. He is a kid in goalkeeping terms and I still thinks he believes he can develop further with us.

249~~~
Like Chelsea 2 of the top 10 best goalkeepers in the world will be on our books, all be it Chelsea still have the better in my opinion, but United will probably be the 2nd strongest club in the world in the goalkeeping department.

250~~~
I think De Gea is better than Courtois and Valdes is on par with Cech. It's not improtant though because you only get to play one at a time and Cech will leave Chelsea sooner rather than later.

251~~~
Disagree with that, but all about opinions i guess.

252~~~
The worst scenario, of course, is this: DDG will not be signing a new deal, so will be sold this summer, probably to either Barca or Real, for good money. Valdes will be his replacement for the last year of his deal. If he performs well, he'll get another 2 year deal at best (he'll be 34 then), if not, during that year we will be looking for our next long term GK.

253~~~
Barca have a transfer ban.

254~~~
Signing for Barca this summer would be a hell of a trick.

Not sure why signing valdes suddenly means de gea is leaving. Hes coming back from serious injury, is obviously positioned to be number 2, lindegaard has been making noise about leaving for a while, so it makes good sense. Even better is that he is likely mates with de gea and knows the manager well.

255~~~
He's a keeper who's played with the best team of the 2000s winning everything in the process, relatively young still at 32, who's recovered from a cruciate ligament injury, which surely is less impacting than for an outfield player. Do we really think he's signing to sit on the bench for 2 years?

256~~~
Yes. Will play cup games but that's about it. De Gea will get his contract soon.

257~~~
Well I don't. Why would he?

258~~~
The fact he left Barcelona to go to Moncao says it all, especially as he still would have been their no1. 

He is looking for an easy pay day, pure and simple. Great back up if we need, but that is all he will be.

259~~~
Valdes is a very, very good keeper. Been outstanding the last few years. He's played for one of the world's best teams and wasn't really looked at as a weakness for them. He wasn't just a passenger either, he was a top performer.

260~~~
He definitely looked a weakness for Barca for many years.

However he was excellent in his last 2 seasons. Not as good as De Gea though.

261~~~
De Gea is better but Valdes is excellent at being a sweeper keeper (at least was prior to his injury) which is something that LVG & Hoek value really highly and at the moment DDG definitely needs to improve his distribution so this will keep him on his toes.

262~~~
Still no confirmation from the club!? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is like summer all over again, our transfers come out of the blue but are then the world's worst kept secret for a couple of days.

263~~~
He will most definitely provide competiton to De Gea, they are both number one goalkeepers in their own right. Like a few other posters have noted Chelsea very much have the same in Courtois and Cech. It will provide very healthy competition, Lindegaard is clearly not of the same standard as De Gea or Valdes.

On a side note what shirt number do we think Valdes will wear? In training he's been wearing 32.

264~~~
We are certainly increasing our star power. our marketing will go through the roof with a few more big name players joining the club.

265~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/RsGAxxm.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/RsGAxxm.jpg"/>

266~~~
They obviously listen to me.

267~~~
Well it's confirmed.

Welcome Valdes!

268~~~
van Gaal:

269~~~
It worries me a little as a player like him at his age isn't going to sit on the bench for 18 months, but hopefully it means nothing for DDG. At least it gives us great back-up and means De Gea can be rested more. Welcome officially Valdes.

270~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

271~~~
Thank god!

I can be happy about the signing now <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

272~~~
Yesss!!

273~~~
If this is the case I welcome him.  But I must admit that'm I'm skeptical about DDG long term plans.

274~~~
Best #2 in the world if that is the case. "Happy with that, lads" as Chris Woods said in the Giggsy doc. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

275~~~

276~~~

277~~~
There's an interview on MUTV in 20 minutes. Rivers will be appreciated.

278~~~
Anyway, our second choice 'keeper > All of Liverpool's goalkeepers combined.

279~~~
I guess we'll see him play his first game v. Cambridge?

280~~~
Ha! Our Second Goalkeeper is fecking Victor Valdes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

281~~~
Good stuff. Top tier number two.

282~~~
I know, it just hit me now! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

283~~~
Fair fecks to him, knows what to say.

284~~~
It is ridiculous when you think about it. He was the goalkeeper for arguably the best club team of all time, and he's actually improved since then. It's why people are getting nervous, it seems to good to be true. And I was gonna make the obvious joke about our second keeper being better than Liverpools first choice, but that's been true for 3 months anyway

285~~~
Now for DDG to renew his 10 year contract with a £200m release clause. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Wishful thinking i know. </span>

286~~~

287~~~
Maybe already tomorrow for the U21's

and our No.3 is better than a few No.1's at other PL clubs <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

288~~~
Building up quite the Spanish speaking clique here aren't we?

289~~~
Great that he's said that. He didn't have to but hopefully it's put a few at ease.

290~~~
Top man is Victor.

291~~~
His English is impressive.

292~~~
De Gea and Valdes + some quality young goalkeepers Johnstone, Pereira and Milinkovic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

293~~~
Amazing that we've brought in Di Maria, Falcao and Valdes in the past half season. We're not messing around anymore.

294~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

295~~~
Could do with another.

296~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

297~~~

298~~~
Once DDG signs a new contract then I can enjoy this, but not a second before!

299~~~

His English isn't bad - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Exclusive-Interviews/2015/Jan/Victor-Valdes-exclusive-first-interview-after-signing-for-Manchester-United.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...e=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

Welcome Victor! 
Now lets get DDGs contract sorted!

302~~~
impressive interview on MUTV.  It's a worry as regards DDGs future, but in the short term this seems like an excellent addition. He seems like he will get on well with the players, and adding such an experienced, successful player can only be a good thing for morale.

303~~~
Great interview!

304~~~
He is quite a handsome bugger isn't he? Better when he had longer hair but still a welcome addition to the likes of Mata, RVP, Falcao and Blind as part of our sexy clique.

305~~~
No way.

306~~~
Great to have such a quality back up keeper! It is weird though, I don't ever remember being so uninterested after signing someone who is actually a quality player. Probably because if we do see a lot of him then it means something happened to De Gea.

Also, how on earth did the teams with the 3 best keepers in the world all manage to get quality back up keepers who would start at most other top teams? United and Chelsea, and Bayern to an extent as well.

307~~~
What this quote doesn't show is that Valdes actually says 'David is the best keeper in the world for now Muahahahahahaha' and then  processed to walk off twirling his moustache.

308~~~
Straight out of an abercrombie and fitch catalogue.

309~~~
Where's that handsome XI thread gone? LVG is clearly building a squad to win the alternative handsome league.

310~~~
Remember when our GK backups were Roy Caroll, Tomasz Kuszczak or Ben Foster ?

Van Gaal is taking some things on a new level in this club. Good deal.

311~~~
Welcome Victor! Great to have you along, hope you're not here to take Dave's spot.

312~~~
His interview was great. He seemed genuinely pleased to be at the club. I like what we're doing at the moment. We're buying class all over the park.

313~~~
He's lacking hairsthetics.

314~~~
Well that puts an end to the Strootman links.

315~~~
Just in case you thought Ballague knew an iota about Spanish football...

316~~~
Him in a United top just looks strange.

317~~~
I've always admired him as a keeper. Never thought he'd come here but a great acquisition.

318~~~
Meanwhile at RAWK : 

<i>"That's 2nd player who has joined them for money or otherwise instead of joining us, players we needed. Falcao and Valdes. Awful."</i>

319~~~

320~~~
I still get that with Mata. Hell, I sometimes get it with Van Persie.

Change confuses and upsets me <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

321~~~
Same. Van Persie, Mata, Falcao, Valdes, Di Maria...

Still not used to Michael sodding Owen yet.

322~~~
Hopefully van Gaal lives up to his word and keeps Valdes as a second keeper. I'm not too worried about the whole situation, though. I'm just very happy that we got Valdes for almost nothing whilst making some good money out of Lindegaard as well.

It seems to me like Valdes will be here to sharpen himself up for the near future as well as provide some good experience for de Gea and our defenders. Having him as a 2nd keeper is very good as that'll mean we won't really miss de Gea if the worst case scenario does pop up.

323~~~
9 pages discussing a performance yet to happen.

324~~~

325~~~
He was one of the best goalkeepers in the world when he got injured. 

It is a little amazing that we've managed to get him as a no.2. I thought a lot of clubs would have loved to bring him in as a no.1 but I suppose with the injury he is a risk.

I think Valdes will help De Gea with his distribution and provide strong competition which can only help De Gea. 

Can see this signing only as a positive.

326~~~
Welcome Valdes!

327~~~
To be fair that is not much of an achievement nowadays.

Valdes is a great option to have, just depends how will he recover from his injury.

328~~~
I also think this is an insurance policy incase things take a turn with De Gea this summer.

Personally think David will sign and stay here as he seems happy here but incase he does leave I don't think we could do any better than have Valdes as his replacement. That too on a free.

Great interview.

331~~~
Nice Interview, the bit about the rain <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I remember all the Spaniards at uni complaining about the cold, I'd just look at them and say never move to Sweden.

332~~~
Valdes on being De Gea's competition: "I'm here to help everybody. I'm a part of the team. I'm not a problem, I'm just a part of the team."

333~~~
It was like 5-10 degrees warmer in the UK than the Madrid derby last night. Quit your moaning Victor! The rain keeps it mild, embrace it.

334~~~
Does not make sense. I guess Lindegaard will be sold asap, waste of salary at the moment.

335~~~
Both Lindegaard and Amos will be finding new teams.

336~~~
Valdes has apparently a very high opinion of himself, so i wonder how much of himself believes that he is going to take De gea's place.

But he is from Barcelona, i'm from the south of France and we haven't seen the rain for a month or something like that.

337~~~
I'm impressed by his English.

338~~~

342~~~
We can drop the "2014" from the title an' all.

343~~~
Yeah but Barcelona is on the Mediterranean so the climate there is milder.

344~~~
"Now it's the best keeper in the world." Nice words about the DDG.

345~~~
Welcome to Manchester Valdes! Hopefully he can regain his former form and fitness. Sad to see Lindegaard go but it was obvious in the summer when it was rumored he wanted to go and in my opinion I just  don't think LVG rates him.

346~~~
Many people here thinks that he, after 7 months of injury, will replace De Gea who will be sold <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

347~~~
Very easy for a new player to say all the right things in their first interview but I thought he genuinely spoke very well.

Welcome Victor!

348~~~
Seems very strange that he'd come here just to be a back-up keeper.

Only reason I can think of that he'd willingly do that is if we're paying him an absolute fortune.

I'm worried about DDG, though to be fair both Valdes and LvG are saying the right thing....

349~~~
I agree.

Love your new tagline btw <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

350~~~
Don't be daft, I bet you can't show me one example where anyone suggested this would be a possibility. Nobody has even mentioned de gea for ages.

351~~~
I always thought he was a bit of a cnut, but he seems like a nice guy now that I see more of him. Really good interview, thanx for posting.

352~~~
Love it we've got probably the third, or fourth best keeper in the league and he's our number two! 

Great bit of business, now for a big fat transfer fee for Lindegaard.

353~~~
That has always been the tagline, it just makes sense now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

354~~~
Well 5 people in the poll on the homepage definitely think exactly that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

357~~~
A very handsome chap!  And he come across as sincere, likeable and passionate.  Im also glad he did not hide his feelings for Barcelona and suddenly claim to bleed red for our badge.  But given his education, its reassuring to know he shares the Fergusonian values of a never ending appetite to keep winning medals, no matter how many he wins.  That will endear him to the likes of Giggs, Rooney et al.

Listening between the lines, its obvious that his injury cost him a huge amount of ability and self-confidence and his rehabilitation is a serious long term plan.  I doubt very much he will be happy to be a no 2 keeper if he regains the ability and confidence he had pre injury.  

So this signing for us world well for both sides in the short term:  he is surrounded by world class players, trainers and facilities as he tries hard to regain what he lost and we get access to the best reserve keeper in world football.  

But unless De Gea leaves, I think he will leave us next winter, or latest in the summer of 2016.  And thats what I also hope happens, as that would mean r we retained De Gea as well as helped rehabilitate a world class talent and enjoyed his services during the period.

358~~~
Of course it has!  DOH! My memory lately. Im starting to get worried <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Is <a class="username" data-user="65209, @Barney" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65209/">@Barney</a> one of the others? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

359~~~
To be fair, that probably goes to Cech.

360~~~
What is it with us signing players that make you smile when they give interviews? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . 

I was never really a fan of Valdez but now I'm even happier he's here after that interview, seems a good lad!

361~~~
Proper fantasy football manager stuff!  

(Well I also signed Thiago Silva, Schweinsteiger, Valdes and Romero along with all LVGs news additions during my first transfer window in FM 2015 and won the league by 11 points)

362~~~
I'm thinking the same, his short stay is a thank you / getting himself on the shop window. Either way its a good move for both parties.

363~~~
I think your observation on the contract is accurate and the reasons you listed accurate.  Van Gaal talks a lot of people ethics - it's the kind of thing people like him and SAF do. 

Its in the greater interest of world football that a talent like Valdes comes back into the game.  But it needed mentor type sponsor to aide that process. 

Im surprised Barcelona did not provide him this service given the history they share and everything he did for them - anyone know what that is?  Or is it solely Valdes choice to complete his rehabilitation with us?

364~~~
I'd say that's most definitely the case here.

365~~~
What a beautiful man - we are building a seriously hot squad.
I might have to invest in a calendar this year.

366~~~
Pinch me im dreaming. Our first team is becoming more and more star studded by the day. Woodward really is transforming us towards a Gaalactico type team. if you said a year ago we would have Mata, di maria, falcao, victor valdes, and you would bet your life on another 3/4 to come.

367~~~
Just watching MUTV interview now. Cool as feck to see a Barca stalwart get all giddy about his first day training at Manchester United. A lot of us fans tend to take the status of the club for granted and you'd often get the impression on here that we're in a tier below other big European clubs. Nice to be reminded how we're actually perceived by a player from one of those clubs.

His English is excellent. Has he ever played outside Spain before?

368~~~
Cracking No.2. But the most important signing we can make this month is DDG. Lets just give the man 200k a week and be done with it.

369~~~

'in spain at 7pm we have sun and on the road with my friends but here that's not possible'.

372~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> great interview.

The more I think about it the more I wonder why he's here though. Glad we have him but massively wasted as a number 2.

373~~~
Enjoyed that. Seems like a humble guy.

374~~~
City have Cabella (spelling?) and chelsea have Cech, also Real have Navas (who could easily take over from Casillas, people seem to forget), and Barca has Ter Stegen developing under Bravo. Top teams have top back up.

375~~~
Maybe he learned it at school or in his spare time.

376~~~
Absolutely top notch news !!

Welcome Victor ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">He's so fit !!</span>

377~~~
What wages is he on? Surely crazy wages for a sub keeper!

378~~~
Newcastle have Cabella, City have Caballero. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

379~~~
now that he's signed, im absolutely fascinated to see how he performs in the cup competitions id imagine he will start in. he's a world class keeper.

380~~~
Our #2 is better than both Arsenal and Liverpool's first choice keeper.

381~~~
Right that's the guy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

382~~~
Looks like we've signed another great personality. We have a few really nice blokes playing for us.

383~~~
The only like for like situation imo is Chelsea's and I also think Cech is a massive waste on the bench. I'm sure he'll be looking for a new club.
To be fair Valdes said in the interview that it was important to be around friends in his recovery and maybe he just likes being part of the squad. He's achieved everything in football and has suffered a bad injury so maybe he's happy to take a role under less pressure where he can enjoy himself. A move to Monaco was hardly an ambitious one.

384~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

385~~~
Yes, that definitely is a great interview.

One thing that I found interesting is that Valdes always hinted at the fact that he sees his time here as a recovery process more so than a team to continue his career with. He's often hinted at the fact that he wants to fully recover and get back to his best whilst with us, and he's also indicated that he doesn't really want to disrupt the team dynamics that much. The fact that he seemed to understand "competition" as "thinking selfishly" hints to this. It's safe to say that he isn't really here as a replacement for de Gea if he leaves, though if de Gea does leave, I don't think Valdes will mind staying here and playing for us (though I doubt that de Gea will leave the club he currently enjoys playing in).

386~~~
Its hilarious the amount of people that have mentioned how attractive he is, as if that's some sort of criteria new players have to meet after signing Mata and Blind <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

387~~~
Happy for him. Would've preferred that he signed for a team where he'll start, but surprisingly nobody seems interested in a world class goalie.

388~~~
Seems a great guy. I think also its important we've bought another "winner" to the dressing room. He knows the game inside out and won't be phased by anything. doesnt seem like he is here to snatch de gea's position either, just maybe keep him on his toes.

389~~~
Liked the interview. Keen to see how he goes in our next cup match.

390~~~
not really we've gladly embraced Di Maria and let's be honest, he isn't exactly the best looking lad in the squad...

391~~~
Let him play a game first before we proclaim that lol. Given his age, injury, size and the fact that he's never played outside Spain makes me wonder how well he'll do here. Are there any other 'keepers in the PL as short as Valdes?

392~~~
<span style="color: #000000">Mitten:
</span>

393~~~
Edit: Scrap that apparently it's Allan McGregor who is the same height as Valdes. Speroni is 6'1" and then it's the likes of Schmeichel and Lloris at 6'2".

394~~~
Welcome, you handsome devil.
Great signing by the club. Will look great on posters and increase the female fanbase by 0.0016%

395~~~
Would love if he somehow fought his way back into the Spain squad, although Reina is an excellent cheerleader and Casillas appears untouchable.

396~~~
Which RedCafe poster said Manuel Almunia was a better keeper than Victor Valdes? Answer <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/victor-valdes-is-the-worst-starting-goalkeeper-for-any-big-side.237563/">here</a>.

*To be fair we're going all the way back to 2009 so I'm not trying to be clever, because at that time Valdes obviously hadn't stepped up his game. It's just fun to read and see some of the words some people used to describe him, now that he's our keeper ("tosswank" was my favourite).

397~~~
Jaysus, not a lot of love for Valdes in some of his RedCafe threads alright. Always thought he was a good 'keeper who maybe got underrated as he hadn't much to do during Barcelona's dominance, I could be wrong though.

398~~~
get the team a godin or a hummels and then another midfielder. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

399~~~
this. valdes as our no.2 is brilliant stuff.

but the most important thing is sorting out de gea's contract.

400~~~
Am I the only one who worry De Gea might leave soon?

401~~~
You must have missed a few threads.

402~~~
I liked that he said that after Camp Nou Old Trafford is the biggest stadium for him. Felt very honest.

403~~~
You must have missed a lot of posts in this thread because you definitely are not the only one.

404~~~
Seems like an all round nice and modest guy from that interview. 

I for one am still not worried about dave leaving, and Valdes seems like a great backup, with a great personality.

Plus its great for our Spanish contingent.

405~~~
I'm extremely impressed by Valdes' attitude after hearing the recent interviews.

406~~~
Happy that we have a good back up for David.

LVG made it clear that Valdes is number 2 and will be behind De Gea for 18 month helping him.

In fact it’s very clever from LVG. Valdes knows the famous philosophy and is totally in love with LVG, meaning that with Hoek and Valdes, De Gea will be even better learning faster with a good keeper like Valdes.

In the same time, Valdes had his knee injury “only” 9 month ago, he’ll take his time, recovering little by little, not playing a lot of games, maybe the FA Cup this year, and probably League Cup and FA Cup next year (maybe few games also around Christmas) but in fact he’ll go slowly with his recovering, and he’ll probably be top in a year.

He speaks a little English so it’ll help in the dressing room also.

407~~~
I've only read through the first few pages as well as the last.. my bad..
But seems to me overwhelming majority here are happy with this signing and confident De Gea will stay...

408~~~
It's unreal we have this kind of goalkeeper as a backup.

I believe Valdes has been one of the most hated/laughed at player on this forum, but I hardly expect any of his antagonists will dare to show up on a day like this. They'll probably bide their time until Valdes happen to make the slightest mistake. You people make me sick.

409~~~
I don't really rate Valdes, never have. Decent back up keeper, but I really hope this isnt to the detriment of De Gea who is only going from strength to strength, and by detriment I mean puts unwanted pressure on him, make him feel uncomfortable etc etc....however competition may force him into ensuring he knows he has to continue to keep performance level high.

So it could work both ways. I assume Lindergaard was potentially wanting away and therefore Valdes was required, like the fact LVG called him out as our no 2 goalkeeper.

410~~~
Yup. Just you.

411~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Well that was strong.

412~~~
Victor Valdes was Barcelona's no 1 keeper for many years. He gave his 100% for them and won honors on their behalf. At the end of his contract he picked a career threatening injury and in typical Barcelona fashion they tossed him away like some damaged goods. Manchester United offered him the facilities to train, get back in shape and return to football. Could it be the case that at age 32, he's happy to take a minor role with a club who actually saved his career and know what loyalty is? I mean its not as if the guy need more medals in his cabinet! 

This deal allows us to allow Lindegaard to leave + it will give Victor Valdes some match practice and the chance to rebuild his reputation and confidence. It will also allow us to loan our young keepers so they can gain the necessary experience to shadow DDG in the future.

413~~~
Except that is not what happened. Valdes wanted to leave and barca wanted to keep him. He actually stayed a year longer than he had originally intended.

414~~~
It was him who decided to leave for a new challenge.

415~~~
So he left despite picking such injury? That's strange

416~~~
Well he had agreed a deal with Monaco as he was in the last six months of his contract with Barca, he was playing brilliantly but then suffered an awful injury. After the injury Monaco decided to not go through with the deal (there is still a dispute going on regarding the agreement)  and Barca bought in two keepers. What happened was unfortunate but Barca can't be blamed for it

417~~~
It's a great signing as long as he's a Lindegaard replacement and doesn't mind being number two. It's crazy we are going to have Victor Valdes as backup!

418~~~
He told Barca he was leaving at the start of the season, so they could plan a replacement. In January he agreed a contact with Monaco(which they later reneged, apparently they may yet have to pay a portion of his wages for us, as the contract should be binding), in March he was injured, long after everything was finalized. 

I don't like Barca, or their shady business dealings, but how is any of this their fault?

419~~~
After reading his interview again, I think he is taking this 18 month to kickstart again his career. I think he trust LVG and maybe think this is the best place to train and play occasionally in order to reach the level that he used to be at. He is really taking his time. Seems like a patient guy.

420~~~
Carragher the joker …


EDIT: Just seen this … could be why he's so bitter:

421~~~
Dawwwww, the poor babby.... Perhaps we'll loan them Lindegaard, still an upgrade on their current "options".

422~~~
His attempt to do a Neville and become an impartial pundit aren't going to be very successful if he keeps taking potshots at United on twitter.

423~~~
It is obvious to me why Valdes is here. He's undergone a very tough recovery process and is slowly making his way back. As a proffesional footballer he could play till about 40 if wanted to, but with an injury like that at his age, he needs to recover and let his muscles build slowly over time. Heavy strain will increase the chance of relapse. The thing that he signed an 18 month contract says to me that he's here to  provide back up and rebuild his fitness to peak efficiency over time. When needed, he'll step up but he's not going to moan about being left out. He's won everything and doesn't have that career anxiety some keepers will have on the bench.

Plus, what better mentor to have in training with you than Victor Valdes?? De Gea and Valdes are very similar in playing style. Both are excellent shot stoppers and both and very good in one on ones. If ever De Gea needed some advice, you have Frans Hoek and Victor Valdes working with you, both of whom have worked together before and allowed Valdes to be a Barca great.

424~~~
Of course he's bitter, Victor Valdes turned down the chance to be Liverpools first choice keeper to be our back up keeper <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

425~~~
Don't blame Valdes. At United he gets job security as  number 2. He gets to work with the guys who gave him his first break and he gets paid generous amounts of money. Oh! not to forget the absolute honour of playing for United. So Liverpool were never in the race to be honest.

426~~~
He even posted this couple of weeks before:

427~~~
I don't understand that, it seems that no one wants to sign for them. (Di Maria, Sanchez, Shaqiri, Valdes)

428~~~
One think I've noticed with DDG is that he's a lot better coming off his line and one on ones, he's been doing the "sweeper keeper" role well when called upon, all of which was a strength of Valdes so it looks like he's learning all the time from him which is great to see!

429~~~
We have De Gea and Valdes, Chelsea have Courtois and Cech, City have Hart and Caballero... Arsenal have Sczezney (can't be bothered to check) and some kid. Liverpool have Mignolet and Brad Jones<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

430~~~
Arsenal has Ospina, right?

Brad Jones <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

431~~~
Yeah, spot on. They offered to give Valdés a temporary contract while he recovered, too.

432~~~
Ooh excellent point. Valdes used to do that a lot, but I wasn't the biggest fan of his sweeper keeping/ He's made errors before and I don't realistically see anyone other than that giant Neuer doing it right. Gary Neville did an excellent bit on Sky about De Gea's improvement. He waits more on the line and waits for the shooter to make his first move and then he reacts. It really is top class.

433~~~
So who was the 2nd keeper Carragher wanted Liverpool to buy other than Valdes to fulfill that criteria?

434~~~
Yet he contradicts himself here when doing a Q&A on the Sky Sports website! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>....Pretty desperate really.

435~~~
Oh yeah! Ospina! but haven't seen him do anything at all really. but Brad bloody Jones makes me cackle every time!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

436~~~
Well, there you have it, Barca couldn't have acted better in the situation. They had no need to make that offer to a player was walking out on them.

437~~~
Di Maria? When were they even linked with him, he's so far out of their price range that they shouldn't even consider it.

438~~~
Which is why I posted that statement after the colon as a quote … not sure what you're saying here?

439~~~
Typical Scousers mentality regarding our transfer business:

Valdes as free agent "Yes we should sign him, top clubs now have 2 keepers"
Valdes as Man United player "Normally you don't see two top keepers at one club" "Outfield players need to know who's No 1" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Remember Jones or Young transfers, it was all the same. King Kenny tricked us with being "interested" in Young, forcing us to sign him asap, so they could get Downing instead.
Also remember that they never wanted Jones, they tricked us again, so they could sign Coates who's twice a player.

Valdes seem to be a very good transfer for me.
Experience, winning mentality, plus he's the most decorated player in our dressing room - example for many young players.
Signing player of his calibre always bring a positive boost for everybody around, can't wait for his debut.

440~~~
Haha I know, I'm agreeing with you! Relax <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

441~~~
Can't relax … Muppet fever setting in!

442~~~
The Jones one was the best!

Scousers were interested in him...The next big thing, future England captian!...

We were on the verge of signing him, He's useless, over rated and over priced because he's british and Coates is 10x better...

Liverpool make a late attempt to sign him...Would be a great signing...one of the best young Cb in the world...

United sign him...Never wanted him anyway, too over rated!

443~~~
Sorry i spent too much time on the dailystar. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

444~~~
Hardly watch him play when he was at barca, but is he any good? 

Will he adopt to the premiership? 

Ddg struggle like hell in his first season here.

445~~~
Will he play in the fa cup matches from now on?

446~~~
He is the best ball playing goalkeeper, he has great reflexes but he is not very physical, so he will probably struggle with the PL physicality maybe more than DDG.

447~~~
I can't see much of a reason why he'd be granted the FA Cup games. If he's coming to the club as a backup keeper, that's what he'll be aside from the odd exception.

448~~~
Act you age, not your squad number!

Oh wait:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B66BTHiCIAARIR8.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B66BTHiCIAARIR8.jpg:large"/>

449~~~
See what gives me solace is that De Gea has played every game for us, including the two cup games against opposition much lower than us. Makes me think Van Gaal doesn't rate Lindegaard at all and just wants to replace him rather preparing for De Gea's departure. At least that is what I'm holding on to.

450~~~
Should hope to see him against Cambridge at least.

451~~~
I'm pretty sure that Cabella is winger/am for Newcastle.

452~~~
ESPN says he declined Juventus and Liverpool.  <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2233871/victor-valdes-offers-manchester-united-safety-and-security-in-net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...-manchester-united-safety-and-security-in-net</a>

These are truly the words of a man who knows he is in a delicate position with the fans:

Don't think I've ever before heard a new keeper say anything but "<i>I'm not here to sit on the bench, I'm here to win the no1 spot!</i>"

"I am not a problem"<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

454~~~
Amongst all the flurry of "will Dave be leaving now?" chat... we have signed a seriously experienced and talented goalkeeper to go alongside our no 1. This is fantastic news. His experience and confidence should be invaluable.

455~~~
Im thinking (or hoping) that having a very realistic threat to DDGs no 1 spot will spur him on to even better things. DDG is currently better than Valdes in my opinion but I think he could still learn a lot from Valdes and push himself further to improve. 

Im hoping the extra competition will boost De Gea rather than cause any issues. Anyway lets just get De Gea on a long term contract soon and then all fears will be gone.

brilliant!!

459~~~
It really does help having players who have that worldclass aura about them of winning the best competitions in the game, it makes training that bit more competitive and intense. It makes players up their game too.

e.g. Imagine a training match where one keeper has De Gea and the other has Valdes rather than Amos/Lindegaard. It almost feels like a Champions League final in itself.

460~~~
No strikers will want to sign for us, spending the year struggling to score during training.

461~~~
Thankfully we already have some of the best strikers in the world! And if they can score past De Gea/Valdes I'm sure they can score past your everyday Mignolet's, Szczesny and Joe Hart's with their eyes closed.

Exciting times ahead.

462~~~
My take on the gameplan is this; 

We want david de gea to sign a new deal and continue his amazing form.
Valdes is helped back from a serious injury and is signed as competition for dave but as of now solidly no.2, should make dave even better training with valdes.
This not only improves our depth and experience in the first team, but gives the club a security in case Dave either a)doesn't sign a new deal, b) madrid comes in with a massive offer and he wants to go c) combination of both.

If Dave signed a new 5/6 year long term deal and we lock him up for the long term, we wont pick up the extra year on valdes contract and he can move on to another big european club fully recovered with his stock high from playing with us.

Everyone wins here.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Louis van Gaal: Victor Valdes won't be happy as second-choice keeper</b></span>

465~~~
I can see him starting the FA Cup games.

466~~~
All of them? he might start the next one, but the later rounds against the bigger clubs would surely belong to our number one, De Gea.

467~~~
The next one and the one after I think he will start, but do agree later rounds will be for DDG.

468~~~
Début vs Cambridge?

469~~~
People saying he chose to be United's second choice rather than Liverpool's first.

472~~~
Could you make the font a little bigger please? Im having trouble reading it

473~~~

474~~~
He has tremendous reflexes so waiting for attacker to make the first move fits DDG. Valdes has played with Barcelona and I think he'll help DDG possession game if anything. Like you said, coming off the line would be a waste of his biggest asset.

475~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

476~~~
Long gone are the days where the scousers assumed that because a players nationality is Spanish he will automatically sign for them.

477~~~
I'm concerned about the recent influX of heavily tattooed lads.

478~~~
We had a quota to fill after Buttner left.

479~~~
I think it would keep DDG on his toes and provide him some rest through rotation!

480~~~
His interview with MUTV was excellent. Came across really well, good luck to him. But hopefully we only see him when DDG is rested for Cup games.

481~~~
Is this signing not just like the Falcao one, us taking a punt on a top class player who has injury troubles?

482~~~
Conducted in Spanish right?

483~~~
English, he speaks it well.

484~~~
Yeah, he only needed a translator for the end bit of answering one question, and even that bit he had pretty much said himself in English.

485~~~
Anyone else want him to start tomorrow?

486~~~
If he starts tomorrow there isn't much that would convince me otherwise that de gea is truly gone in the summer

487~~~
No

488~~~
Are you worried about us?? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

489~~~
Not this season. 

You losing De Gea would be good for Chelsea in the long run I think (not to mention it would be fecking funny on here!).

490~~~
Oh come on wouldn't it be great if 3-4 clubs are fighting for the PL trophy

491~~~
If it was Chelsea, Bournemouth, Brentford and Southampton fighting for it next year then maybe.

Arsenal and the two moneybags clubs from Manchester can frankly do one!

492~~~
Were they the three you supported before you settled on Chelsea in 2003 ?

493~~~
Just the three least objectionable clubs who may be in the prem next year!

And pre-2003? Surely there was no football pre-2003.

494~~~
I hope the 11 people who said in the poll they think he'll be first choice were just joking.

495~~~
Just saw it. Not bad at all. About same level as De Gea. Better than Anderson HAHA

496~~~
You funny! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Can you imagine the meltdown on here if he starts tomorrow? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

498~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

499~~~
No fecking way, I'd only want him to play if Dave is injured or in a cup game to get rest, other wise HELL NO!!!

500~~~
Southampton.

501~~~
Well I never heard playing occasionally could help reach highest level at all.

502~~~
He'll probably play against Cambridge - I'm looking forward to see him in action! Not full time obviously.. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

503~~~
Maybe not quality-wise. Fitness-wise. His injury is a really bad one. Getting himself fully fit should be his main priority at the moment.

504~~~
Coming from a Chelsea supporter! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

505~~~
I can just imagine him marking down an 'X' on his calendar with every day that passes and loads of arrows pointing towards 'Cambridge' at the end of the month. 

Even though he's obviously not our best keeper, I really want to see him make his debut.

506~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11356443/Man-Utd-news-Louis-van-Gaal-planning-on-giving-Victor-Valdes-his-debut-against-Cambridge.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ictor-Valdes-his-debut-against-Cambridge.html</a>

Ogden saying he's going to start against Cambridge.

507~~~
Would have been very surprising if he didn't.

508~~~
Probably the only interesting thing about our game on Friday.

509~~~
Dont want him to start!! Dave's our #1 end of...

510~~~
I think he needs his debut sooner rather than later. No better time than Cambridge

511~~~
Against Cambridge? Why not?

512~~~
How many people will be saying he should be number one then after he sets up several attacks for our team against Cambridge? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

513~~~
A tad bit dramatic no?

514~~~
I think De Gea is thinking about his career at UTD right now and I think we need to show him that we want him as #1. No disrespect to Valdes as his a brilliant keeper and his record proves that pre injury, as much as I'd like to see what Valdes can do now at UTD but losing Dave will be up there with when we lost Ronnie!!

515~~~
Somehow I don't think De Gea's future here hinges on him playing away to Cambridge in the FA Cup.

516~~~
Playing against fecking Cambridge won't determine De Gea's future here. Us qualifying for the CL next season will.

517~~~
Still cracks me up that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

518~~~
It's not going to bother him sitting out against bloody Cambridge <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

519~~~
He knows we want him as #1. Resting him against Cambridge isn't going to change that.

520~~~
If anything resting him against Cambridge will reassure him even further that we want him in tip top shape for games that actually matter.

EDIT: This comes across like I think De Gea's future will in any way hinge on the Cambridge game. I don't, just to reassure you all. Don't be concerned.

521~~~
All this talk about Victor Valdes being signed to replace De Gea is a bit odd. I may be mistaken but I seem to remmeber Valdes struggling to deal with any ariel duels he had to deal with at Barca. I don't think Valdes is good enough to be a #1 in England. The English style of play is exactly what Valdes struggles with imo.

522~~~
A bit overdramatic don't you think? Are you seriously telling me DDG is going to think he is not the #1 keeper for us if he doesn't start against Cambridge United, again Cambridge United. He has literally started even game so far this season. There is no thinking here. He has played over 150 games for us in a little over 3 years. He knows it, we know it that he is the future. Its up to him to make up his mind and stay. The fans love him and the whole world is raving about him. Do you honestly think LVG is going to drop him?

523~~~
I'm not saying LVG is dropping him for Valdes, I'm saying he is our #1 but since Valdes has come if I was in that position id think the club is preparing for if I leave. Its made his decision easier IMO that's all. Also all these reports about a swap deal with Bale, I know it's just speculation but it must be unsettling. First Valdes then Bale and you now what the reports will be if Valdes starts.... Just not liking the situation at the minute!

524~~~
I'm happy now...

525~~~
Actually the rumours of De Gea leaving started well BEFORE Valdes was signed.

526~~~
That's my point, it just adds fuel to the fire....

527~~~
No you said FIRST VALDES, so no Valdes was not first.

What fire?    A bunch of rumours?    If De Gea is the type to leave because of a bunch of rumours and not starting the odd game here or there, then we best be rid of him now.

528~~~
Who's saying he will leave on rumours? I'm saying it's unsettling when all these stories emerge and then the rumoured replacement starts!

529~~~
Disappointed he didn't start tonight.

530~~~
I was looking forward to watching him play and was surprised he didn't start. Any reason why? He hasn't picked up an injury already has he... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

531~~~
No he was on the bench. LVG knew that Cambridge would bombard us with long balls into the box and it would be their main means of attack. Throwing Valdes in against a team like Cambridge would not have been the best idea considering their approach.

532~~~
Yeah, it was bad enough for De Gea but he handled it very well. I don't think Valdes would of enjoyed that on a cold night <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

533~~~
The poor guy was sat there freezing on the bench. I think he'll get game when the UK is with sun.

534~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OTrTpJ2HBFr/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

Poor.

535~~~
Just beaten near post in under 21's game should've saved it reall
Get use to it, he is prone to many mistakes he is average at best as you will find when he starts to get games for us.

536~~~
Pisspoor defending. The shot was hit with a fair bit of power from close range.

And, you know, it's his first game in about 11 months.

537~~~
He's not average at best. Hes very good at best, and at times in his career, he bordered on one of the best in the world. 

That was a mistake but its his first game in how long? His positioning was wrong but don't use it as a stick to start beating his whole career with.

538~~~
What an absolutely shit ball to start that attack for 2-1

539~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

540~~~
He might get to play the Cambridge game. Can't see him playing many league games.

541~~~
OK, it's not so bad as I first thought.

542~~~
He was a great keeper, but even at his best he was prone to mental feckups.

543~~~
Hes a good keeper, but I have to disagree with that part tbh

544~~~
He was world-class and cut out his mistakes, but only last season before his injury. Before that season he was always prone to mistakes and I don't know if he can find his form of last season again.

545~~~
Sorry if posted, but high praise from Joyce and nice article. 

Joyce has always come across as a cracking guy and a good coach, I wonder if he will ever get to be no1 somewhere?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2928046/Victor-Valdes-inspired-Manchester-United-kids-heartwarming-tale-reveals-coach.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ted-kids-heartwarming-tale-reveals-coach.html</a>

546~~~
I'd have him at top 10, and probably at his best form top 7 at points in his career which would out him on the border of one of the best, but obviously that's my opinion. I think I rated him higher at Barca than a lot of people did. 

I agree, but they got quite rare towards his peak. But you'd expect that anyway. I think the early part of his career always stuck with him in the same way it took 3 years for England to realise DDG didn't actually have problems with shots from distance. 

Both your points are very valid but I argued against a poster calling him average which in my opinion, and yours it seems, is wrong.

547~~~
Great. Thanks for sharing.

548~~~
Have never really rated Valdes.

549~~~

550~~~
Motivational speech artist and quite experienced goalkeeper on every stage.

Great deal as for January. I'm still in a small shock we have Victor feckin Valdes in Manchester United.

551~~~
Let in a soft one last night.

552~~~
I'm still in shock Valdes, Di Maria and Falcao are at United.

553~~~
Well we are Falcao's biggest club so thats not really a shock

554~~~
He was never near the best in the world ffs

555~~~
He must have heard that Joyce was going to pick Anderson.

556~~~
Indeed and next summer it may even get much more insane if at least 50% of rumors/news are true.

557~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

558~~~
No doubt Valdes was amongst the best without ever being the best but he was up there in good company for most of his career. He was also very good last season and sort of made it known that he isn't quite done as a top keeper. That being said he's been out of action for almost a year now with a serious injury. We are yet to see how this has affected his game. Hope he does well.

559~~~
Yes he was.

560~~~
oh ok then. Serious revisionism on the caf of late.

561~~~
Well done for reducing your argument to a blooper reel. Could make one for every keeper who's been around as long as Valdés has.

He was error prone in his earlier years but over the past few seasons before his injury he was outstanding. That's not revisionism, and I'm not sure why I'd revise my opinion once a player signs for Man Utd...

562~~~
2-3 seasons at a high level (especially for a goalkeeper) out of a whole career doesn't make him near the best in the world. Thats my argument.

563~~~
Does for De Gea and Courtois though?

564~~~
So if he was playing at a higher level than Buffon at the time (which he was imo), you'd still rate Buffon higher than him because Buffon was playing at a high level for a longer period? He was one of the best at the time because there wasn't that many top keepers around (De Gea and Courtois were still really young and weren't at their current levels, Buffon and Casillas were on the decline).

It's a different situation for them and Valdes to be fair, they're both still at the start of their careers relatively, while Valdes was in his prime at the time.

565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a stupid comparison. 

RE Buffon, basically yes.

566~~~
That's a stupid argument. Someone saying Valdés being near the best in the world clearly means at one point in his career, not over his whole career.

567~~~
Obviously every keeper has a blooper reel etc but the amount of high profile games where Valdes has made mistakes stops hims from being in the top bracket imo

The best goalkeepers in the world over my lifetime win matches for their teams more than they lose them. Mistakes against Liverpool in Nou Camp, Drogba in Stanford Bridge spring to mind with Valdes straight away....

568~~~
This is what he was doing before his injury.

569~~~
Regardless of how highly or poorly you rate Valdes i don't think anyone can deny how immense he was for Barcelona last season. Unless you have no idea what you're talking about (not aimed at anyone in particular <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>). Talk to any of the faithful la liga followers and this would be a general opinion. Be fair, don't judge on just a few CL/classico/cup games you might have seen or just based on hearsay popular opinion as was with Ibrahimovic who many felt was overrated for a long time and their sample base was just a handful of games against english opposition.

Also for a backup goalie only Cech is better than him. AND we got him for free..

Could also include the goal Gibson scored against Schalke when Neuer was there, Gibson hit it right at him and he palmed it into the post and in. Shite keeping.

572~~~
I refuse to believe people could have watched him last season before the injury and not think he was bordering the best in the world (if not the best).

He was immense.

573~~~
Bit baffled myself. Usually agree with everything <a class="username" data-user="27209, @Decotron" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/27209/">@Decotron</a> posts too. In his last season (maybe two last seasons?) before that injury Valdes really seemed to step up a level and was clearly one of the very best keepers around. Outstanding with his feet, a great shot-stopper, quick off his line and very strong in one v one. Possibly not the most dominant under a high ball but don't remember many teams taking any advantage of that.

574~~~
Neuer's got a great blooper reel actually.

575~~~

576~~~
I love how humble our Spaniards are.

577~~~
Not sure if that's sarcastic wrt Valdes, but the others genuinely are <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

578~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

579~~~
You'd think if DDG was leaving, we'd want to at least play Valdes in 2 or 3 games to see how he fits in

580~~~
Not necessarily. If De Gea does leave then you would assume Valdes would have a whole pre-season of games to fit in. Plus he knows van Gaal quite well so would understand the way he wants to play.

581~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i57.tinypic.com/16bd5le.png" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/16bd5le.png"/>

Who the feck needs DDG when you have got a reserve keeper with stats like these? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

582~~~
Average rating seems about right anyway

583~~~
Solid stats, get him playing a full season and he'll get us 114 clean sheets!

584~~~
I rate him very highly (of course most would, I believe) and I would love him to be our GK next season should DaDeGea leave.

585~~~
I sure hope people aren't blaming him for the goal.

One thing I noticed immediately was that his distribution pales in comparison to De Gea's. I guess you can say that about a lot of keepers.

586~~~
Why does he have 3 clean sheets?

587~~~
Reserves?

588~~~
I don't think today is the time to judge him on anything, given he was thrown in and has had no competitive football for ages.

Looks like he'll get a start next week with De Gea's injury.

589~~~
Neville was, stupidly.

His distribution was immense at Barcelona by the way, probably just rusty.

590~~~
In one appearance?

591~~~
Neville loves to point fingers.

592~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> i have no idea then.

593~~~
I don't think VV was ever bought with the intention of him being #1. We'll still sign another keeper to play ahead of him if DDG leaves.

Didn't have any time to warm up today and I don't think we can judge him from part of a game, but even after watching some performances from the reserves he doesn't fill me with confidence yet. Distribution was a bit off in the short time he was playing.

594~~~
He was? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's atrocious from Nev.

595~~~
How tall is he? He looked short and slim when he came on.

596~~~
He wasn't really damning in his criticism in fairness, but did say he should have done better when I think that's expecting too much.

597~~~
I see. Well, there wasn't much that Valdes could to there I think.

598~~~
Neville couldn't wait to blame him for the goal could he? Embarrassing he should know better after all the stick De Gea got a few years back. He misjudged the flight and direction of the ball, it could've happened to any goalkeeper.

599~~~
What the fudge?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

600~~~
He comitted way too early, thats why he was caught out near post. He's been just as unconvincing in the reserves, some questionable goals let in. He's in a similar situation to Falcao, used to be good but needs to show he can still be good after his injury. Doesnt look close

601~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

602~~~
especially at keepers

603~~~
Some may doubt him, but he's undoubtedly got the highest posts per performance ratio on RedCafe. That's got to count for something.

604~~~
Fixed now <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

605~~~
Choosing Valdes as a replacement for De Gea would be a massive risk. We're talking about a guy who basically hasn't played first team football for well over a year (maybe more?). To then throw him into the deep end as our number one, regardless of his experience, is asking for trouble.

We need to hit the ground running with a top goalkeeper next season, not taking a punt on a keeper who is clearly past his best, with a question mark over his abilities following a long term injury.

All in (£150M) on Neuer I say <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

606~~~
Poor start from our new #1 in all honesty. He was unlucky with the deflection, but he committed far to early.

Hopefully he's just rusty.

607~~~
I though his distribution was one of his greatest strengths?

608~~~
Valdes distribution is better than De Gea for me. Maybe not on the quick ball for the counter, not so sure on that, but in terms of keeping possession particularly under pressure.

De Gea has fluffed a fair few kicks this season to the opposition down the middle.

609~~~
You're only saying that because one of De Gea's last bit of involvement in the game was a brilliant throw out to Ashley Young, and then when Valdes came on he didn't look as sharp. Overall and in general, Valdes has better distribution - although De Gea's is brilliant now as well so it's hard to compare to the old Valdes.

610~~~
Hopefully he gets a test at Hull so we can get a real idea of his ability against an eager relegation battling team.

611~~~
His kicking gave me butterflies. Low and too close to their players for comfort, though it is perhaps at least partly a function of the entire team looking shaky at that stage.

612~~~
I won't lay too much of the blame on him because he could be rusty. I thought he committed a bit too early though.

613~~~
Got to agree with this, it's very risky indeed considering how important it is that we make a serious title challenge next season. If Valdes has impressed van Gaal in training then maybe he will get a chance until January but yep, definitely a silly risk to take when we have money to burn in the summer.

If De Gea goes we might as well throw money at Bayern for Neuer and see what happens. They won't accept it but no harm in trying I suppose. Valdes is fine as back up but that should be it for now, though he won't hang around here for long if he doesn't get much game time.

614~~~
yup.should be a good test for him.

615~~~
Looks like De Gea won't be fit anyway so he should definitely get a full match.

616~~~
He was a bit unlucky to come on when we decided to play like crap. You could see a goal was coming in the second half we looked like we were in coast mode.

617~~~
His kicking was poor IMO. I think he did it to spite me, as I'd just told the bloke I was watching the game with that he might not be great with crosses but he's brilliant with his feet!

618~~~
Come on man, this is Victor effing Valdes. I'm not his biggest fan but he is at a very good age for keepers and knows what its like to be the number 1 for a big club.

619~~~
Valdes is a really cool guy, so if DDG leaves I want him as our GK. He's probably good also so that helps.

620~~~
For starters, do not think Valdes is that good anyway, a good GK just not united standards. He was dodgy at times for barcelona, and he got away with it allot because barca were insanely good. For VG does he want another shot stopper not better than our current one? its a a risk cannot be taken. It is vital we get a GK that can carry on straight from where DDG left off, if DDG is leaving. Yes Barca could not tie him down, does not mean oh he will solve our GK problems, and our defense is not very good last thing we want is our injury prone defense to have GK's swapped around

621~~~
You have to remember though, he has barely played in the last 14-15 months so it was always going to take a few games \ months to get back into the swing of things.

622~~~
This is why I was talking crap on this thread yesterday.  The excellent defensive record we've had this year was a result of having 60% possession in most games and De Gea being IMO the best natural shot stopper in Europe.  Even if players like Smalling have improved, our defence still isn't very good.  Every time there's a legitimate counter by an opponent, we're completely disorganized back there and it looks like we don't even train to defend.  Unless there are <i>really </i>drastic improvements in our defensive squad over the summer, we'll need a keeper who is a 1 for 1 in quality with De Gea.

623~~~
Valdes is not past his best. He was actually better than ever before his injury. Only Courtois was better in La Liga last season. We signed VDS when he was 34.

624~~~

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIwWlutcn7c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

625~~~
There's no keeper available that can carry on straight from where he leaves. Everyone else is a step down. Question is how much of a step down we will have to put up with.

626~~~
With Valdes, you will be always find something exciting. He will make some blunders, but he will also make some spectecular stops. He's very good in 1-1 situations, obviously as Barca always played a high defensive line.
BTW, he would rush to midfield to confront a ref or an opposition player. Either way, he is much more a personality that will always a have a love-hate relationship with the fans.

627~~~
De gea is going and even before his injury replacing him with Valdes would have been a step down and a huge risk. The injury only makes it harder for Valdes to succeed and how much it will have affected him is a complete lottery, we have to sign a new keeper this summer and let whoever the new arrival is and Valdes battle it out to be number one.

628~~~
I think he is/was a solid keeper, but I've never rated him as one of the top 2-3 in the world. Even when Barca were at their zenith.

629~~~
Was at a speeding awareness course the other day. Still playing a fast tempo game.

630~~~
I can't remember dates, but in the season before his knee injury he was performing at an exceptionally good level for Barca.

631~~~
What ever we all think of all our opinions, we do not want fans having a love hate relationship with a keeper, that alone is asking for trouble for VG. United just need a keeper who does his job like how VDS and DDG have done, we do not want a repeat of 1999-05 all over again, and valdes will bring back those god awful memory's. Bartez was exciting let us not forget that does not mean it was good, and look how that turned out? what made VDS such a top keeper, there was nothing exciting about him, he was efficient and knew how to dominate his area and do his job. Yes DDG made mistakes, but we knew that he was 20 21 so we knew that was coming, but we also knew DDG could become one of the worlds best keepers which he proven the case. Valdez makes mistakes, and he is not 21. At this level the line from success and failure is so thin, and we will go from a keeper that won us 20 points a season, to a keeper losing us 20 points a season. Barcelona masked his deficiency's, because they were that damn good Valdez could get away with it, at united not the case. DDG is also not far off VDS, not exciting but knows how to do his job. I would be very concerned with having valdes has our number 1, its just asking for trouble. The saying goes, the foolish man who built his house on sand, that would apply to united. You do not replace one of the worlds best keepers, with an ageing keeper who has not played top level football every week for over a year . Just because he used to play for barcelona, does not mean its good for us, and some of barcelona's defenders were not the greatest let us not forget

632~~~
He really wasn't. Not saying you are but the majority of people just think,

"oh well he used to be Barca number 1 keeper during one of their most successful periods so he must be good" 

In reality that couldn't be further from the truth, he's a bang average keeper.

633~~~
No its true, in his final season at Barcelona he was arguably the best keeper in the league.

But if you watched him for the reserves you wouldnt think it was the same keeper

634~~~
He was. Ask any La Liga follower and they'll tell you the same thing. Before the injury in the final season he was arguably one of their best players. But he hasn't looked the same since from the few times we're got to see him.

635~~~
He was miles ahead of everyone and it wasn't the first time, but it's trendy to knock down Barcelona players when they are not scoring 10 goals per weeks.

636~~~
Stats wise sure, clean sheets a plenty. But that was pretty much the first season where I was convinced that he was completely solid and better than the other keepers, like Diego Lopez

637~~~
Horrendous mistake and a world class save! De Gea of 2011.

638~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

639~~~
At the time he's mastered high balls, he will be close to his retirement.

640~~~

641~~~
Mixture of brilliance and a mistake in a few minutes. From what I've seen of him over the years, it seems fairly typical

642~~~
Thanks babe.

643~~~
I fairness to Valdes, he has no right getting to that. That's quite great.

644~~~
very worrying that we would end up with Valdes or Cillesen as no1 goalkeepers, there is certainly some chance it can happen.. this would be nighmtare

645~~~
I like him. He's rusty, and will improve. whoever we get to replace de gea should he leave will feel like a step down. at least with Valdes we know he has the experience to deal with being the no.1 at a big club and we dont have to spend 30m to get someone maybe a tiny bit better than him.

646~~~
Why do people think van Gaal fancies Cillessen? He wasn't even first choice for the national team, he only played because Vermeer hadn't played a match in months leading up to the worldcup.

647~~~
Valdes is class. 2nd game in 15 months, of course he'll need time to get up to speed.

648~~~
Sense.

649~~~
Dropped an easy catch, but the save he made from El-Mohammady was superb.

650~~~
I miss De Gea already.

651~~~
No just no please

652~~~
Really, really shaky.

653~~~
Yeah, not a United first choice keeper.

I'm not watching us go back to a flapping keeper - especially one in his 30s.

I hope he stays as back-up, but this guy isn't solid enough to push a title challenge in the PL.

654~~~
We're seeing why he's not a viable option here. Sadly in LVG's mind there are probably more pressing concerns in the squad.

655~~~
It's his first start in over a year in a new league. That too when the team has pretty much checked out for the year. What do you expect?

Remember how shaky De Gea was when he came from Spain.

656~~~
Didn't LvG mention that we had picked a replacement if DDG leaves?

657~~~
As a kid, yeah. Not a seasoned veteran coming off the back off an injury.

658~~~
He's never been good in aerial battles.

659~~~
Erm he's coming to a new league where it's a lot more physical and the game is a lot more aerial. What age he comes at doesn't matter.

660~~~
It does matter. It doesn't make sense to start investing in a 33 year old hoping that he hopefully improves that part of his game in a year or two. Also he is 183 cm tall.

661~~~
Jesus, his reactions are great.

662~~~
fantastic saves from him today

663~~~
Wicked save.....

664~~~
Yeah, his name is Victor Valdes.

665~~~
as he fancies Blind, Depay, RvP...

666~~~
Total agree , he has made a couple of high quality saves

667~~~
Great shot stopper, always has being.

668~~~
He is playing like DDG in his first year. Pulled off the odd wonder save, but was awful at crosses.

669~~~
Has a lot to work on in his aerial play, but on the line he's still phenomenal.

Too good to be an understudy, but I'm still not sure if I'm willing to trust him as the #1. He gets the benefit of the doubt for now, considering how long he's been out injured.

670~~~
Couple of fantastic saves and a couple of dodgy moments. It is his first full game for over a year, so he'll only get better.

Good first game.

671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The polar reactions on here today have been brilliant.

He's never been strong on corners, and he hasn't played in 15 months, so he will have rusty moments and not be strong in punching away.

De Gea was dreadful when he first came, which led our goalkeeping coaches to focus heavily on bulking him up and strengthening him in that area.

He has looked good today bar a couple of shaky moments which I expected. Then again, I don't make rash judgements.

Two saves today were sublime.

672~~~
Ideally we should be fixing the midfield and defence this summer to the extent that our goal keeper is not  troubled as much, and mainly needs to keep his concentration. Valdes is probably good enough for that. We're never going to get a like-for-like replacement for DDG.

673~~~
Very much de Gea in his first season.

674~~~
A real Jekyll and Hyde performance. He should surely know his limitations by now?

675~~~
Couple of good saves. Really good saves. Don't want him to be #1 though, his aerial ability is obviously not brilliant and will cost us goals regularly in the league.

676~~~
Needs to get used to the physicality of the league which is normal I guess, pulled off some excellent saves.

677~~~
Good reflexes for the save - but awful in the air and especially corners. Still got himself a clean sheet though.

678~~~
We would have lost today if not for his saves. We should be looking at our lack of penetration up front if we want to lam-blast anything today.

679~~~
A couple of decent stops, but looked as dodgy and error prone coming from crosses and making judgements as Mignolet

680~~~
Good shot stopping, shite at crosses. Can we afford to keep him and get him to work on his crosses next season?

681~~~
Why is he leading the MOTM vote when he nearly cost us 2 goals?! I know everyone else was shite too but c'mon...

682~~~
Needs to adapt to how physical the PL is, not so easy to come out and try to punch the ball.. But still got brilliant reflexes

683~~~
Those two dodgy moments were <i>really</i> dodgy.

684~~~
Stopped two sure-fire goals.. best of the worst imo despite his mistakes

685~~~
He reminds me of De Gea's first season...

686~~~
Two good saves and two simple errors when the ball was above waist height, pretty much what he's always been.

687~~~
Meh, I'm used to those sort of shots being saved these days <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

688~~~
It was obvious he was going to flap at the crosses. If he can work on and get better at them, I don't see why he can't be our #1 keeper next season.

689~~~
Did well. A little weak aerially, but if he's to be our #1 next season, I'm sure the coaching staff will make sure he tightens up on that. He made a very significant error, but he also claimed some crosses very well when pressured. I'm sure he'll be fine if we keep him on. 

Besides, it was his first full game in how long? Well over a year. If he was an outfield player, we'd be saying that he needs time. Valdes rightly needs a few games, but he's a good option to have if we lose De Gea. I'd rather not lose him, but to have Valdes to step in if required is a good position to be in.

690~~~
Flapped at a couple but also pulled out a couple of great saves. Not seen enough today to say he can definitely be #1 but that applies the other way too. Given his experience I'd say we should concentrate on buying outfield players over a new #1 when de gea goes.

691~~~
Correct. Sensible point.

692~~~
not trying to take credit from him from two saves but most of the goalkeepers in the league are capable of those saves, his aerial play is so poor, not good enough to be no1 goalkeeper, would rather have Lindegaard or Johnstone..

693~~~
Excellent saves; looked at sea defending corners and free kicks - par for the course for Valdes. He has never been very good in set-piece situations. Hopefully, De Gea will sign an extension or if he doesn't, then we go on and sign Cech. We can't wait for him to get used to the physicality of the league at 33-34.

694~~~
1 and a bit games in over a year. You don't expect he will be rusty?

Lindegaard isn't even close to his quality.

695~~~
Just because they're 'capable' of it it doesn't mean they'd pull it out like he did today, there's the difference.

I don't think we've learned much from today, great shot stopper, great reflexes but lacks in aerial battles. Most important thing for me is that it seems that he didn't lose his reflex after that break.

696~~~
Valdes was one of the top goalkeepers in the world at his peak, and his shot stopping was always a big strength of his. So you're doing him a bit of a disservice there. But yeah, he's literally not played competitively for an entire season, and the latter part/half of last season, I think it was? So there's a risk he might not get back to that level, though his reflexes seemed spot on today.

But in general, I tend to agree - the league is much different to La Liga and his aerial weakness will cost us, especially in his first season. So if DDG leaves, I'd much rather prefer a Cech, whose distribution might be worse, but his aerial game and suitably to the EPL is without doubt. But it would be difficult to say I'd prefer Lindegaard or Johnstone over Valdes IMO.

697~~~

698~~~
Good performance. Had a shaky start, dropping an easy catch, but made some really good saves after that.

699~~~
People need to remember he has only played 130ish minutes of football in more than 6 months.

700~~~
The fact most of us who rated him at Barca thought 1. his strength is his shotstopping and 2. he's weak with the ball in the air... won't have learnt much, but seriously those handling issues were worrying despite the stops.

701~~~
I don't know if I'm watching a different La Liga to other people. Maybe Barca don't cross the ball so much (though they still do a bit) but just about every other team will go down the wings, have overlapping full backs and put the ball into the box many times in a game. Corners as well, Barca will often take them short, but most, if not all other teams will lash them into the box, and goalkeepers are expected to deal with them. Valdes still did it plenty at Barca, and sometimes goalkeepers misjudge them, even DDG has done in recent times. DDG has definitely improved his aerial game, but it's still not very strong. His most prolific strength is his shot stopping and his distribution. Snap for Valdes. Age aside, it's almost a like for like replacement.

The way La Liga is spoken about when talking about Valdes, you'd think the ball is glued to the turf, and lifting the ball off the ground is a foul.

702~~~
Credit to him, he looks no different to before his time out. Mixture of good and bad.

703~~~
He was still dodgy, and United are still going to need a top class GK to replace DDG if he leaves, that is just reality. Lets not try and cut corners on such a crucial position, its the spine of the team and we need a GK that can take the mantle. Valdes is a good backup, but he is not a number 1

704~~~
Good point, I think he will naturally improve in aerial skills because they train differently in England than in Spain. His reflexes are good.

705~~~
Great point.

706~~~
So we just settle for second best? this has been a problem since 2009, we replace ronaldo with valencia obertan and owen, let the engine room deteriorate. If this club really wants to win the league in the next few years, then the no1 position must have a keeper fit for the position, or it will be 2004/05, 99/00 all over again. The thought of expecting valdes playing 45 to 50 games a season is a scary thought

707~~~
Two brilliant saves we'd be gushing over had de Gea made 'em, but he was dodgy dealing with some high balls into the box. It was a 2011 David de Gea performance.

708~~~
Made a couple of decent saves but my stance remains the same. 

Nowhere near good enough to be our number 1 and if he is then I'll be very worried going into next season.

709~~~
Same old Valdes though. Great shot stopper but horrible on crosses. Wrong league for him IMO.

710~~~
Yup. Agreed.

711~~~
and yet a lot of people want him as number 1 next season

712~~~
because he stopped two clear goals while nobody else created a decent chance all match. He was the player that earned us a point not the strikers, midfield or even defense.

713~~~
No, thank you.

714~~~
I see goalkeepers like Begovic, Adrian, Howard... pulling world class saves almost every round, from Valdes point of view it's a good sign he is still capable of refelxive saves but at 33 coming to new league, too late for him to learn it to some extent to be a reliable goalkeeper for us, and Valdes was always mistake prone I really don't like these goalkeepers but credit to him he deserved a clean sheet probably today..

715~~~
Why ? He's quality goalkeeper and is cleary more capable than Valdes.. and I was talking about this game or no2 goalkeeper never as no1..

716~~~
Great back up keeper.

717~~~
Clearly more capable than Valdes? Wtf? He never was more than a good mediocre goalkeeper, and Valdes is one of the best goalkeepers of his generation, a little behind the very best, but still. Both haven't play in ages.

718~~~
Because Valdes is far better than Lindegaard.

719~~~
there is a difference between a quality keeper, and keepers like Lindegaard

720~~~
wtf are you trying to prove here? Valdes one of the best goalkeepers of his generation? Are you kidding me right, but you have right to get drunk after game like that. I like Lindegaard as he's well composed goalkeeper, and I never suggested he would be our no1, just feel he's better than Valdes after so much time sidelined, he's so mistake prone

721~~~
He obviously needs a lot of game time. Not sure we can give him that though

722~~~
If we strengthen our back 4 not to be so reliant on the goalkeeper, sure why not? Before his injury at Barcelona he was having arguably his best season performance wise.

723~~~
Lindegaard is not better than Valdes, even if hes had a season out.

724~~~
Proved he's still a very good shot stopper. Will need to get used to the more physical side of the game if De Gea does go.

725~~~
As opposed to Lindegaard who isnt so much time sidelined?

726~~~
Saying Lindegaard is better than Valdes is the most ridiculous thing I've read here all year.

727~~~
He's always been dodgy with crosses so he'll have to work on that. 

He's still got the shot stopping. That one save to his left was really brilliant.

728~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was amazed too.

729~~~
It's not like de Gea is great at crosses. He only improved in a way that he waited and didn't try to catch a cross if he thought that it was difficult, Valdes can do that also.

He is shorter, which means that some balls he want be able to save, but his reflexes are really good.

On the other side, he is really comfortable with the ball, so it does ease a lot of pressure from our defenders.

Still don't know what to think, but if he would repeat performances like this, he would be good enough.

730~~~
Think if we get some proper defenders we could be ok with Valdes. It would give us some breathing space and we could have time to find De Gea's replacement. Seem's quite professional as well, I like him but it's difficult to judge him on less than 2 hours of play.

731~~~
The blips aside it was a De Gea type performance. Two outstanding saves. Certainly has a great future at the club if he can iron out those mistakes and maintain his fitness. Hoping he try and catches more in future.

732~~~
If the first one went in it would have been a keeper error. It was 2 feet in from the post

733~~~
IF Ekeke. That's the operative word. It didn't. If my mother were our fathers an all that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

734~~~
Should get another keeper.

735~~~
Didn't that happen to Chandler in Friends? His Father turned into a second mother.

736~~~
People doubting Valdes never watched Barca regularly, or his last season at the club. In his last season he was pretty much a one man defense.

737~~~
We'd be fine with him next season, its the rest of the team im shitting it about.

738~~~
I don't know, but did people actually watch CL or La Liga last 10 years? Barca doesn't pump the ball to the penalty box, doesn't mean our opposition also doesn't try that. He won multiple CL titles, La Liga and hardly there is any keeper in EPL who has more 'big game' experience than him. People here talk as if Barca's opposition used to not play high balls out of sympathy for VV or some other weird logic. He had 5 Zamora throphy, most by any Spanish GK. For a team as attacking as Barca, that's not bad.
People always say Barca's defence is weak and he's bad in crosses etc., So how come he conceded less goals than most other goal keepers in the league/CL? And if he can play against Athletico Madrid, he can handle physicality of any EPL team as well. Few technical issues could be easily worked by the coaching stuff. 

His financial planning is much worse than his handling of crosses.

739~~~
I'd be fine if we had him as number one. We have more pressing matters like midfield depth and scoring strikers

740~~~
Seriously, great reflexes but the coaches need to work on him. Treat him like De Gea in the early days. He's not a kid, but he's also not played week after week for a while and playing for Barcelona at that time, it's different to what he will experience in England. The saves surprised me though. Very quick but needs to iron out the kinks and develop a toughness. Also needs to look to catch more going by his punches <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

741~~~
Oooh what's he done?

742~~~
I would be fine with him as our number one next season IF we get in a younger goalkeeper in there that will be his understudy and gets some game time too.

743~~~
He was really really good that season. I had him down as one of the best around. 

Wee bit rusty today and will take a while to get used to the way crowd scenes in the box are refereed so differently but encouraging performance all the same. Reflexes looked very sharp.

744~~~
Valdes seems to struggle with crosses the same way DDG did, he can work on it close season.

745~~~
If he's good enough for Barcelona, he's good enough for us. Was always a no-brainer for me. He's an outstanding goalkeeper and just needs to get his match sharpness back.

746~~~
Going by his cat like reflexes there today I reckon once we bring in a top quality centre back to command the defence we'd be more than alright heading into next season with him as No. 1.

747~~~
It was a shrewd move to get him in just in case De Gea left, he's a good keeper and we won't have to panic in the summer over a replacement in case it comes to that. I'd be fine with him in goal next season.

748~~~
Probably the shrewdest bit of transfer business we've done in a very long time. At least we know he won't swan off to Real Madrid any time soon...

749~~~
I hate to be that guy but.. Our current keeper used to play for a pretty hated rival of Real too. Doesn't seem to be a road block for him.

750~~~
I wouldn't be totally outraged if we went into next season with him as first choice. He needs match practice of course, but if he can return to his peak levels then i'd be content to leave the keeper situation and move onto our other targets. Valdes at his best wasn't too much different from Cech post head injury or Lloris imo, and we'd only get stung by Levy anyway.

751~~~
I dont remember DDG being unable to catch reguarly though, I remember his opening here more for the fact he was too timid to come off of his line, as the biggest issue with him in the air.
It's been a while though so perhaps my memory is playing tricks.

752~~~
agree pretty much.

some great saves today.

753~~~
I remember that early DDG always seemed to punch it out or parry it (usually towards an opposition player who would bang it in). 

Here are his percentages of catches to punches, quite amazing how much he improved in that respect.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/NCpqgHH.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/NCpqgHH.jpg"/>

754~~~
It really is, when you consider the fact he comes out to claim a lot of the 50/50's now, more than he's ever done in the past, it's so fecking annoying he's devolped into the perfect all round keeper and we're now going to lose him.

755~~~
Im a little concerned about his command of the area when dealing with crosses. He's late on in his career so he could be unlikely to change dramatically in his composure, unlike de Gea who was/is still learning. I mean the guy has a compilation dedicated to his flaps for barca - not many other "top class" keepers have one of those. Juries still out for me but I hope he instils the same confidence across the back 4 de Gea did if he is our number one next season. He did make some good saves aswell against Hull.

756~~~
Was a bit surprised to see all positive comments in the post match thread. He made a couple of brilliant saves, but his fumbles could have easily resulted in goals if we'd been less lucky. Based only on this one match I'd be concerned. I never saw him enough to know whether it was uncharacteristic or not, but I didn't feel confident about him. Having said that I'd love to see him become solid for us

757~~~
That's because they would have gotten a younger and better one already.

758~~~
Yeah because they will have a player who is miles better and much younger.

759~~~
He has the quality to be our GK.

Don't think this is very true, if coached he would be very willing to change especially with his close relationship to LvG and the staff. He's a top quality GKer and can learn.

760~~~
Hang on, we're all missing the most important factor here...

Are de Gea and Valdes the two best looking keepers we've ever had?

Are they the best looking pair of keepers in PL history?

And which one is the <i>best</i> looking of the two?

761~~~
You must be having a laugh.  I give you Valdes, but De Gea with the atrocious Wolverine beard thing he has going on is nowhere near the top of that league.

Begovic has them both handsomely beat though.

762~~~
It's pretty normal Valdes what we saw today. Having seen his career and that today that's enough to fill me with fear at the prospect of him being number one next year. I imagine that would convince LVG he has to buy if he had any doubts.

763~~~
Lindegaard is better looking than De Gea too.

764~~~
Valdes easily.

De Gea looks like a goat.

765~~~
I'm just saying its a decent save, but he should be making it or else there need to be questions asked. The second one was a really good save and I'm happy about that

766~~~
The save from the header was the more difficult of the two.

767~~~
Yup.

768~~~
Valdes showed what a great shot stopper he is, but like a lot of foreign keepers he struggled with cross's and the physical demands of a typical premier league match, we could do a lot worse but if DDG is leaving then we need someone for the long haul, not a stop gap.

769~~~
That's where Valdes is valuable, he will buy us some time.

770~~~
In the "Who is the better looking stakes its Valdes by a mile. De Gea looks like Mr. Tumnus.
Valdes made some amazing saves yesterday. I'm not wooried about the couple of fumbles he made. Like De Gea he'll adapt to the Premier League.

771~~~
Please don't comment on Valdes until you have watched him (play) for at least 3 months.

Thank you.

772~~~
I don't particularly rate him, but he is the obvious option for no.1 if DDG leaves. There will be a drop in quality but the ones close to DDG's level are not available and the ones who are are not really an upgrade to Valdes. Put him in the gym for the summer to improve his strength and he should be fine next season.

Anyway, I don't know if anyone felt the same, but by some reason I always thought he was a bit of a cnut when he was playing for Barca, but now that I've seen more of him, he seems to be a really nice guy, I am pleased to have him here.

773~~~
He was definitely coming off 2nd best when it came to dealing with incoming crosses and he could have showed more of a presence in the crowded box situations but I think that can be worked on and improvements can be made in them areas.

I'm not to sure it would be as easy to improve the one area where he was really on the ball yesterday though and that was his shot stopping, a keeper either has that or he doesn't, it just comes natural to them and he certainly has the head and the reflexes when it comes to shot stopping.

There's another good 3/4 years left in him yet and taking into account the length of time he's been sitting on the bench, what I've seen of him so far, his experience and what he has achieved in the past, I think we can be thanking our lucky stars we have a lad like him ready and waiting to step in between the sticks full time if De Gea hits the road.

It would be well worth the risk ignoring the keeper situation for now, giving him a chance and improve the defense that would be in front of him instead.

you better do the same .-)

776~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'll trust Louis van Gaal and Frans Hoek on this.

777~~~
Look Valdes is good enough that a keeper iisn't our main priority for this summer. However, that doesn't mean we should pass up on someone like Cech or Leno should they become available because they're both better than Valdes atm.

778~~~
I'm in love with his distribution.

779~~~
Jesus Christ of Nazareth on a bicycle i have no words.

780~~~
No wonder you say things like that about Valdes, you only have one eye.

781~~~
He was world class for Barca last season and pulled off some wonderful saves yesterday but I think it seems pretty clear he's going to have a lot of issues with the aerial game in England. I'd rather we got one of those German keepers.

782~~~
Yeah that's clearly going to be a bit of an issue with him. It's not a slight on the chap because like de gea when he came here he's just not used to constant aerial bombardment. In this league you probably do need to be physically imposing as a keeper. Having said that you never how quickly one picks up stuff, although the height can be a hinderance.

783~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

784~~~
The thing is Valdés has always been the kind of keeper that likes to take charge of his area and we've already seen he's not fearful of trying to impose himself, but he really does just lack that aerial dominance and his handling has always been a little suspect. I think it's just a fundamental flaw in his game which would be heavily exposed here. He can improve on it certainly, but given the fact coming out and <i>trying</i> to take charge has been such a prominent part of his game for such a long time and he still hasn't mastered it, I'm not convinced we can rely on him getting it up to scratch. I don't think we can afford to have another couple of seasons of regular calamities either, particularly with a less than stellar defence.

He's a bit Barthez-esque, I think. Let's get Leno.

785~~~
Genuine question, what do you mean by handling? Valdes weirdly enough will catch the shots with ease but will struggle with catching crosses.
And about Leno he improved this season but he struggles with catching all type of balls, he will punch everything who comes at him.

786~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

789~~~
Well they all count Ekeke. I'm just concerned about his ability at crosses

790~~~
Valdes looks like Private Pile out of FMJ.

791~~~
Reminds me of early De Gea in that though, it took him awhile to adjust to it, but he managed in the end.

792~~~
van der Gouw wasn't bad!

793~~~
He pulled off some fine saves during the match and was quite rightly voted man of the match. I have no worries if he is to become number one next season if De Gea leaves. I do think van Gaal will buy someone else though and use Valdes as second choice however.

794~~~
Will start as no1 next season but in genuine competition with cillessen

795~~~
His shot stopping against Hull was on par with what we are used to from De Gea, world class no doubt, and to be honest am not concerned by the lack of height, aerial prowess and physical presence... 

De Gea is built like a worn shoe lace, never comes for crosses, never clears the box from corners, just man's his line and makes the save... alright he is pretty good at it but it has still lead to us leaking goals and has meant that our defense has been under sustained pressure which him catching and holding the ball would have alleviated.

I am happy that Valdes offers us more or less what De Gea does (other than youth) am only excited at the prospect of getting a keeper with physical presence, if it doesn't happen then Meh! Valdes is easily good enough, we have certainly managed with worse (cough Foster, erhem Taibi, hell Carroll and Sealy were nowhere near the Schmeichel, VDS level) and Lindegard is also pretty damn good, not top 5 in the world but if we had to manage for a season with either Valdes or Lindegard in goal I don't think it would define our finishing position greatly!

796~~~
It's not true at all that De Gea never comes for crosses or corners. He often does and rarely makes mistakes when doing so

797~~~
Agreed. Strange thing to say.

Obviously if De Gea does leave I think if Cech is in anyway obtainable it would foolish not to go for him. Ive had doubts about Valdes long before his debut for us. Im convinced he just not a "United keeper".

798~~~
Is this September 2011, and have we just lost 2-1 to West Brom?

As for Valdes, he is what he is. A great shot stopper but a goalkeeper with a penchant for flapping in his penalty area. If he can adapt to the demands of the Premier League then he'll succeed. If he can't, then he'll be targeted like a liability. Aerial development is generally easy for goalkeepers to improve upon, albeit making that transition at the age of 32 is very different to making it when you're only turning 20 (like De Gea was). 

Valdes is a gamble and his whole career here rests on his ability to catch the ball from a corner kick.

799~~~
Fecking eck seriously?

800~~~
I dont know if Cillessen can provide serious competition, i doubt it. We should get Leno, that on the other hand would be serious competition.

801~~~
I do think the whole crossing / corners / free kick thing is over played somewhat. 

The type of teams that put balls on the keeper for big lads to attack will do so regardless of keeper.  They will also have success regardless of the goalkeeper as a good ball and somebody as brave and dtermined at headering it as a Terry / Shawcross is basically impossible to defend.

The days of out and out wingers and two forwards attacking crosses are gone so whilst commanding the area and coming for crosses is one attribute required the importance isnt what it once was.

Plus, he's managed to get by with Barca with whom i am sure teams targeted set pieces. 

All keepers drop clangers, Valdes weaknes may well be crosses but i can handle conceding one or two from his errors as i think he's positives will counter those goals.  His shot stopping is excellant, he's very experianced at the very top levels, his distribution is like scholesy and (shouldnt really matter but) he comes accross as an aboslute top bloke.

My opinion if DDG is sign a promising young lad and make Valdes number 1.

802~~~
I would not be disappointed if he was our No1 next season or 2, if we got a decent young keeper to take over from him.

803~~~
I think it would be a disaster if he was our no1 next season, he is just not better than what we have got, like I have said he is a good GK in the past, never a great one, casillas would be a better bet than valdes and that says it all. He is just not up to standard, and would be perhaps one of VG's biggest mistakes of his united career if he made him permanently a no1, its a risk way to big to make. VG has not got a great deal of time here, if VG sees himself at united for no more than 5 years, he cannot dilly dally his way through the GK position like fergie done between 1999-05. It is one position cannot we cannot risk, and will not have that 20 point a season keeper.

804~~~
I dont think Casillas would be a better bet. And you say he's not up to standard, based on what? Based on 2 games he played for us?

805~~~
No from his time at Barcelona, he was just never that good. I think both Casillas and valdes are on that downward spiral, and it's a gamble this club cannot risk. We manage to finally get into the CL, I would be worried having valdes play PL FA cup and champions league games, with our current defence we are going to leak more goals without a top class keeper

806~~~
Had a great game when he played, but the mistakes he made are schoolboy stuff. Hopefully, he'll work hard over the summer on that aspect just in case.

807~~~
That's the thing though, if we strenghten up our defense he could be enough. With a good defense you dont need a WC keeper and you could do with a very good one which Valdes is I think.

808~~~
I disagree totally, it is far more likely he is going to make mistakes costing us points, and this is not taking a risk on potential. The risk factor hoping to have a strong defense with a dodgy keeper, is a weakness in the armor this club should not be risking and valdes will be dodgy. I would not want our 2 keepers going into the new season consisting of valdes and Anders Lindergaard, who have played in total for the entire season of 2 games. The GK position is has important has the defense engine room and forwards, and it would be a huge concern after losing DDG we risk it with Valdes. I do not see our defense all of a sudden becoming water tight, no matter the signings

809~~~
You dont know if he'll be dodgy or you think he'll be dodgy cause you dont rate him.. But yeah we dont agree. 
With a better defense I think he'd be good for us.

810~~~
He was making allot of mistakes for Barca, and quiet frankly vastly overrated by a few spanish experts. He was the weaklink in that team, they just masked allot of efficiency's. What would change at united? he is going to be in a far inferior team, a more physical league, do not think its suits to him. He is more of a La Liga keeper, not a PL keeper. Think it is wishful thinking he could take DDG's place, and this will show if he is replacing DDG

811~~~
Wouldnt say he made any more mistakes than other keepers. 
As for la liga or PL, I'm sure he would adapt.

812~~~
He made a fair few, he has hardly played for over a year, the clubs best bet is buying a new keeper. And at 33, it is a risk not worth taking especially we are not buying potential. Like I say, he is more suited to La Liga not the PL. I would rather the club start looking for a more commanding presence, than another shot stopper. I can very much see us chopping and changing keepers if it is Valdes and lindegaard, plus he has got to be eased in, not thrown to the sharks. The game time between Valdes and lindegaard last season is 2 games combined, now that is playing russian roulette with the keeper situation

813~~~
He made mistakes all the time. I've said this numerous times but when Barca used to dominate possesion in their tika-taka phase opposition would only have a few shots on goal yet he would always concede. He rarely faced many shots against him during his time at barca but he still shipped a lot of goals and a heavy number of them were from mistakes on his part. He was massively overrated all because he was in that barca team but he's not a very good keeper he's ok back up but under no circumstances should he be our new number 1 keeper.

814~~~
In Victor I trust. Double V will shine next year. <span style="color: #ffffff">I hope.</span>

815~~~
You watched a lot of Barca games back then?

816~~~
Playing for Barcelona isn't good for goalkeepers for two reasons, the first one it's easier for a goalkeeper when he is busy than when he only has few interventions, the other reason is that you are alone on set pieces there is only two or three players( Puyol, Piqué and Busquets) who aren't useless in the air.

817~~~
Rooney's miss after Valdes saved his penalty <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

818~~~
People arguing X goalkeeper is too weak or small but then supporting Valdes to be our first choice keeper confuse me. He's an excellent commanding keeper, but he's definitely too small to be as good as De Gea in the premier league. Hope he proves me wrong if he is our first choice.

819~~~
Yes I watched barca games EVERY week. He was an average player in a very good team.

820~~~
That doesn't fill me with confidence at all. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

All I see is poor finishing and a keeper that parries literally everything and is VERY fortunate as to where the ball bounces. There actually more fail videos of him than best saves which says it all.

I'll see your video and raise you 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3x_VxF1Za8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

821~~~
Nope.

822~~~
Haha ok.

823~~~
Not in the touring squad...thats a bit...weird?

824~~~
Its strange.

825~~~
Very, very weird. Didn't his agent come out and say that he isn't moving?

826~~~
Yep.

So either we're convinced De Gea wont be going anywhere, or we've got someone else lined up. Unless he's injured?

827~~~
It can only mean he's on his way. Van Gaal mustn't be convinced.

Another to join the exodus to Turkey maybe.

828~~~
Has he been at training so far?

829~~~
who's the reserve keeper then?

830~~~
Lindegaard and Johnstone.

831~~~
Lindegaard + Johnstone.

832~~~
Johnson and Lindegaard

833~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Im stuipid at times.

834~~~
Could be an injury I guess. I am suspecting that might be the case.

835~~~
I can't imagine him leaving. I think he will play even if de gea stays. Valdes is a good keeper especially if we add Ramos/otamendi then we can do well with him as first choice too(if de gea leaves that is).Unless he is offered immense wages elsewhere and is tempted I will be very surprised if he moves away.

836~~~
Injured or for sale?  Surprising, given he would appear to be our 2nd choice keeper.  I'm surprised Lindegaard is being taken along as we wanted to let him go and he wanted to go...

837~~~
I'm really surprised.

838~~~
According to twatter, his agent has been hawking him to Real Madrid as a stop gap until DeGea arrives next season

839~~~
Yeah like Valdes would go to Madrid. 
I mean I think he wouldnt. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

840~~~
Get them to pay 10 mil for Valdes as a stop gap, immediately sign DeGea to New contract.    What an unlikely plan!

841~~~
I am sure at this stage of his career he doesn't want to be sitting on the bench so either de gea will see out the last year of his contract or vales has been told we will sign someone else as our new number one.

842~~~
Probably been told that even if De Gea leaves, we'll be getting a new number 1 in, so probably looking for a new club.

843~~~
I found it strange that he joined in the first place. Seems a nice enough guy and clearly is a talented player...but he can do better than United's bench. He should be playing every game for someone while he can.

844~~~
Maybe he joined thinking he would be #1 when De Gea left, but after watching him train and play van Gaal isn't convinced about him.

845~~~

846~~~
Robin then Victor, who would think

847~~~
I believe that it was all planned out a year ago. We will give Valdes the treatment only a top club can give and he will end up leaving for a fee

848~~~
Good decision. I don't mind that we gave him the treatment and the opportunity to recover from a serious injury at a top club but he should never be considered to be our number one. He should do fine in Turkey or some similar league.

849~~~
He must be leaving for sure. Even if he wasn't going to be no. 1 after De Gea, he would still be a better no. 2 than Anders or Johnstone. 

Most likely he was told that ha isn't going to be no.1 even if DDG leaves and he decided to go somewhere where he will be.

850~~~
So if he's apparently not good enough for us and he's off, we either have someone lined up to replace him, who's currently a no 1 and will be our no 1 too, which suggests De Gea's departure is expected (in which case who is the mystery keeper we are bringing in?), or we have a no 2 lined up who'll back up De Gea and eventually take over (can't see that happening - Begovic has gone already) or we are 100% sure not to sell De Gea and we'll back him up with Lindegaard for this season before they both go, leaving us to go after Lloris next summer.

851~~~
Why not, though? If he rediscovers his old level he's better than any realistic transfer target.

852~~~
Don't get it tbh, you basically have a free world class keeper (if he can manage to get his form back).

853~~~
He really isn't. He was never world class, except maybe on one on one situations. He also had a very serious injury and he's 33; it would be an insane gamble to make him first choice. 

I'd rather have Lloris or some young keeper with potential. I'd even have Begovic ahead of him but now he's unavailable of course.

854~~~
You do know that VDS was 34 when he joined United right? 33 is still young for a keeper.

855~~~
I didn't rate him that highly for many years but during his latter years at Barca he had definitely developed into a top-class goalkeeper. At least on par with Lloris and much, much, much better than Asmir Begovic. Are you saying that Begovic is better than Valdes ever was?

I have previously advocated buying Begovic as a fall-back option. We could then start Valdes and give him a chance at rediscovering his old form, and if that doesn't work, Begovic would be a perfectly decent plan B. I just think it's a waste to spend 25-30 million on a new goalkeeper when we have a potential top-class keeper already in the squad.

856~~~
We should sell him to Real Madrid.

857~~~
Keep DDG this year and get some other nr. 1 next season if Valdes is indeed leaving.

858~~~
Wages.

859~~~
I hope it's injury. I think Valdes could do a decent job if we get in a top class CB

860~~~
No, but he doesn't come off the back of a career-threatening injury and thus he would have been less of a gamble. 

Just like Benteke would have been a safer bet than Falcao even though Falcao was miles ahead of Benteke at his peak. Not that I want Benteke but that's not the point.

861~~~
But he didn't tear his anterior cruciate ligament at the age of 33. The older you are, the harder it is to recover from injuries like that.

EDIT: Also, not everyone is VdS. Look at how quickly Casillas declined and he's 34...

862~~~
I like this development.

Never understood why so many thought he should replace De Gea, it would have been a massive downgrade on our best player. Don't mind him as a back-up but I was happy with Lindegaard in that role and we don't need both.

863~~~
I would have given him a pre season. Surprised, maybe he just isnt good enough, like Falcao. They see him every day, so i dont know whats going on. 

I just hope we dont go for Cillessen, thats just my opinion

864~~~
Could be leaving for Valencia. Valencia desperately need a keeper as Diego Alves is injured for 6-7 months and the backup keeper is also injured. Neither will be fit in time for CL qualifiers.

865~~~
Valdes not looking like he's interested in leaving

866~~~
There were lots of reports saying Lvg and hoek are real happy with Valdes development. Lvg doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who will sign someone to get resale value. Plus United aren't exactly strapped for cash that they need the pittance that valdes transfer brings

867~~~
Whenever there will be first press conf from USA, Valdes topic will definitely come up and we will find out he was left behind. It will be weird if Valdes posted that tweet if he is to leave in few days.

868~~~
While he could be leaving there are other reasons as to why he didn't travel -

General:
Fitness regime 
Intensive coaching 
An agreement in the face of a DDG PR stunt
Unknown injury

Personal:
Family reason
Bereavement
Visa issue
Personal request

Etc etc. 

Only the press conference will reveal any details accurately.

869~~~
or lvg knew valdes well enough and sanctioned valdes doesn't need the tour.  at his age and injury record it's better to avoid the unnecessary travel and stay in carrington to get back his full fitness asap.   we know lvg, he could think and plan things out different from most people do.  let's see what would he say in the upcoming press conf

870~~~
That instagram post doesn't sound like he'll be going anywhere and I doubt it is just coincidence he posted that the same day as the reports he was left home.

871~~~
I have accepted losing DDG but losing Valdes? we haven't even given him a chance, for all we know he could be a solid replacement for DDG for the next 3 seasons.

872~~~
Yeah his tweet makes me think he's perhaps carrying some sort of injury, or something that would mean he'd get more benefit staying behind and working at Carrington.

873~~~
I think if DDG leaves, Valdes stays. Otherwise he goes. Given how much LVG likes him you would expect he would give him the chance at No. 1 if it was available.

I think the whole Tour arrangement is a challenge to Madrid, and DDG hasn't decided to leave yet. But, he hasn't committed to us either, and Valdes will stick around until he does.

874~~~
May be like Barthez last season with us, trying to stick around and change the managers mind when he's already cut you out in his thoughts.. I guess we won't know fully until someone point  blank asks LvG about his situation next press conference form the States.

875~~~
Maybe he's on some kind of program that requires him to skip the tour.

876~~~
His thumb looks blue as feck.

877~~~
Errrrm errrr....did he just miss the plane or something then? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is all very strange.

878~~~
In agreement with the folks who are saying he's most likely in rehab due to a pre-existing (or new) injury thus he was forced to miss the tour.

879~~~
Him not going to the US because hes an FBI fugitive sounds more logical then him being left out by LVG for transfer.

880~~~
Isn't that some kind of bandage on his arm?

881~~~
Still a top class keeper. Wouldn't mind him having a shot at No 1 if DDG does indeed go.

882~~~
That instagram post clears it all up given that footballers never lie.

883~~~
And a big bruise running up to his thumb?

884~~~
Good spot.

885~~~
Definitely looks like it. Completely understandable for him to have been left behind for some rehab then!

886~~~
This just shows you have never seen Begovic keep. Begovic is in the top 6 in PL and is better than Valdes at the moment. Begovic ball catching ability and not flapping at it with command in the box is better than Valdes. Valdes will look a calamity at Utd with this defense especially during set-pieces.

887~~~
Hope he stays, could be very good if he handles long balls/crosses better

888~~~
Looking forward to his contribution this year, whether on the pitch or in the dressing room. The experience of a 3x CL winning keeper is always welcome.

889~~~
I can't argue with that.
But VDS was never released by his club - he was always a wanted man and played constantly.
Valdes hasnt played competitively for a long time now (except for a few games at the end of last season). 
I remember when he came on once DDG went off against Arsenal, and 5 minutes later we conceded a goal. This is a fact. Could he have saved....thats open to discussion.

Lets also not forget that Valdes was decent while at Barca. Just like Falcao was decent at Athletico. Just like RVP was great for us 2 years ago.
Unfortunately, time moves on and the ability of player also changes, with time. At present, I dont trust Valdes. I dont trust Falcao and I dont trust RVP.

890~~~
I agree with most, although you may be forgetting that Louis and Hoek did see Valdes for the whole of last season during trainings. So they know much more about his level and fitness than if we got him straight out of injury just like Falcao.

891~~~
Begovic has been pretty rubbish this last year. There was a run mid season where he was costing them a goal a game through stupid mistakes.

892~~~
Neither Valdes or Begovic are good enough. But Begovic wouldn't be the unmitigated disaster that Valdes would.

893~~~
Perfect back up option who can easily challenge De Gea or any keeper in the world with his Barca experience.

894~~~
I believe that was a run of 2-3 games in 5 years. Ask any stoke fan as to how important Begovic was to them for those clean sheets.

895~~~
I do, regularly. Half my family is from Stoke and i watch most of their games that dont clash with ours. He was brilliant last season but many fans wanted him dropped for Butland at one point in 2015.

896~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

897~~~
It's not strange

LvG is not a fan of this tours, probably Valdes need another kind  of training regime.

LvG could think that he will improve more his fitness staying in Manchester

898~~~
VDS was an entirely different goalkeeper to Valdes anyway, being lightly built and 6'6" puts off the effects of age as well as is possible for a keeper, hence why Buffon is only now slowing down.

899~~~
such a tease!

900~~~
He's on his bike then by the sounds of that.

901~~~
Valdes is in the doghouse then. What a twitter teaser.

902~~~
"Sammy, guy got injured by dropping the aftershave bottle to his right foot"

903~~~
Sounds like he came back unfit. We know LVG hates fatties, as shown with his treatment of Shaw .

904~~~
They told him nothing and he was surprised like everyone else.

905~~~
If Luckhurst has been hearing things then somewhere on the internet there will be some meat to add to this bone. The Red Issue lot are generally pretty good with this stuff.

906~~~
Hmm is it really a massive deal if a goalkeeper comes back slightly more unfit then he should be? If it is to LVG then fair enough and its a fair punishment perhaps. Id be pleased personally if he does stay. I doubt the intention was always for him to leave otherwise im sure we would have been more interested in Cech. I reckon we will sign a decent goalkeeper who has potential but will be made to prove himself battling Valdes for the number one spot. Cillessen maybe or Leno?assuming De Gea lives obviously.

907~~~
Not sure what people expect really.Maybe he should post something like "Feck Van Gaal he told me if I stay I will be 4th choice.Can't wait to throw this United shirt into the bin".

Even if he's going to leave us soon it's professionalism not to suggest anything about the move on social media.

I think he's not fit.Not travelled with the U21s 2 days ago as well.

908~~~

909~~~
Van Gaal confirms he's as good as gone. He refused to play for the second team last year as well.

910~~~
Posted in other thread:

LVG was asked why Valdes is not on the tour, Louis says he doesn't follow my philosophy so no place for one player. Philosophy is how you play football and how you maintain your match rhythm. Last year he refused to play in the 2nd team. That's one aspect but there are others.

Says there is only one way and that is out. Confirms he is being sold. Big disappointment for us. We thought he'd follow out philosophy. It's a pity cos we've given opportunity to rehab then given a contract. When you don't play in 1st team you have to play in 2nd, every player has to play that and he refused that.

Picked in last game to help him and to show his qualities for another club.

911~~~
He's gone.

912~~~
Good.

913~~~
Kinell...that was savage. Adios.

914~~~
Think its fair to say I was wrong about Valdes being our new #1 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Sounds like LVG is incredibly angry and disappointed with him. And I don't blame him

915~~~
Aaaand he's gone.

916~~~
Happy he is being sold. Never was good enough for us, and whoever was saying he was world class at some point was massively overrating him.

917~~~
so that guy from MEN was right with Valdes and what he heard about him. LvG killed him there. Brutal, but deserved.

918~~~

919~~~
Well... that's that then.

920~~~
Van Gaal is Fecking ruthless. No messing about.

921~~~
Yeah hes gone

922~~~
Disappointed in Valdes, what does he expect other than reserve football when he's barely played for over a year?

923~~~
Boom. That was brutal.

924~~~
Good riddence. Looked dodgy for the reserves, when he actually bothered to play

925~~~
Feck, that means we'll probably have to sign two new goalkeepers? Also weakens our position when it comes to negotiating for a new one...

926~~~
Van Gaal rules with an iron fist. I am starting to see more of his known assertiveness the past few months. Dropping Di Maria, making mass changes, this valdes situation, playing hardball with Madrid over De Gea and others.

927~~~
What a fecking dickhead

928~~~
RvP, Rafael

929~~~
Some bullet we dodged there.

930~~~
Even Falcao played for the reserves. 

Lindergaard?

931~~~
Valdes not looking too great right now. Maybe that's why we are so reluctant to sell De Gea.

932~~~
Anders is still here, no idea why people think we need to sign 2 keepers

933~~~
What do you expect? He's always been a total shitehawk and a bit of a liability. I'd rather have Casillas as a replacement than him.

934~~~
Wow, that's pretty honest from LVG. Could easily have put that in more diplomatic terms, but if Valdes refused to play with our U21s to keep match fitness (or rather, regain it) he really deserves it. What was he expecting? LVG clearly expected more of him as a person.

935~~~
Considering their previous relationship, I reckon that attack was because LVG is personally quite hurt by what Valdes has done.

936~~~
And he basically confirmed Sergio Romero is on his way.

937~~~
We dont want to sell him, nothing to do with Valdes

938~~~
Well that was blunt. If De Gea goes we are in a fecking awful position.

939~~~
It's also this iron first which usually sees him getting sacked about 3 years into his contract -- he usually goes too far. Managerial genius, but a bit of a nutcase by all accounts.

940~~~
Wow, thats brutal and probably deserved from VG there.

941~~~
He did? I missed that part.

942~~~
Yea, that falls under the massive changes he is making to our team. He certainly is shaking things up at United.

943~~~
Wow.... LVG takes no shit

944~~~
I'm not familiar with his personality/background? I rate him as a keeper though.

945~~~
refusing to play in the stiffs after a year out, on a huge wage, with the prospect of being number one if de gea f**ks off.

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

946~~~
LVG already said that Lindegaard doesn't really fit his philosophy though and it doesn't seem like those sort of players last too long.

947~~~
Well, that's that then. Ruthless.

948~~~
I missed that part, what did he say?

949~~~
No Valdes makes me think we won't sell even if Madrid offered Ramos or a world record fee for a GK.

950~~~
He's a flip-flapper, can't deal with crosses and he's always had a bad attitude, getting in the mix in the Clasicos.

Edit: He also had an altercation with Mourinho when Inter beat Barca and Mourinho wanted to go and wave to the fans. He's a knobber.

951~~~
Poor from Valdes, we helped him recover, he should have been a pro about it and then piss off in the summer. You sign for a club that has DDG, what did he expect?

952~~~
Just yesterday, Van Gaal really doesn't give a feck.

953~~~
That its a process. He basically confirmed we've contacted him.

954~~~
I remember one of his teammates, Puyol I think, say that he was despicable on or around the training ground, a top guy outside but his arrogance knows no boundaries when it comes to football.

955~~~
Too late, once you feck with Louis, it is over.

956~~~
This season will really tell a lot about Van Gaal future at United. We have a great squad, so expectation should be high.

957~~~
feck Valdes, I was a big fan of him but if you're not following the philosophy you get no love from hbgreg.

958~~~
When did that happen?

959~~~
Very strange situation. We signed Victor Valdes for 2 games

960~~~
LVG gives me the feeling that he would disown his own kids if they did not follow his philosophy.

961~~~
Really surprised with that. Always heard his work ethic is outstanding and thought he'd be a good leader around the squad at least. Evidently not.

962~~~
It didn't. He dodged the question.

963~~~
Don't joke with LvG

964~~~
If he refused to play for the reserves I am guessing it would've been very early on after he arrived. So why did he continue to put him on the bench and only now cut him off? He could've given those opportunities to someone that would've benefited from the experience and that we could plan around. Something doesn't add up here.

965~~~
We signed him as cover for De Gea. When your number one only misses one game through reason your number two will always struggle for minutes.

966~~~
Romero it is.

967~~~
Refused to play with U21 probably

968~~~
Didnt he answer that one with - you write rubbish. Dodging a question doesnt mean Romero is coming.

969~~~
wtf poor Victor doesn't even know <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

970~~~
Why would it make a difference? He wasnt good enough. If we sell DDG we'd buy a good goalkeeper to replace him not one that can be replaced by Sergio Romero

971~~~
Two players who had a very good relationship with Van Gaal now binned. Ruthless.

972~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/dzyrUl2.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/dzyrUl2.gif"/>

974~~~
Wasn't the rumour that Monaco were paying a large part of his salary? Probably made sense as a low risk move if so.

975~~~
Regarding Romero LVG said something like "I cannot answer that. Maybe you are right. Maybe you are wrong"

976~~~
I know I'm agreeing with you.

977~~~
Not the first time this summer. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

978~~~
Reports coming in that Geoff Shreeves is on his way to tell Victor the news.

979~~~
I think LvG expected him to follow his philosophy initially. Our manager wouldn't have signed him if he knew Valdés wouldn't.

980~~~
I really don't think he was ruthless at all, just honest.

981~~~
Guess this is our first Van Gaal fall-out. We knew they happened sometimes when he didn't feel a player was able to take instruction. I'm just glad it's someone none of us really give a feck about.

982~~~
Hm. The question has to be what the hell the expectations were on both sides before he signed. Sounds as though he's been on Aloysius' bad side for a good while.

Odd business. But good riddance. Definitely seems like he's been acting quite the twat here.

983~~~
Man, Van Gaal is ruthless. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

984~~~
I know you are. Second sentence wasnt for you. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

985~~~
Imagine how Valdes must be feeling right about now having watched that from England/Spain or wherever he is. Surely he must've known what LvG said, at least I hope he didn't find out by watching the presser.

986~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

987~~~
i feel a bit indifferent to this. don't really care. surely when he was signed LvG would of told him he was going to be used this way?

988~~~
Eating your greens is the number 1 rule in the Van Gaal family philosophy.

989~~~
One thing this Valdes + RvP (to a lesser extent) business does is make sure everyone is left in no doubt that they will be dropped and/or shipped out if they don't toe the line (it was RvP's age tbf, but people were unsure due to his relationship with LvG). 

We've needed this kind of ruthlessness ever since Fegie left -- maybe even a year or two before he left.

990~~~
Thanks for your debut against arse.

991~~~
De Gea's not going anywhere if we don't want him to. We've played the whole thing beautifully with the Ramos stuff, and by all accounts are now well in control of the situation.

We've got the edge in that De Gea is too much of a professional to act up because we're refusing to sell him, whereas Ramos is the sort who will cause all sorts of trouble if he's unhappy. Plus we know that next summer we'll want the same things, we'll have the same CEO, same manager, same strategy and financial directives. Madrid don't have a clue what's going to happen to them from one season to the next.

992~~~
Well I guess it's a shame we've missed out on Begovic then.

993~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

994~~~
You have to be ruthless and Valdes should know better than most that LVG would not put up with any shit

995~~~
We're being linked with Romero in the past few days.

996~~~
And if for whatever reason we didn't manage to sign a replacement keeper for DDG, we'd be left with just Lindegaard. Worst case scenario with Valdes as our number 1 isn't that bad, he's still a very good goalkeeper.

997~~~
Also reports about bidding for Oblak might not be far off the mark

998~~~
Good riddance.

Not good enough to replace De Gea and if he's refusing to play games after we gave him a contract and paid for his rehab after Monaco rejected him then his attitude isn't even good enough for him to be a part of the squad.

Plus it's always a positive to have another Mendes client off our books.

999~~~
maybe hes going over to liverpool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1000~~~
So next year it's either a new keeper of LvG/Hoek choice or DDG in goal. Very happy with that.

1001~~~
He wasnt any better than Lindegaard, when he actually bothered to play for the reserves. He was letting in weak goals at that level let alone for the first team. All we've lost is a name

1002~~~
You need to start being more vocal about De Gea leaving, with your track record he'll get special dispensation to sign 15 year deal.

1003~~~
Yes, I've seen that. Not seen that much of Romero to judge whether or not he'd be good for us though.

Obviously seen Begovic many times and think he's a quality keeper, perhaps even as our number 1.

1004~~~
where's this come from?

1005~~~
Bloody hell. Timing is a bit odd, but the philosophy uber alles.

1006~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1007~~~
He played only one/two times for the U21 if I'm not wrong

1008~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1009~~~
Victor Valdez is the new Neil Webb.

1010~~~
Easy come, easy goes with backup keepers sometimes. We once had Tony Coton for six months and I don't think he played one minute.

1011~~~
Yeah I understand this, I just find it amusing we sign a player with a name as big as Valdes and now this happened. In a few years we'll probably have forgotten we had a world cup winning, 3x champions league winning keeper play for us.


Edit: 


This is pretty much what I mean, except with a bigger name. I had forgotten Tony Coton played for us. Or that other Spanish keeper who made a really good save for us once in some dead rubber CL group game about a decade ago

1012~~~
Yet we will still make money out of this deal because he is leaving for sure this summer.

1013~~~
Brutal. Like his honesty though.

1014~~~
Oh yeah. From that perspective it is kind of mental. Victor Valdes ffs.

1015~~~
What an idiot. Even if he was only earning £20k a week he'd have had £500k off us for a few minutes against Arsenal and a dead rubber. We've spent a fortune this summer and De Gea is still likely to go, so he probably wasn't far from a shot at a first team place. IDIOT.

Anyway, Lindegaard isn't good. If he's our second choice I'm concerned, and if he's starting games our season is over before it's begun.

1016~~~
Did not see this coming.

1017~~~
Based on what can I ask? Lindegaard's last first team against Newcastle under Moyes he was solid enough and made some good saves.

1018~~~
This philosophy shit is so fecking tiresome.

1019~~~
Was not expecting this, brutally honest by LVG. Anyone any idea what reserve game is in question? I mean he played a few so it's a weird one for sure. 

Thought he might be staying with DDG uncertainty but if he's refused to play for the club at any level I'm glad Van Gaal is rightfully not happy.

1021~~~
I'm surprised other people are surprised.

It was obvious that something was going on after he was left out the tour squad. People scouring that picture looking for clues that he was too injured to travel were baffling the hell out of me when it was captioned by him saying that he had just finished a hard training session.

1022~~~
I'm with you.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1023~~~
Lindergaard is good enough as second choice.

1024~~~
feck off Valdes. Lost all my respect for the man.

1025~~~
Not good enough and with De Gea still hanging on a thread, we cannot give anyone else a decent chance to take the no.1 spot.. He'll do just fine in a UCL team somewhere else..

1026~~~
I've got a large 'V' tattoo on my stomach.

Guess I'll have to put 'Come and get it' above and pretend that's what I always meant.

1027~~~
To be honest I am slightly relieved - wasnt convinced that Valdes would be a good choice for #1 if/when De Gea left.

What we should do now is what we already should have been doing, and that is buying a promising young keeper like Cillesen who can potentially compete with De Gea and take over from him when he goes to Spain (assuming that he stays, which I realise isnt a safe assumption).

1028~~~
It's not really the philosophy, he wants players to regain form by playing football, and the u21 is the easiest way to do it, a player who refuses to follow the protocol can't stay in the team.

1029~~~
LvG <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

Probably even more ruthless than SAf

1030~~~
Completely agree with him, LVG brought him here because of their past relationship and Valdes pretty much used him.
I wouldn't want him part of my team either.

1031~~~
I was expect Valdes to be No1 next season.
But completely agree with LVG and his reasons for dumping him.

1032~~~

1033~~~
It's very unprofessional really and having worked with LvG before, Valdes must have known what was coming. 

Now the Cillisen/Romero links start to make sense, we are in the market for a 2nd choice GK. It would make some sense now to keep De Gea for this season, even if he goes for free next. Swapping both GKs is yet another risk

1034~~~
Actually i agree with both here. He is probably throwing him under the bus because he isn't good enough to be number 1 as per his estimation and wants to leave anyway than be number 2 even if De Gea leaves.

1035~~~

1036~~~
Shame it's ended for him like this, but no question I said from the start he could not replace DDG, and it's ended that way of what we have heard

1037~~~
What an ungrateful idiot Valdés.

1038~~~
Good riddance!! Brilliant from LVG, he is a nutter! Hope we get Oblak now

1039~~~
Just as well we weren't expecting to get much of a transfer fee for him.

1040~~~
The problem here is that Van gaal is creating a team, he can't afford to let a player act as if he was above the rules, even less when it's a veteran who is supposed to be an example.

1041~~~
He was on a free and probably low-ish wages. Not much lost.

1042~~~
Comparing Scholes to Valdes...

Valdes was never happy being the #2, illustrated by his refusal to give up his ego to play for our second team to keep and regain his fitness.

1043~~~
Difference here being that Ferguson wasn't dumb enough to remove scholes based on that altercation because it would hurt Manchester United in the long run. If it had been Gibson or somebody of the like he wouldn't hesitate. Valdes is not good enough to be Manchester United no 1 and is getting a decent wage aswell. Selling him does not hurt united at all.

1044~~~
Team creation and evolution is a continuous process. Not a one off thing.

My point is that he threw Valdes under the bus because he had less utility anyway. Won't possibly do the same with all other players.

I agree though we do however need a goalkeeper. I imagine the reason for Selling Valdes primarily would still be that he isn't seen as good enough to be number 1 and not happy being number 2 even if De Gea is sold. Rest all is slightly exaggerated grandstanding though might be a factor.

The whole thing could have been handled more tactfully and quietly.

1045~~~
Very weird situation.

He brought him on in the last game of the season to show what he could do and to help him find a new club. Then he goes about damaging his reputation by telling the journos he refused to play in the reserves.

So is he trying to help him move on or not?

1046~~~
"For example he refused last year to play in the second team, so. That's also one aspect of our philosophy, but there are a lot of other aspects in the philosophy; how you have to play like a goalkeeper in Manchester United. When you are not willing to follow that principles of the philosophy then there is only one way, and it is out."

Hmm, seems like he didn't want to adapt to English football here by the looks of it. "How you have to play like a goalkeeper in Manchester United."

1047~~~
He is creating a team, the core of this roster is new. He is establishing ground rules who are supposed to stick beyond him.

1048~~~
Don't see how a 3 time champions league winner, 6 time La liga champion, and 1 time World Cup winner should be penalised by being sold -for not playing with kids, but i don't run the club.

LVG probably felt some type of way about that.

1049~~~
Why on earth would you refuse to play for the reserves if it gives you a chance to get match practice and show the manager what you can do? It's one thing to not be massively enthusiastic about it, but to refuse is just stupid. Glad we're getting rid if that's the case.

1050~~~
He probably put him in the shop window and since then Valdes isnt playing ball with the teams looking to sign him (Valencia) like posting the picture yesterday suggesting he's staying. LVG is making it clear hes not wanted

1051~~~
This makes sense.

1052~~~
Because he is being paid to do a job regardless of what he has won in the past. United is bigger than victor fecking valdes.

1053~~~
He isn't paid to play with the reserves,no one is saying he is bigger than the club, let's not try and act like its a United thing - it's an LVG thing, and I have no problem with it.... (as long as his philosophy turns us into champions again) doesn't mean i won't comment on how weird it is.

1054~~~
shocking, but that's it

i'm afraid that's much more than that after we had regrouped in carrington.  maybe the valdes camp tried to exploit the opportunity from the ddg saga to ask for a big fat contract or threatening a move?

not a really too nice excuse by the moment indeed.  just make the door wide opened for ddg to a easy way out

1055~~~
Yeah good point

1056~~~
I refer you to my slightly better articulation a little later in the thread of what i meant

1057~~~
I don't think There is anything weird about it, you refuse to play then you have to go.
Having said that I don't think it is that straightforward and there is more to it. I trust in LVG.

1058~~~
So you're saying if Depay,Schweinsteiger or even Fellaini refuses to play for the reserves they would be sold?

1059~~~
Would have been a really good back up for our new keeper.

1060~~~
Now you're trying to say all footballers are treated equally which has never ever been the case.

1061~~~
I think we all know depay or bastian would not pull nonsense like that with LVG. If fellaini does it he should be sold as he isn't nearly as good as the other two.

1062~~~
No, I mentioned 3 different players who have 3 different roles in the team, with Bastian and Fellaini similar to Valdes in terms of being past their primes for the former and being second choice options and somewhat dispensable for the latter.

1063~~~
I know, Barca player acting like a princess... shocking.

1064~~~
So basically none of the three players would toe Van Gaal's party line but even though some are past their prime, they are still considered more important to the United squad than Valdes which is the key thing at the end of the day. Especially if he doesn't want to be number 2 - a role which requires a player to play in the reserves on occasion for fitness purposes.

1065~~~
Valdes was not simply sold because he didn't go to the U21's:

"That's also one aspect of our philosophy, but there are a lot of other aspects in the philosophy; how you have to play like a goalkeeper in Manchester United."

He didn't want to play like he had to, to be able to be the GK of Manchester United.

If Fellaini didn't want to adapt, he would be sold. Same with any player.

1066~~~
Never thought he was suited to the PL but surprised it went down this way and LvG hanging him out to dry.

1067~~~
On it.

1068~~~
Excellent.

1069~~~
Really don't give a feck about who comes in, who goes and who stays at the end of the day - as long as the philosophy makes us champions again.

Otherwise all these changes tailor made for LVG will look like a waste of time at the end of his tenure.

1070~~~
Bit harsh from Van Gaal to do so in a press conference like that but if Valdes acts like a nob then i can't say he doesn't deserve it. Odd that it's come to this though and Valdes has acted very ungratefully if this is true also.

1071~~~
Did LVG give Valdes his debut at Barcelona?

1072~~~
He did.

1073~~~
Valdes pissed on his own chips here. If its true he refused to do the same at Barca with him aswell he hasn't a leg to stand on. Too much player power nowadays and Im pleasantly surprised by LVGs stance. Valdes has had his arse handed to him

1074~~~
what needs to happen , is he is sold ASAP and a new keeper bought.
He will need time to settle in and get to know his new team mates.
Unless we keep DDG that is.

1075~~~
Valdes always came across as quite professional to me, in his time at Barca, I'm surprised LvG made this public more than anything, he could have made it clear his time at United was over behind closed doors, and still shipped him out, without stating the reasons to the public it's quite a damning statement on Valdes character.

1076~~~
after watching the video i'm convinced the valdes side pissed off the club more than lvg personally.

and the only reason i can think about is money.   not surprising if they pissed off woody directly at all, and just one word from our now being super star woody, lvg wouldn't hesitate to show him the door

1077~~~
I don't rate Valdes that highly and with close to zero games played for us I hardly see him as a United player, so in this case I don't care much.
But I am not sure on LvG's ruthlessness, there's a reason he hardly stays long at big clubs as he falls out with everyone. 
Ppl say Fergie was like this, but they forget that most players he fell out with was AFTER getting years of great performances and many titles out of them, and he was forgiving and diplomatic at the same time, otherwise he wouldn't have succesfully been able to lead the club for that long. Becks and Keane had a lot of leeway at times and got a lot of freedom and "forgiveness" for some of their actions because Fergie knew how important they were. 

The Valdes stuff, Di Maria handling, insisting everytime how everyone has to follow his philosophy, players who miss pens are put at the end of the queue, etc. This way many players will play like robots and fear that they could be called out next.

Will be interesting to see how long this works.

1078~~~
This is great news as long as we don't sign someone like Cillessen to replace De Gea.

1079~~~
Looks like Sergio Romero will be our #2 then? From a former barca keeper to the Argentina keeper. We are definitely looking to sign Messi in a couple of years

1080~~~
A bit worrying indeed but LVG isn't staying for more than 3-4 years anyway, he isn't a long term solution imo. I think he's going to be retired within 5 years regardless of how well he fares with us.

1081~~~
LvG expecting his players to play and behave in the way that is the best for the club is nothing bad. It's about having the most cohesive team and locker room.

1082~~~
he was asked the question and forced to elaborate

1083~~~
This is why finding a number 2 GK is trickier than some think.Patience sometimes is even more important than quality unless you want to find a new one every 2-3 seasons.That's why I always hope a homegrown GK whoever that is will be good enough (and must be good enough) to step up as they're generally more patient than imports.

Same with Falcao, Valdes shown in his U21s appearances that he's not good enough (anymore) to have a bigger role with the first team.Fitness might be an excuse but we shouldn't keep someone with that fitness level either.

1084~~~
You don't criticise a player in public. 

That's low from LvG in a presser. He could have just said he's left him behind for other reasons like personal training regime.

1085~~~
I didn't mean to criticize LVG, just the way fans keep repeating it as if it's very "cool" or that no player should mess with "LVG's philosophy". Sometimes the Caf feels like it's populated by teenagers only. Maybe it is.

1086~~~
It's the club's philosophy going forward, otherwise we would see the board and Ed Woodward clashing with LvG. LvG has also definitely adapted the philosophy to what's best for the club and it isn't anything cool. The philosophy is how you conduct yourself as a person and how you perform on the pitch, having a clear outline (or "philosophy") to follow will only help cohesiveness within the squad.

1087~~~
LvG could have said something more diplomatic, but then again, it is LvG.

1088~~~
Maybe LvG could have not elaborated so much and ended the topic diplomatically. Problem is, he is brutally honest and though he tries to try to side step some questions, he basically likes calling a spade a spade. Valdes must have pissed him off badly.

1089~~~
I can't think of a manager who hasn't criticised one of his players in public.

I personally like Van Gaal's honesty.

1090~~~
I like the honesty, but by the sounds of it he probably went too far. Valdes must have really annoyed him though.

1091~~~
There seem to be more people blaming LVG than Valdes in this thread. 

This reflects very poorly on Valdes. He basically used us as a glorified rehab clinic, while getting paid for sitting on the bench. No intention of fighting for his place in the side, which suggests to me he was never interested in staying with us anyway.

1092~~~
It would put us in a tight spot if DDG leaves as well. We'll probably have to pay a premium to get a top class keeper (depending on our relations with the selling club)

1093~~~
For once someone actually said what is going to happen. Do not know why so many people blame van Gaal? Seems to me that Valdes wanted something for given when he should have fought for a starting place. 

I have no issue with van Gaal being so blunt, especially to a player we helped recover from a serious injury. 

"He doesn't follow my philosophy. There is no place for someone like that," said Van Gaal of his January signing.

Last year, he refused to play in the second team and there are other aspects you need as a keeper at United. 

"It is a big disappointment. It is a pity because we have given him the opportunity to rehabilitate, gave him a contract and then he is fit to play."

"When you are not willing to follow those principles, there is only one way and that is out. 

"I played him at Hull because I wanted to help. I am always a very social human being."

He isn't just mindlessly and randomly disprespecting players. For De Gea who wants to leave he says : "I cannot say anything. <b>His attitude is fantastic. </b>It is stupid to ask."

1094~~~
This is why I love LVG, he doesn't feck around. Have to trust LVG that Valdes really pissed him off. 

Refusing to play in the 2nd team is kind of weird. You would think that Valdes knew what he was in for when he singed in January. Did he think that he would be playing ahead of De Gea. 

Regardless, from what we know of the situation, I think it's good that he's gone. Hopefully we get Romero in shortly to replace him.

1095~~~

1096~~~
Again, I'm not talking about the "philosophy" in itself so maybe you need to re-read my previous once more ?

1097~~~
I can see why some folks are saying he should van Gaal should have been more diplomatic or oblique...but to hell with him.  If you are too good for your role, get on.  Call a spade a spade.

1098~~~

You've outdone yourself, mate.

1099~~~
If DDG stays for one more season, and we still have Lindegaard, why would we need a third senior keeper?

1100~~~
He probably thought he could just waltz in to the first team after De Gea leaves. I'm glad he was wrong. Good riddance.

1101~~~
Exactly. I'm glad LvG has called him out in public. Major shithousery from Valdes who used us as a injury rehabilitation home and didn't bother to work hard and play in the reserves.

1102~~~
Amazing. Some people are so precious. Oh poor Valdes being humiliated in public.

If fergie had said this, nobody would have batted an eye lid.

Feck him the lazy freeloader

LVG is letting everyone know he's up for sale.

1103~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1104~~~
Poor from Valdes really.

LVG isn't fecking around. RVP and Valdes, two players he was apparently close to, both being sold.

1105~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow!

1106~~~
I was anyway shitting at the thought of Valdes being GK when considering his weakness at corners and crosses. Good riddance.

1107~~~
Both for different reasons though. RVP was deemed surplus to requirement while Valdes acted poorly. I think LVG wanted to keep Valdes around but his attitude put a lid on that.

1108~~~
Soppy sausage, the only thing I didn't like is VG giving him playing time while knowing he was to be sold

1109~~~
What's low is Valdes being an ungrateful prick despite LVG helping him recuperate from injury.

1110~~~
I was happy for him to be our number one this season if DDG left, shame he blew his chance.

1111~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1112~~~
We are patient enough as a club to ride through the tantrums because we believe that players come and go but the manager is above all!

Except next year we don't have control over De Gea.

1113~~~
Anyone reckon this is just a public PR (almost smear) campaign to justify it all?

Don't get me wrong, it looks like he's going but...

<ul>
<li>We've committed to De Gea staying which also defied all financial logic and probably reneged on any hopes of first team action to Valdes for 18 months if he were to stay.</li>
<li>He's fit again and is a senior goalkeeper in near-prime conditioning once more. While the philosophy here is for reserve action, the culture in Spain is to question decisions and when he's a player of that calibre (top 5 on form, previous top 3) it's entirely reasonable.</li>
</ul>Something suggests that our stance on DDG has impacted this significantly and he's not prepared to become the fall guy (naturally) and watch 18 months of his career disappear following an extensive period injured.

All fair enough really.

1114~~~
No where near enough games last season for Valdes to be sitting on his arse instead of playing reserve games. 

I'm fine with what he said. He didn't do what was asked, LvG didn't accept it and he's off, that's it.

1115~~~
No, it is not reasonable to join a club and then refuse to play whilst taking your pay packet and using their world class facilities to get yourself back to fitness.

1116~~~
Valdes is in the wrong and it's completely unacceptable to refuse to play for the reserves when fit because you deem yourself 'above' that level.  What kind of example does that set to the other players in the squad and the young players at the club?

I have no issue with LVG not keeping it behind closed doors.  If he had done that and then sold Valdes this summer with a De Gea departure also looking quite possible... how many fans would have questioned his decision to sell Valdes?  Now we all know the reasons why he'll be leaving the club, it's quite understandable.

1117~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant comments by van Gaal. I guess Romero rumours have some substance then, he'd be a good back up, van Gaal knows him very well from his time at AZ and would probably even be capable of replacing De Gea in the short term.

1118~~~
whilst i think LVG was harsh to tell all in public i do have to wonder about Valdes' attitude.
maybe he thinks he's too good to play reserve football but every man and his dog knew that there'd be a very good chance that DDG would leave this summer and had he just gritted his teeth for 6 months he could well have been starting keeper next season at a new and improving united. instead he'll find himself at a middling club all because he wants to play it the big un. i'm not that bothered myself as i've never rated him that highly but he's messed up a great opportunity imo

1119~~~
Why not though?

Why should any player be allowed to behave in an unprofessional manner and not be called onfitnwss

LVG gave Valdes access to the best medical facilities time to regain his fitness and reprove himself. And then he refuses to play in a reserve game and expects to be shielded from the consequences.

1120~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1121~~~

1122~~~
Wow his tweet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1123~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1124~~~
The reason managers don't criticise a player in public is because it can damage their relationship with them, making it harder for them to do their job and get good performances out of the player.

That does not apply here as Van Gaal, rightly, wants Valdes gone.

1125~~~
interesting...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1126~~~
I think it is brilliant leadership from LvG.  We have been complaining for years about the squad littered with players who are not willing to fight for a place, play in the reserves and happy to take a fat pay packet for doing nothing.  These comments only highlight how well LvG is gripping this within the club and letting players know that it will be hard work at United.  
His ruthlessness in management when dealing with players is exactly what the club needs during this transition period.
For me, he has got rid of the right players, I've been delighted with the players he's bought in and cannot wait for the season to get underway.  The clubs handling on the DDG situation seems to be spot on so far and whether he stays another season and goes on a free, or we get a huge fee for him, I don't think we can say the club didn't do enough.

1127~~~
As someone who doesn't rate Valdes and dreaded the thought of him replacing DDG, happy to see the back of him.

LVG could have contained this in-house though, without stating why in public. And the shiteous "oh he's just sooo brutally honest" thing is a wash. I'm sure SAF was brutally honest too, but sometimes he knew when to "lie" to the press and keep them out, and if he could do it, then LVG sure as feck can too. And this isn't out of sympathy for Valdes, as I said above, I couldn't care less for him.

1128~~~
3 games in 6 months.

1129~~~
Big difference, Scholes was an established member of our team by then. Schmeichel also had bust up with SAF before, would he been as forgiving had either been new players that just joined us? I doubt so. LVG may have worked with Valdes before, but he himself was only here barely half a year earlier. He can't afford to let the other players see him go soft on a new signing challenging him.

1130~~~
Wouldn't be surprised it that was half of the U21 games since he signed going by how shoddy the system is.

1131~~~
Unlike most, I actually think they can work this one out.

1132~~~
^ He is an idiot for comparing the Scholes situation. In any case, if there was an issue with Valdes, we should just sold him without a full public disclosure. The player hasn't said anything. So there was no need for us to either. Could have simply said, he is being moved on.
Although tbf, we expected LVG to being completely frank.

1133~~~
Oh dear <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Sounds like Valdes didn't really know there was a problem, especially considering his tweet from 2 days ago...

1134~~~
Yeah real lack of class from lvg. This sort of thing makes the whole club a bit more like Chelsea. What a crap way of going about stuff by lvg. And Valdes. Everyone comes off looking like a prat.

1135~~~
Anderson and the cake! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1136~~~
Or maybe he was just trying to dress it up nicely. Oh look, I'm working real hard...

1137~~~
That killed me too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1138~~~
People might find the honesty refreshing and what not, but I'd say LVG went too far here. Yeah, he's probably pissed off that a player he's helped regain full fitness hasn't done what was expected of him, but even still... it didn't really need a public airing at all. Valdes could have been moved on in a much more amicable fashion.

1139~~~
Unless Valdes wasnt being reasonable when clubs tried to talk to him and was going to sit on his contract, refusing to play for the reserves

1140~~~
Nothing refreshing about this. Let's be honest, you don't sign Victor Valdes and expect him to be happy in the reserves, and it's not like he never played for them.

At a time when your main goalkeeper has his agent manufacturing a move to Real Madrid, I'd have thought Valdes would get chances. 

I get the feeling the underlying issue is LVG doesn't rate Valdes and wants to ship him out on that basis and has found some sort of excuse, but ultimately just looks like a bit of a dick.

1141~~~
I do think LVG was extra disappointed in Valdes because he knew him before so Valdes should know better. Falcao wasn't keen on the under 21's either but it's a two way thing. Victor could have done with the games and the kids would have loved to play against and face him in all the under 21 games. Valdes might have got more games that way. It's disappointing as Valdes is an intelligent guy. I do think LVG has taken it personally.

The guy missed a fair bit of football. You need games to get back to fitness, regardless of the level.

1142~~~
So if he didnt say it we all would wonder why he's off? 
Now he has said it its wrong cause he went to far. 
I still understand why he went too far or sthing, he didnt say anything special. Would if it be so much different if he had just said he didnt stick to training regime?

1143~~~
No, but given our financial strength we'll consider it a win to keep him for another season even if that means losing him for nothing next summer.

On top of that, as I said, we'll know that there's any number of ways in which the situation at Madrid might have changed by next summer. They might have a new manager who doesn't want De Gea, or the political situation might mean there's a different player who they have to try and get to appease the fans, or they might have bought some other Spanish keeper (like Casilla) who will have won over the fans.

1144~~~
It was never going to take a long time for LVG, was it? We all know his so-called methods by now. He crosses the lines sometime or a lot of times. There was no need for this open slugfest. When he's not your player anymore, no need to even comment about him.

1145~~~
There is a chance DDG will renew. 

I mean I probably would in his position if I couldn't get the Real move this summer. It doesn't really stop him moving clubs and gives him more money until he does.

1146~~~
as poor as it is from Valdes to refuse to play for U21s, it is worse from the manager to not have some sense of self-control.

he set himself up for a response from Valdes which will show him in a poor light which was unnecessary

1147~~~
Nobody is asking Valdes to be happy playing for the reserves. But if you're asked to play, you play. If you dont do what the manager wants you to do, you're obviously gone. There is clearly a reason why LVG spoke about this in public, when hes kept all of the goings on with other players (ddg, van persie, etc) private. Most likely its that the player you've told to find a new club is posting pictures suggesting he's staying and isnt taking offers that are too good for him from the likes of Valencia.

1148~~~
Indeed, but players are also human beings, and mostly spoilt ones, they make mistakes. Sure if someone goes too far then there's no way back usually and as I said I don't care much here (though he could have dealt differently with it publicly). 

But SAF didn't release Scholes when he refused to play. He also had a lot of patience at times when Rooney (when he was young and a great player) was off partying and / or off form and instead we heard by SAF how he had a virus or was injured. There are lots of other examples, too with players. It will be seen if LvG has done that with Valdes because he is not that important and will deal differently if a more important player behaves like that or does something stupid. 

Obviously LvG has to deal with stuff like that, but do it internally and only in public if he wants to acchieve something specific by it. You just can't in every case call out for a player in public and leave yourself and the player no way back if a mistake by the player is made, that will be very costly for the club if a more important player is involved and let go as a result.

1149~~~
I agree with this. If he's gone, he's gone, no need to make things so public.

1150~~~
Sends out a message to everyone. Refusing to play for the reserves, feck him.

1151~~~
Incredible.

1152~~~
He was asked a question, he answered it. Obviously he could've fudged it, but it would come out either way that Valdes had some sort of attitude problem being #2. In the end, this is about sub-keeper leaving and will be forgotten very quickly.

1153~~~
Valdes may be acting difficult about moving on which is why Van Gaal has no problem speaking out like that to the press. He could have called him out last season but instead he even gave him a chance to showcase his ability when De Gea got injured

1154~~~
I don't think in this life or the next there will be a manger that would refuse De Gea given the choice. THe fans want De Gea now and we will milk Perez dry for him or not sell him altogether. They're in a really bad position with Iker going and they have no choice but to pay up.

I hope we don't sell to them and they buy someone like Leno because that will be the end of the De Gea saga.

1155~~~
Some people need to actually watch the press conference and not just read the headlines. Nothing he said was ruthless. LvG clearly considers Valdes gone, and so he doesn't have to protect him.

1156~~~
Shots fired, top bantz etc..

1157~~~
I get the feeling that van Gaal only made this public so that he could send a message to his players that he cannot be toyed with. He wants and expects the full effort and dedication from his players on his approach and expectations, and if a player doesn't work hard enough, van Gaal will get him out.

The fact that van Gaal talked about Valdes not suiting his philosophy as a whole means that him skipping U-21 matches isn't the only reason for van Gaal looking to offload Valdes. Something else may have happened behind the scenes that van Gaal may not have liked, but he only brought up the U-21 reason just to not bring up the other issues.

1158~~~
14 games from the Liverpool game to the end of the season. He played in 3, all at home, all against big sides.

1160~~~
Yup, he mentioned a training regime too.

1161~~~
Well he performed poorly, theres that major factor

1162~~~

1163~~~
He didnt make his dealings and reasons with RVP public, he kept them private. Similar with Hernandez, he was asked about both

There's clearly a very good reason why he wasn't private about whats going on with Valdes

1164~~~
I'm too lazy/brain-dead to do it but has anyone else thought back to the U-21 games last season and come up with specific games that Valdes could/should have played but didn't? They played few enough games and he did feature in some of them.

1165~~~
Yup, his U-21 performances were quite inconsistent, and even though he had a blinder against Hull, he was still quite weak in the air and couldn't handle the physicality of the Premier League.

1166~~~
Although I get what Luckhurst mean why couldnt he have wrote a normal tweet. Instead he wrote one which sounds like bantu english.

1167~~~
Yeah and I think your theory above is a good one. Perhaps we want Valdes out and he's dicking us about in the search for a new club?

1168~~~
Right. In the presser he mentioned that he was disappointed in him especially as they've worked together before, and that Valdes should know his philosophy/standards.

1169~~~
There is none.

1170~~~
I think Van Gaal is right....We have a massive squad and he's going to have a lot of established stars that he is going to have to ask to play for the U21's to keep them fit such as Fellaini, Jones, Shaw, Hernandez etc ...He's laying down the law

1171~~~
Wasn't there a report that Valdes didn't want to leave. He might have presumed he was going to replace DDG and LvG has different ideas. If there has been attitude problems then we might be doing this as a last resort to force him out.

1172~~~
It kind of strengthens our hand with the De Gea thing as well. Madrid will have to give us a massive incentive to part with him now as we have no back up in place.

1173~~~
Because there wasn't any issue with rvp beyond him not being a major part of the plan. I don't think there are issues between rvp and Lvg. As for Chicharito he said he will come back to us meaning I reckon he is in Lvg s plans for this season

1174~~~
What does this actually mean? Why has he put the score in just one?

1175~~~
Scores don't mean anything. It is just there for one match because maybe it was there at source from where Valdes got those images. He basically wants to say that he played u21 and with the 4th pic he wants to show he was happy doing it.

1176~~~
Oh cheers. I thought the 2-1 had some significance. To be fair he played with Anderson in the same team. That is a very big sacrifice

1177~~~
At least when Valdes goes people can stop spelling his name VALDEZ, Been my pet hate on here for months. Not sure how and why you would put Z on the end rather than S.

1178~~~
Fixed.

1179~~~
Anderson <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1180~~~
I very rarely post, but I have to say that is bloody brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1181~~~
Thank god he's going I still maintain he's a bang average keeper. Laughable people actually wanted him as number 1 if de gea left. Good riddance.

1182~~~
Now this is getting ugly. Embarrassing for the club that it's happening in public.

1183~~~
I wonder whether part of this is us clearing the way for a top class keeper to come in without weakening our hand in the De Gea negotiations. The last thing we want to do is bring one in after De Gea is sold. We'd struggle to get Shay Given for less than £30m in that scenario.

1184~~~
If his saying he played in the U21's then maybe he was expecting De Gea to leave and be 1st choice BUT Dave is now staying and Victor doesn't want to be 2nd fiddle...


I'm just dreaming here lads!

1185~~~
when you found no lead, or multiple leads headed to different outcomes, just follow the money

1186~~~
Who would you like to come in then, who is attainable? There aren't many great keepers out there at the moment.

1187~~~
Lindegaard says hi.

1188~~~
Our rivals seem to have quality back ups

Chelsea - Begovic
Madrid - Casilla
Bayern - Ulreich
Arsenal - Ospina,Szczez what's his face
Barca - Bravo

Heck even Spurs have Vorm... I hope we have a solid replacement for Valdes, we are in danger of signing a 2nd string GK to replace our World Class GK and signing a 3rd string GK to replace our 2nd string GK.

1189~~~
Except Ospina and Bravo maybe, I will take Lindegaard over others. So, yeah, we do have a backup and a solid one.

1190~~~
Unless we get the targets we want, as he said about the "process". We get who we want, we will let him go as LVG didnt fancy him

The point is LVG didnt bring Valdes' situation into the public for no reason. He did it because unlike RVP, Hernandez and whoever else, Valdes is causing a problem and needs a shove out the door

1191~~~
We had 7 U21 games after Valdes' last appearance for the U21s and he didn't play in any of them.

I have no problem with what Van Gaal said. After watching the press conference it wasn't that ruthless just very honest. He clearly mentioned that he feels disappointed in Valdes and it's understandable. 
Valdes had been out for a long time with that knee injury and Van Gaal gave him a chance to train at United and later offered him a new contract. He obviously understood that he was backup to De Gea and for a keeper that had been out that long it would make sense for him to get game time for the U21s.

1192~~~
And that's in your opinion right?

1193~~~
The publicity (word?) of the situation does slightly concern me. I will trust that LVG knows what he is doing in that regard - but Valdes tweeted about a lack of respect shown by LVG and to be honest, I am inclined to agree.

1194~~~
My post will of course be in my opinion unless I am quoting someone else, right?

1195~~~
What about the lack of respect in not playing for the U21s by a manager who helped rehabilitate him from injury?

1196~~~
But are we really convinced that is the case? Valdes struck me as a professional and whatever his dealings with LVG were, they were behind closed doors. Hanging out dirty laundry in public is rarely a good move.

1197~~~
Your post suggested it was common knowledge, but never mind never mind just checking.

1198~~~
How did Valdes fair in the reserve games? And did LVG also make Butt play for the reserves at Bayern Munich?

1199~~~
He's played for the u21s last season so he's clearly not trying to act like some big shot who thinks he's above the team.

1200~~~
I said, "I will take Linndegaard over others.." <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1201~~~
Valdes didn't say "I never refused to play in the U21 games", he only stated that he played in three of them.  That's a lot of games to potentially have refused to play in.  I'm inclined to take LVG for his word, he has no reason to do this if it's a lie.

1202~~~
Before later refusing to play for them. If he doesnt do ask the manager asks of him he thinks hes above the club

1203~~~
It is defiantly more of a relief for me, the idea of him replacing DDG would have been a huge disaster. Do not know who I would be scared more of, Fergie in his prime? or LVG?

1204~~~
Tell him to stop sending me bloody messages, if he wants to stalk someone make it Van Gaal.

1205~~~
I can't see the tweets at work. What has actually happened?

1206~~~
He posted a pic showing 3 reserve games he played in with 'respect?' as the caption? 

His picture proves nothing. Van Gaal said he refused to play for the U21s and Valdes posting this picture doesn't mean he didn't refuse it just shows he played in three of them. 1 in January, 1 in February and 1 in March. 

We had 7 U21s game after that and he didn't play in any of them so I assume it was during that period that he refused. And for a goalkeeper that had been rehabilitated and hadn't played football for a long time the logical thing would be to play for the reserves.

1207~~~
The presser made me laugh, but it's true that LVG should have kept that one in house, he put Valdes in an awkward situation.

1208~~~
Leaving Valdes hanging out to dry is stupid. Also potentially puts off other clubs. If he did refuse to play then there's no place for that here but deal with it in private.

1209~~~
What are you talking about? He still has a contract with United.

My only worry is this will become an open slugfest and that will never look good. Hope this gets sorted quickly and Valdes can move on to another club.

1210~~~
Imagine this being a normal job and your current manager has basically broadcasted that you are a lazy fecker. Never a good idea.

1211~~~
Looking at it that way makes it even worse.

1212~~~
If it was a normal job he'd have been fired for refusing to do what his manager asked him to do

1213~~~
I'm surprised some are even defending him. Valdes, injured for over a year, helped him rehabilitate and given a contract then refusing to play practice games.

Nothing wrong with LVG telling the truth.

1214~~~
Eh? No. There would have been a disciplinary hearing in which both sides would have been given the chance to put forth their side of the story. You don't get the pink slip because your manager does not fancy you.

Point is, I am all for kicking Valdes out of the club if he actually is not listening to the manager but to put this in front of the media is not the right way to go about it. This also reduces our ability to negotiate a good fees.

1215~~~
If Tevez managed to get a new club after City I guess poor old Valdes will manage to despite LVG 'slagging' the poor fellow.

1216~~~
I'm not defending such actions (if they're true) but there's clearly something more going on. LvG's arguments doesn't make sense. 

LvG mentioned something about VV not following his philosophy and something about not following what he wants from a keeper training- and style-wise, yet he has extensive knowledge about the keeper from their time in Barcelona together. So, why give him a chance to rehabilitate and then go on and sign him? Valdes apparently refused to play an U-21 match yet he was selected for the first team squad for the second half of the campaign. He then decided to start him against Hull as a nice gesture so he could prove his worth with other potential suitors watching, yet decided to hang him out to dry as an unprofessional before he has left the club. I bit Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from LvG here.

1217~~~
I am not even saying anything to the contrary. I am pointing out that it is insulting a man in front of the media. A footballer like Valdes won't have to worry about a job.

1218~~~
He didnt insult him, he said he didnt do as told, didnt stick with training regime and refused to play in U21 game. How is that insulting?

1219~~~
Ok. Insult was perhaps too strong a word. But he did hang him out to dry and not in a personal meeting but openly in the presser. Valdes is in the wrong if what LVG says is true but there are always two sides to a story and no one is infallible. If Valdes did make a mistake, kick him out of the club but it's better to keep matters in-house.

1220~~~
How is that not insulting?

1221~~~
Hopefully our next backup goalkeepers will have easier names, as apparently it is impossible to spell Lindegaard and Valdes right.

1222~~~
How is it insulting?

1223~~~
We were due for something like. Van Gaal has been known for having public fall outs with players. Luckily is was with a player that was inessential.

1224~~~
Regardless of whether it was true or not, would you not be insulted if your boss did a Facebook/Linkedin/whatever post basically stating how you weren't a hard worker and didn't follow his instructions. thus you were going to be let go?

1225~~~
With his statements he basically questioned his professionalism all out in public

1226~~~
Saying that what LvG did was not correct doesn't mean supporting Valdes. Valdes maybe wrong, but it could have been a private conversation with him and asking him to find a new club rather than telling the press he sucks.

1227~~~
I wouldnt have liked it to say the least but maybe the boss would do it if I really stepped over the line big time.

Anyway some of you are making too much of a big deal of this whole story. Cant wait for it to die down.

1228~~~
I'd much prefer this kind of shit was dealt with behind closed doors. 

Public handbag throwing doesn't reflect well on anybody.

1229~~~
Get ready for another LVG presser in which he brings print outs which has list of all dates a reserve match was played and the time of the day when he asked Valdes to play in it and he refused. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1230~~~
Dont think that will happen.

1231~~~
We have already had a first not-so-subtle jab from Valdes' camp on twitter. This can get ugly pretty quickly if we don't do something to curb it.

1232~~~
at least we know why he spent so much of the hull match flapping at crosses, he was actually waving goodbye
bless him

1233~~~
Exactly, just looks bad. 

I bet you laughed your arse off when Benitez had his little 'facts' rant, but you'd think it was great if LVG did this.

1234~~~
He's the manager of the club, he'd have all authority to fire someone on the spot. Valdes is lucky

1235~~~
I was talking about a normal job and so were you when you quoted my post. As I said, LVG has every right to want rid of him if he does not want him at the club but the way to handle that should have been better.

1236~~~
LVG would have already made up his mind that Valdes is not needed before the presser. He might have a contract, but he was as good as gone by then. He could have easily said something like Valdes looking for a new club to play regular football or something else on similar lines. No controvery, no slugfest.

1237~~~
The Rejection of Philosophy dossier. Can't wait to see a copy of that.

1238~~~
I concur that we should have handled it in a better way than to openly throw fists at each other. Just wanted to point out that your quote was incorrect and he is <i>still </i>our player,

1239~~~
Or the manager would be sued for unfair treatment and harassment.

1240~~~
Without reading this thread back too far is the theory that he will be offered to Valencia as part of the Otamendi deal? £3-£4 million off his fee maybe.

If what LVG said is true then it's hard to blame him for calling him out in the presser, we took a chance on him, no doubt put a lot of time into getting him fit again, and paid him handsomely, he should have unquestionably  done everything that was asked him thereafter.

1241~~~
Have to hope now that Valdes quickly finds a new club and is moved on.

Whilst LvG has every right to want rid of him, whatever the circumstances, having your boss slag you off at a press conference when you've no right of reply is just plain wrong. This should have been dealt with between the player and LvG. In private.

1242~~~
Valdes was injured in March 2014, and we only officially signed him in January, so he had not been playing any games for about 9 months. We have also signed him to a 18-month contract, which I imagine would be quite a sum due to his reputation. In 6 months, he played 3 U-21 games, and all against big sides. That is nowhere near enough game time for Valdes to be match fit, and if you're paid that much yet you refuse to listen to what your manager tells you to do, that is being unprofessional, no matter how you spin it.

Yes, LVG might not need to tell the media everything about Valdes, but this is something expected because this is LVG we are talking about. He will either be 100% honest about it or not talk about it at all.

1243~~~
This is what I feel too. If what he says about Valdes is true, then no sympathy for the player, but it makes no sense that he would have wanted to help him by starting him against Hull. I love LVG, and I wish Moyes had been a bit more ruthless with the likes of Rio, but there is the fear of the inevitable LVG-team falling out raising its ugly head here. I can't imagine this sort of thing will help us win the heart of the DDG (perhaps that ship has sailed anyway,) nor strengthen our hand in recruiting new players (although I guess money is the ultimate motivator in that respect.)

All in all, I'll trust LVG on this, despite the lingering sense of unease.

1244~~~
That is not true at all. He certainly knows when to be discreet. He didn't say much about what he discussed with RvP and is certainly not telling anything about what discussions are going on with Di Maria.

1245~~~
when explaining the reason of why:

. lvg deliberately corrected from "my" to "our" philosophy
. and after giving all those footballing reasons he further elaborated "That is one aspect of our philosophy but there are a <b>lot of others</b> for how you play like a goalkeeper for Manchester United"

i'm convinced those "lot of others" are the key things of the valdes drop out

1246~~~
You're a professional football player an average around 15 years, it flies by. If you don't give 100% in that time then goodbye. LvG is in his own right to do what he did, Valdes is 33 and an experienced international footballer, he knows the score, there's no excuses

1247~~~
Well there you go. That really is taking the piss. If he had a bit more match practice he might kept out the Arsenal equaliser.

1248~~~
He has pretty much pissed away a starting spot which is a massive shame.

1249~~~
some cafers brought out a very good point, lvg only brought out the valdes case but others into the public.

my verdict is, lvg spoke it out for somebody he's answering to

1250~~~
This has became a joke now. I hope Valdes just call it a day and move on.
When was the last time our manager and player use social network & media to criticize each other ? Bloody hell.

1251~~~
Why?

I like Van Gaal's honesty. And Valdes has plenty of time to explain his side. The club let Valdes recover from a bad injury, and then offered him a contract. It's obvious that players need to maintain their match fitness and sharpness, but Valdes wasn't humble enough play in the reserves while waiting for his opportunity. We can't have players like that in the team, as Van Gall explained.
Thought it was also a nice touch what he said about chicharito.

1252~~~
Because he don't want to talk about them, so he did not talk about them...

1253~~~
People questioning Lvg s professionalism, should also question valdes' . He posts a picture on Twitter Instagram and Facebook. The real professional way to reply is to respond like gundogan in a letter/statement or give an interview utmost. Not by posting pictures as if he is the admin of troll football

1254~~~
I think that LVG is passing a message here ie there is no us (LVG signings) and them (SAF-Moyes signings). He's been ruthless with SAF's men and now he's showing that he can be ruthless even with the people he brought in. Also kindly note that while rare, SAF did washed his dirty linen in the public. Case in point was Wayne Rooney

1255~~~
What is Valdes game? What does he hope to achieve? fecking ingrate!

1256~~~
LvG got pissed off with his refusal to follow orders and wants him gone. Not an issue for me. Do what the boss says or go. Unless the boss is wrong and the player in question is class, then we can cry.

1257~~~
Erm.... That is what discreet means.

1258~~~
Yeah, there's a difference between a player simply not being good enough, and someone being defiant.
It would be wrong for Van Gaal to publicly malign a player because they've lost form, or are not able to keep up with the standard, but when a player is openly defiant to what the manager requires, that deserves the kind of slap we saw last night.

1259~~~
As I said, van Gaal is perfectly entitled to want rid of Valdes for whatever reason. He's the manager. End of story. 

Valdes, however, is still an employee of Manchester United. Like the employee of any organisation he is entitled to the courtesy of his manager dealing with matters affecting his current and future employment with the organisation in confidence. He's also a human being. Is it right that anyone's boss uses the media to criticise their manner, attitude and application when they are not there to counter with their version of the story? 

Valdes may indeed have time to explain his side, however, this will likely play out as an unedifying series of accusations and counter accusations in the press or on Social Media. To me, that doesn't reflect well on Manchester United, it could have been avoided and, pragmatically, if De Gea does go to Madrid, clubs we may be negotiating with for his replacement will know our situation is urgent.

I'm all for honesty, frankness and less anodyne interviews with footballers and managers but in this instance, I believe van Gaal got it wrong.

1260~~~
Yes, that benefited the club as it put us on the front foot tackling the Rooney problem. How does this benefit the club in anyway? Valdes is not even remotely as important as Rooney was, nor are we trying to keep him. LVG basically called him out to be an undisciplined/unprofessional player.

1261~~~
I don't see why Van Gaal should have to lie to the national press to protect a player who has behaved so poorly that we are getting rid of him.

1262~~~
In Rooney's case it didn't benefited the club in this case I think it will

1263~~~
I understand what you're saying, but in this specific case, it is Van Gaal's judgment that is being questioned. Why in the world would he leave his number 2 keeper at home?
No one could understand it. May as well just be honest about it I reckon. When players are frustrated with their club, they ask for a transfer. When clubs are frustrated, they put players on the transfer list. It would be difficult for Van Gaal to try and explain why Valdes had been transfer listed, especially when the number 1 goalkeeper's future is vague.

1264~~~
It's a statement of intent from van Gaal, basically letting it be known that he will take no shit from anybody. Have no sympathy for Valdes at all, better players than him have played for our Reserves and handled it like a professional should

1265~~~
How did it not benefit the club? The fans got to know that the club is trying all it can to get him to sign. We put him on the back foot and although we did sign him on high wages, it was still a win than it would have been if we would have had to sell him to City or had he walked on a free next season.

1266~~~
Agreed! To be honest, I found LvG quite unprofessional publicly condemning Valdes. He still wants to play at high level football and to be publicly slagged off by your manager like that would certainly ruin his reputation and future. There is absolutely no reasons throwing him under the bus. 

Fining him there and then should having been a better option. What happened in the dressing room stays in the dressing room. The iron turnip is brutal.

1267~~~
As said I think that LVG is sending a message ie he is ruthless not only towards players who weren't brought by him but also with others. Sometimes managers do love to spill the beans especially to justify controversial decisions with players who refuse to stay inside the ranks. SAF did that when he was thinking of getting rid of Rooney. Now LVG is doing the same with Valdes

1268~~~
but he is not doing it very well.

Fergie did the same to an extent, but he just questioned Rooney's desire to continue playing for the club while Van Gaal's statement seems to question Valdes' professionalism, there is a subtle difference which adds up to much more unfortunately and could have been avoided

1269~~~
What's Valdes ever done for us?

1270~~~
Are you sure about that?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hb8ivhh5G9E?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

According to SAF, Wayne Rooney was fickle (he first said that he wanted to stay for life and than he changed his opinion) and lied about his injury. We're talking here of a world class forward who won us many honours not some wreck which we resurrected his career

1271~~~
Valdes deserves everything he got last night.

You can tell that LVG is personally hurt by Valdes' actions, considering what he's done for him and their past relationship.

Some people just can't wait to jump on LVG's back.

1272~~~
Oh I just love revisionism. Thanks devilish for that link.

1273~~~
I hope no one blames me of criticising SAF now. I always agreed with his idea of keeping things under wraps. However there come a time when you simply cant do it anymore. For example imagine the scene if United allowed Rooney to go without saying nothing. The fans would have gone into meltdown as accusations towards the club would have reached ridiculous heights.

 Valdes is not as important as Rooney is however with DDG leaving his actions does put us into a bad situation. He stipped us from the only advantage we had, ie trying to sign a new keeper without looking desperate for one. No wonder why LVG is pissed off. You dont treat someone who saved your career like that

1274~~~
Exactly, I'm baffled reading this thread. Guy who we've helped recovering, his old manager brought him in, gave him money, chance to train, then signed a fecking contract with him, tells LVG to feck off when he asks him to play in reserves in order to regain his form. Not only is he a knob but as well an idiot, he's had a chance of becoming an integral part of our squad, maybe even as a #1 goalkeeper as DDG will be a goner next year and he blew it.

He's played two fecking matches for us. Two. Absolutely no reason for any sentiments. He's done more harm than good.

1275~~~
Its not a criticism of Fergie. Its just pointing out that he's done similar things to people who claim that he would never done such a thing.

1276~~~
Because Valdez is a perfectly common name in many Spanish (and Portuguese) speaking countries.

1277~~~
3 games in 6 months

1278~~~
LVGs reputation is well known as is Valdes'. Much ado about nada

1279~~~
Well, we're definitely in the market for a new goalkeeper now! Valdes should be gone before they even return from the tour with a bit of luck.

1280~~~
In most likelihood both are partly at fault, but one is the boss. I don't know why so many ventilate strong opinions as if they had all the facts though.

1281~~~

1282~~~
I am aware of that, But Victor's surname isn't spelt with a Z yet people still can't seem to grasp it.

1283~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

LvG wasn't the first to do it. Its happened in the NFL as well....

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Singletary-dropped-pants-at-halftime-3187610.php" target="_blank">http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Singletary-dropped-pants-at-halftime-3187610.php</a>

1284~~~
I would say he has no reason to do this (make it public) regardless.

The only thing I can maybe see it as is a bit of posturing from the club about the De Gea situation - as in "we are so confident he is now going to stay, that we are selling Valdes anyway" - but that would be achieved without the situation going public.

1285~~~
I genuinely believe LvG wanted to set an example publicly that he is in charge and anyone even remotely questioning his methods (Philosophy) will be quickly ushered out. Surely, no player will refuse anything in training or during matches after this.

1286~~~
This wasn't just about missing the U21's, he refused to adapt himself as a goalkeeper to Manchester United. LvG also holds fitness very high in his decision to field players, if you're not fit you don't play. That's a simple outline that he holds all his players too and ensures his players stay on top of their fitness. When players have an ego or don't hold themselves to the highest standards and expect their talent to carry them, they don't have an attitude that would contribute to a dressing room that encourages cohesiveness. LvG follows the total human principle, so of course he is very empathetic but if you don't want to adapt yourself to the league/Manchester United, and then don't want to keep yourself fit... you don't belong. Falcao was given many chances last year, same with RvP despite their poor performances... they worked hard to get fit and to adapt their qualities to the system.

Edit: Those who don't follow the club's outline/philosophy of how to act and play wouldn't be involved anyway. This wasn't just missing a game, or getting drunk or whatever, this was refusing to keep himself fit (a huge principle of LvG) and refusing to adapt himself to the league/Manchester United.

1287~~~
Lots of people trying to make a fuss over nothing here. Managers speak out about players quite a lot sometimes it needs to be done. On top of this is were we to sell Valdes with De Gea possibly on the verge of leaving without this explanation everybody would be questioning him as well so he can't really win.

1288~~~
Very strange. Valdes must have known De Gea was on the way out, why wouldn't he stick out a few reserve games and pick up the number one spot once he's gone? Unless he's heard otherwise. i.e we're not letting De Gea go, or we're signing a replacement. 

Think LvG is just making an example of him. He's a big name, yet still fairly disposable. The perfect sacrifice to serve as demonstration to the rest of the team: You do what i say or you're out.

1289~~~
It is almost like he posted this to prove his point, but has actually proved LvG's point instead.

1290~~~
I wonder who was in the front row?<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1291~~~
Yep, Van Gaal could have been more discrete. On the other side, this entire mess wouldn't have existed if Valdez would have been professional. And he definitely wasn't by refusing to play in reserve matches.

Valdez was a player who hadn't played football for almost a year and no club was prepared to give him a contract (at least not a top club who can pay top wages). Van Gaal offered him so based on their previous relationship, and it is pretty much guaranteed that Valdez knows what he was getting (i.e that De Gea is No.1). Van Gaal doesn't give a shit for big names, he send a 250k/week striker playing there, he sends every player play there. Valdez hadn't played for a year and there was no chance that he was going to play for the first team a long as De Gea was fit. But if De Gea would have got injured then we would have been in deep shit because the second keeper isn't match fit cause he didn't fancy playing for the reserves.

Whatever Van Gaal did, he is on the right here. Even if the club has fined Valdez wages (and I hope this has happened) it would have been totally wait. When you get 5 millions or so in year, you don't refuse to play.

1292~~~
I'm tired of hearing the word "philosophy" used as a lame justification for cnuty behavior on LVG's part. At the very least just release Valdes and let him find another club. No need to poison the well in the process.

1293~~~
If what LvG said was true about Valdes refusing to play in the reserve, then the decision to ship him out is the wise one (but admittedly, this could have been done in a more subtle fashion)

Valdes had been out of first team football for over a year and with his injury record, not many big clubs were willing to gamble to take him in and use him as a first choice GK. Man Utd has been quite generous for offering him a contract. He was asked to play in the reserve team simply because the manager wanted to maintain his fitness level and wanted to assess if he's ready to take the challenge. Both Fletcher, RvP and Falcao have been in this situation before. A lot of other players from other clubs who just returned from injury would have been asked to play in the reserve team as well. It is not as if Valdes was forced to play in all of the reserve games. Otherwise Valdes has all the rights to turn down LvG's requests.

It is also not surprising to see Valdes being used as a backup GK in the senior team. With DDG's quality and consistency, it was certainly out of the question to bench him and use Valdes instead especially when the team was fighting for the top 3. Cech's situation at Chelsea was even worse in my opinion. And at the moment, I think Liverpool is the only team in the top 6 that would use him as a first choice GK.

1294~~~
I can understand setting an example, I just cant understand the need for publicity. If LVG really feels the need to set a <i>public</i> example then he is much more insecure than I thought - if it was Rodgers doing it we would be laughing our asses off at him.

1295~~~
He clearly has a method to his madness whether you or I agree with it or not - he's been doing this for decades and probably knows exactly what he's doing.

1296~~~
Basti of course

1297~~~

1298~~~
We give the guy a chance to rehad, give him a contract, and then he refuses  to play. LvG is not the one who is wrong here. I would have not made it public, but I see nothing wrong with it

1299~~~
I could undunderstand the outrage if it were a fan favorite like Rafael. Who has proven loyalty for the club and given blood sweat and tears. But Christ who the feck is Victor Valdés <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Been here 5 mins as a favour and thinks he's the bees knees. He can feck off if he doesn't want to do what he's being paid to do. No problem with throwing him under the bus. Keeps the others on their toes. Van gaal knows he could have done that and got away with it while still sending out a message.

1300~~~
This

1301~~~
Perfect thank you

1302~~~
Finally an exciting press conference!

1303~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> best one yet (I keep saying that to every single one you post)

1304~~~
Van Gaal just uses that word all the time, but what he's actually saying has little to do with his actual "philosophy". The justification for this is that Valdes did not respect the manager and refused to do what the manager asked. Van Gaal finds that unacceptable, and rightly so. That's his "philosophy" in this instance, it's nothing out of the ordinary

1305~~~
Don't be silly.

1306~~~
What do we make of Valdés tweet? The "Respect" one..

He does have a point..

1307~~~
What's silly. If he thinks he's better than playing in reserves to keep up his match rhythm when everyone is subject to it, that sounds very egotistical to me. He's been here only 6 months after no one wanted him. If van gaal says he's been unprofessional I believe him... Hence the "thinks he's the bees knees"

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11743346/Victor-Valdes-hits-back-at-Louis-van-Gaal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ictor-Valdes-hits-back-at-Louis-van-Gaal.html</a>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Victor Valdes hits back at Louis van Gaal - Telegraph</b></span>
Speaking in Seattle ahead of Manchester United's first pre-season friendly, Louis van Gaal explained Valdes was not present on United's tour because the Spain World Cup winner "does not follow our philosophy and refused to play a second team game". 

However Valdes has taken to Instagram to refute van Gaal's accusations, posting a collage of his previous appearances for Manchester United U21s along with the caption "?...#Respect" 

He has also suggested that Van Gaal has shown him a lack of respect in going public with his claims. 

Despite ongoing speculation around David de Gea's Manchester United future, Louis van Gaal - who said that <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11743232/Man-Utd-news-Louis-van-Gaal-admits-his-job-is-under-threat-at-Old-Trafford.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">his own job is under scrutiny this season</a> - has insisted the former Barcelona keeper will now be sold.

1309~~~
Does he? As someone posted already, it has been seven U21 games played since the last time he was part of the squad.

1310~~~
Well you actually said that "Who the feck is Valdes?" which I thought is silly considering his resume. That's all. I'm not actually defending him, but I believe there's more to the story than him refusing to play.

1311~~~
Oh well in that case,who the feck is valdes was in relation to what he has, or rather hasn't brought to the club. Yes he's won stuff with Barca, but he has claim to nothing at United, and was an unwanted man all the way to November. So yes, who the does he think he is. It's not like we signed him as some amazing champion of all goal keepers, promised him first team football and sent him into the reserves just for shits and giggles. He should be thanking us for giving him a chance to get back into football. So yes.. Who the feck is valdes

1312~~~
I'm fed up with all this talk about insulting behaviour, hanging him out to dry, etc.

He's a professional player whos professional life takes place in public. He's a person of public interest. He knows it. No matter how he behaves professionaly he should be aware of the fact it could end up in the media. 

We're not talking about his private matters or his hobbies, we're talking about his job that he is paid for massively because of the public interest. 

It's fair to me that the reasons are made public and nobody could name the reasons better than the person making the decision, in this case LvG. 

The only IF I'd add would be IF Valdes didn't have a clue and really thought everything was fine, then it would've been wrong. But I really can't imagine him not flying to the States without talking to LvG about the reasons.

1313~~~
The problem now is that Van Gaal has done this. What if De Gea decides to do the same?

I know he doesn't seem like that type of guy. But you never know.

1314~~~
De Gea has the Euros to play for. If he doesn't play this season, I doubt he'll get to start for Spain.

1315~~~
Well I'm not particularly concerned about Valdes, he was a United goalkeeper in name only really and for only part of a season.  VG can't sell De Gea unless he has a suitable top class replacement so until that happens DG's not going anywhere.  Perhaps Ramos's girlfriend could get pally with DG's girlfriend and tell her that England and United are the place to be.

1316~~~
Meh. The story was only noteworthy in that it explained why Valdes wasn't on the tour and that he had been told to find another club. 

His #respect response just highlighted the fact  that his relationship with LVG is broken beyond repair. He's as good as gone and I'm not going to miss him.

1317~~~
Exactly. But we've got ourselves into a position where that's a genuine choice for us. It's up to United what happens now. We don't care if we lose out on the money, and De Gea isn't going to throw a tantrum, so if we want to we can just keep him for another season. And as you say, for a hundred different reasons it's probably a now or never situation for Madrid, so we could very well just end up keeping him for good. Which is obviously the optimal outcome, because he's the second best keeper in the world.

1318~~~
I've heard he fell out with Frans Hoek as well and was quite critical of a lot of his training techniques. If a player who has come back from a long term injury doesnt understand the benefits of match sharpness and is arguing with coaches then he has to go.

1319~~~
for those saying LVG is a ballbreaker, you can see he is upset and disappointed with Valdes when he is talking about it. Kinda shocked after throwing him a safety rope when he needed one.

What was Valdes expecting, train 2 hours a day and just be goalkeeper of MUFC? we had no Europe, no carling cup. he was doing feck all anyway was he not bored?

1320~~~
So who will? It won't be Casillas.

1321~~~
I remember Van Gaal mentioning a "twitch in his arse" a while back, Valdes must be the reason behind it.

1322~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This guy has way too much time on his hands

1323~~~
On the other whocif not DDG?

Demoted Cassillas? Valdes? Reina??

DDG is a front runner for no.1 spot.

1324~~~
Why do you think Ribery hates Van Gaal so much?

1325~~~
A one legged De Gea would still be selected.

1326~~~
Say that five times, fast <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1327~~~
I think we are discounting another fact. Van Gaal did not make it public when this actually happened. He made it public when he was asked about it in the presser. Which leads me to believe that Valdes is not playing game in terms of signing a contract with clubs that are interested in him. And this is Van Gaal's way of ensuring that he will not be a presence in the dressing room for this coming season.

I am sure this had been discussed internally before with no effect. Maybe Valdes had a wrong sense of entitlement that he is absolutely adored by the fans and hence can still be here even if the manager doesn't want him to be. However players who work their socks off in training would definitely not like seeing a lazy arse like him sitting on the bench and earning double that money simply because he played in the same team as Messi.

1328~~~
<b>LvG's verison  </b>

“I once dropped my pants in front of the entire squad. Because I wanted to make clear: when I make a substitution, I don’t do so for my own ego, but for the sake of the team. I do everything for the team and I use everything I can to illustrate that. My voice, my mind, and everything else I’ve got. This shows the strength of our team spirit.”

<b>Van Bommel’s version</b>
“I have to confirm this story. Van Gaal tried to explain to the team that when he made a substitution, he did so for the sake of the team, not for himself. He asked me to translate his point to the players, but after several attempts he thought I hadn’t done it well enough. So he tried to make the point in his own way. By dropping his pants. The players responded with laughter. Luca Toni wasn’t impressed with the size. Van Gaal just continued his speech, but later this moment was often parodied by us. It certainly didn’t have the effect Van Gaal intended.”

This story is funny as anything in football, seems like every player had a different interpretation and meaning. Also LvG carrying out a thunderous speech with his pants down, while all the players were laughing was something you'd pay to see, or rather probably just have the audio too <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

"Luca Toni wasn't impressed by the size" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1329~~~
Honestly that Bayern squad wasn't that great anyways. Too many players who weren't that good and obviously not the best of attitudes.

1330~~~
I do not think van Gaal minds that his philosophy is questioned. He even encourages that from his players. However, what he doesn't want is his players to actively oppose his methods by going against his plans on the pitch, training ground, etc.

It's not just that. It's van Gaal justifying his actions to the public, telling us that Valdes doesn't suit us anymore and hasn't put in enough effort to be suitable enough for us.

1331~~~
I found even LVG's facts sheet quite funny. And a bit waste of time. I didnt call him a big fat idiot though :P

1332~~~
I don't see any problem with LVG comment, he was asked about Valdes situation which all of us were curious in the first place. He might actually keep it discreet at first but Valdes's tweet about him back to training rather than look for new club might hv pissing him off quite a lot. That is really the difference between how LvG treated Valdes and RvP/Rafael situation.

I am actually surprised that Valdes who hv known LVG for quite sometimes still acted like this. If anything he owned LVG for bringing him to the club for rehabilitation. Rather disappointed how this turned out with his United career as I expected him to be our no 1 if DDG left for Madrid.

1333~~~
Sympathy for Valdes. Doesn't want to do a permanent Begovic. Or he doesn't now want to be the second best second best number one although come to think of it he was last season with Cech at Chelsea. No sympathy for Valdes.

1334~~~
Beauty of twitter, players have an avenue to respond to lies in media, even by LVG

Victor is a class professional, same can't be said for a loony coach

1335~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yea LVG got absolutely told by Valdes there, he showed him that he played in three matches for u21s, woah. Have you actually read the thread that there were more matches than those three and in those matches it is most likely that he refused to play? He's an ungrateful shitehawk, not a class professional.

1336~~~
If you're all right and he'd be Spain's No. 1 anyway, we could be in trouble then. The only hope I'd have would be that he wouldn't have the balls to pull it off and refuse to play for us.

1337~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1338~~~
Paddy Powers twitter account has put this up!!!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1340~~~
HAH Ando going for the cake.. 


Matchbook's twitter is saying he's going to Valencia for 1-year loan deal..

1341~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1342~~~
He's one of the best coaches about, if he thinks he know better than him there was only one outcome.

1343~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1344~~~
Valdes was already left out of the tour with reports of his agent looking for a new club.    So of course there were going to be questions from the press about it, just as some wondered about it on the forum.    LvG might as well have given the reason for it when asked, since it was obvious some falling out had taken place.

1345~~~
Just saw it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1346~~~
Still at the club then. I wonder if him and LVG might make it up, I've read that they have a very love hate relationship?

I hope he does stay, because is DDG does go, he's still the best option we have at the club to replace him.

1347~~~
He's more agile than Romero but is worse in the air, both will rule us out of any remotely serious title challenge if we use them as #1.

1348~~~
What's the deal with him then?

I assumed he was certainly on his way out, but he still seems to be around <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1349~~~
Falling out with LVG is a shame, we sure could use a multi-CL winning goalkeeper right about now.

1350~~~
Assuming that he didn't have a club suit on because he's not part of the first team squad anymore? 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/08/13/2B32E6F300000578-3190258-image-a-101_1439036289292.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/08/13/2B32E6F300000578-3190258-image-a-101_1439036289292.jpg"/>

1351~~~
Not given a nr should give us a hint...

1352~~~
This whole situation with him is really funny. He looks like he doesn't care what van Gaal says about him, he just does what he wants. They didn't even allow him club suit but yet there he is sitting with his mates. I am surprised he hasn't tried to sneak on the pitch yet.

1353~~~
Is that Nicky Butt in the suit too? So even he is ahead of Valdes in the packing order...he should get the message and leave.

1354~~~
He has such a weird relationship with van gaal, what the heck.

1355~~~
He got the wrong suit.

1356~~~
think he isn't allowed to wear it

1357~~~
You think? 
Maybe he forgot his suit at home though.

1358~~~
Maybe he just thinks it's a shit suit.

1359~~~
Off to Besiktas according to Sky.

1360~~~
It's a shame VV and LvG had a falling out as I think he'd have been a great replacement for DdG.

1361~~~
Agreed, I would have felt very secure with Valdes and Romero.

1362~~~
Although i agree with LVG 100% on the way he handled Valdes's issue, i am getting a bit freaked out wit the amount of players who now are against LVG. 

Valdes is a bit weird though, all the best to him.

1363~~~
This.

It's a shame LVG will not change his strict and stubborn ways as he's been like that all his life.

This may come back to bite us if De Gea leaves and God forbid an injury to Romero.

LVG needs to learn to chill the feck out sometimes, he's too bloody harsh. His way or no way is very poor for a manager of his stature.

1364~~~
He's not the only manager like that to be fair, judging by Ferguson's second book and the manager needing to have complete control etc.

1365~~~
Top notch! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1366~~~
Good for him. Still don't get what happened here, we brought him, never played him and then van Gaal got offended.

1367~~~
Get him out of the club as soon as possible. I don't like seeing him talking to De Gea. He's a freaking cancer in the camp now.

1368~~~
Is he even trying to get a new club.. I will be surprised if no club came for him

1369~~~
Agree with that. I'm glad to see the back of him had hoped he would have done well here but he isn't the professional I thought he was.

1370~~~
I think you're overreacting a tad.

1371~~~
valdes is hardly a saint...apparently he once left the team one matchday when he realised that he wasnt playing in 2002/3 under lvg...he forgave that, i think lvg was disapointed that he did it again

1372~~~
He looks like a Bond villain and has acted as such. Shame, very good GK and would have been a decent replacement for DDG.

1373~~~
Are we getting anything for him?

1374~~~
bond villain, cancer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> some need to chill out.

LvG knew what he is like, no surprise here. It is like buying Zlatan, i would give it 2 months til they would fight.

1375~~~
Free transfer according to the press.  Experienced but I can't say I'm bothered.

1376~~~
Game against Hull summed him up really, fine shot stopper but hopeless from crosses and a mistake seemingly always just around the corner.

1377~~~
Who besides valdes and probably di Maria ? De gea may get upset that he wasn't let to leave which to be fair isn't van gaal s decision alone. Other than this no other United player is against lvg. If you are talking about stoichkov ibra ribery and the likes, they hate him because he didn't give them preferential treatment. Nothing wrong with that.

A lot of players like him even from that bayern and barca team in which stoichkov and ribery belonged to.

1378~~~
A lot upset that we are selling him. Pretty sure many people would have been upset with us replacing de gea with valdes had valdes stayed

1379~~~
Di Marzio tweeting that he's off apparently.

1380~~~
He just changed his Facebook cover photo to a big United logo on a red background. Interesting.

1381~~~
What a weird man <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1382~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Keep him Louis.

1383~~~
This is a strange strange day <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think its time to embrace the madness of it all.

1384~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a great troll.

1385~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1386~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Literally can't give him away!

1387~~~
He's wumming all of us I reckon. Louis is in on it too. In a few days' time they'll come out and say everything's in perfect order and it was just a ruse to get in a capable backup in Romero.

1388~~~
He must be the wierdest player united have employed. Make him captain, he's the only one who can handle van gaal.

1389~~~
Awww. Keep him, he can be our new mascot.

1390~~~
The way today is going, Valdes being made captain wouldn't even be that weird <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1391~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So Romero, Valdes or Navas battling it out for the #1. 
To think it was De Gea, Lindegaard and Amos a season or so ago.

1392~~~
I wouldn't mind it at all <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1393~~~
Would not be surprised anymore. Today has been a rollercoaster.

1394~~~
Valdes taking corners?

1395~~~
This whole Valdes thing is feckin weird, its like having a gf cheat on you then desperately try to win back your affections even when you've made it clear you're not interested.

1396~~~
Goal keepers have their own way of defining sanity perhaps. I wouldn't mind at all if he's made captain to be fair <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1397~~~
Lvg has met his match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1398~~~
I'm just.. I don't even..

1399~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> seems like he got shit scarred the way we're selling players today.

1400~~~
Can he play up front?

1402~~~
In a surprise turn of events he will be the only player playing for Manchester United come September 2nd.

1403~~~
He is a different kind of strange

1404~~~
The guy is a genuine mentalist, I'm sure he's just trolling our fanbase.

1405~~~
I think he's hilarious!

1406~~~
I love this guy. He is desperate to stay.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I came in here expecting a deal had been done. Wtf.

1410~~~
Couldn't be any worse than the way Rooney has played this season.

1411~~~
He is better than Romero

1412~~~
I'm starting to quite like Valdes just for the sheer audacity of the man.

1413~~~
Might want to change the thread title to Victor Valdes | Clingy

1414~~~
He's like my ex. Completely oblivious to why you're breaking up with her.

1415~~~
Easily. Several times better in fact. If we had to choose between Valdes and Romero, Valdes 24/7.

1416~~~
We can keep him around to make Navas feel better as there'll be two of them that can't catch a cross. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1417~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's a character.

1418~~~
He's been very unlucky with clubs, hasn't he? First Monaco reneged on their deal with him. Then he signed for United, couldn't get a game and still managed to piss LVG off to the extent that he called him out from across the fecking ocean. Then he did a deal with Besiktas and they tried to move the goalposts. 

It's almost as if he might be part of the problem.

1419~~~
So with the Navas deal apparently off, De Gea not mentally fit, and Romero a bit shit, is the way is open for Valdes to claim the number one spot?

1420~~~
I like him.

1421~~~
Lets start him vs Liverpool

1422~~~
Is he any good in goal?

1423~~~
wasn't he supposed to leave for besiktas or something? strange that he still seemingly wants to be here despite van gaal saying valdes has no future here. maybe I/we don't know the whole story behind this.

1424~~~
Wait...he's still here then?

1425~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Has this twat not fecked off yet? 

I think Valdes might be mentally unstable as well.

1426~~~
I honestly love this guy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1427~~~
In hindsight, he's played a blinder here. At this rate, he'll be our #1 by October.

1428~~~
He's the #2 Troll at Manchester United.

I reckon he'll show up at the LVG's house tonight with a boombox wearing a full kit with Valdes 1 on the back.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/U2jYoF4.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/U2jYoF4.jpg"/>

1429~~~
If things stay the same, then I'd hope he'll be our #1 if Navas doesn't come in, at least ahead of Romero.

That said, he is not U21. He has no squad number. Surely if we want to play him, he'd need to be registered by 6pm today? I doubt we could just add him at any time.

1430~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Vald%C3%A9s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Víctor_Valdés</a>
his "current team" is a bogus one isn't it?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1431~~~
His honours list is insane.

1432~~~
Who's #1?

1433~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/so-what-could-van-trolls-surprise-be-lvg-not-a-striker-its-something-else.406759/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/so-w...-lvg-not-a-striker-its-something-else.406759/</a>

1434~~~
Still has unlisted squad number.

1435~~~
So... is he just gonna sit in the stands for the whole season? I actually like him, he deserves to be rewarded for his persistence.

1436~~~
He's bloody great, I'm still chuckling at the idea of him sat infront of his PC changing his FB cover to the United crest right before the deadline <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1437~~~
Brilliant.

<i>Double V only comes for free, but he's real shady, 
And as for LVG, ha you'll see, 
Slam your money down and get to the training ground,
Slam your money down and get to the training ground.</i>

1438~~~
He seems to be worse than Anderson in collecting a wage.. And that's saying something.. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1439~~~
This thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1440~~~
Wearing a United kit.

1441~~~
My guess is that he made some bad investment somewhere and needs the money, which might be why he initially agreed to go to Besiktas and then dropped it when he found out they altered the wage package, he must be on some good wages at United. I kind of wish we'd given him those 4 or 5 games ahead of Romero but then again you never know what went on behind the scenes. Surely if wages were not a barrier some club in Europe would find him an upgrade over their current keeper.

1442~~~
Not in CL squad. Seems like a change of DP didn't help much apart from saving him from our yearly sale.

1443~~~
If he had not pulled a similar stunt before under LVG, I would feel pity for him..but he doesnt deserve it..He wont play for us again and will probably be released.

1444~~~
Dont understand why we didn't move him along this summer when LVG said back in the second week of July he had problems with Valdes.

1445~~~
Bloody hell, LVG show some mercy to the lad. He clearly wants to be here.

1446~~~
We tried. Hardly any takers.

1447~~~
Ridiculous situation, none of us know what's going on but Valdes clearly wants to be here. Should've moved him on if we're not playing him.

1448~~~
And have 4 goalies in the CL squad?  Somebody has to miss out, might as well be the guy who is already out of favour.

1449~~~
We tried, but Besiktas tried to pull a fast one at the last minute, as I understand it.

1450~~~
Bottleless gits. I feel sorry for Valdes as he's fit again but not playing, and it must be extremely demoralising for a player of his calibre to be playing in the U21's. Louis needs to understand that. There's a difference between bad attitude and not wanting to play in front of 2k people on a Wednesday night.

1451~~~
We've certainly screwed up, ending up with all these goalies.  But given what we've got, somebody has to miss out.  I'm glad it's not Johnstone, it's obviously not going to be DDG, and neither would it be Romero, who we just signed and has played every match so far.  So sadly that means it's VV.

Lindegard must be glad to have got out!

1452~~~
He is a pro and should do what the feck he is told.

1453~~~
That's ridiculous. The idea of playing in the U21s is to get him some match experience after being out of the game for almost a year. Unless LVG did it purposely to toy with him which I very much doubt so, his focus should be on getting match time even if it's reserves matches rather than how many people are watching him.

1454~~~
Quite like Valdes for some reason. Maybe because he's apparently the sort of person who's capable of falling out with LVG before then repairing the relationship. That's a sort of mark of character I guess? 

In this case he's in the wrong though (assuming he was being treated the same way any other players would be). The only exception would be if LVG had made promises to bring him here that didn't end up being kept, in which case he'd be right to be pissed off. I don't think that's what happened though.

Still, I can understand why Valdes was disgruntled. He was probably desperate to play after recovering from that injury and is used to the highest level, so it must have been frustrating to be stuck on the fringes. Especially when he seems like a fairly temperamental guy anyway.

I think the real problem for him now is Romero, who probably wouldn't have been signed if LVG wasn't planning to ship Valdes out. He's already been replaced...

1455~~~
Feels really weird that he's still here considering how certain it appeared that he'd go. We've got the guy who was the goalkeeper for one of the greatest club sides of all-time just a few years back, and he's probably our 3rd choice. Strange.

1456~~~
Surely playing the U21 gives him something to do which is better than training with the keepers coach? But we can also understand that although he's being paid to train and to play in some non important games which means there is no pressure whatsoever, having played at top level  and is only 33, it must be boring not to have anything exciting happening and to get involved with at work. I in some way feel sorry for players like that.

1457~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he came to us (to nurse his injury and eventually signed with us) having some promise or hope that he will be doing great thing seeing that DDG would be gone soon. Keepers' life on the fringe sounds kinda sad if you ask me (not their wage packet for sure but still)

1458~~~
It's Victor Valdes though. He's won the world cup and the champions league. He won't want to be regularly playing for the U21's. Obviously, playing for them a few times to get up to speed and get playing time is perfectly fine - but a keeper like him should be playing at a much higher level.

1459~~~
Then why sign for us knowing he was always going to be 2nd choice and get little or no games?

1460~~~
He would be happy being the second choice keeper.

1461~~~
Seems he will be frozen out completely till January.

1462~~~
Basically on the open market since before the preseason tour.    Had two deals to Turkey fall apart over personal terms.    Rumoured interest from Spain and Italy never materialized.    He and his agent screwed up what should have been an easy transfer out.

1463~~~
So he would be happy never playing but taking a paycheck.

1464~~~
Victor Valdes is still just another player that needs match time to get conditioned back into the game. Unless you consider Victor Valdes to be superior than Manchester United so much so that we can risk match results just for his sake? LVG didn't sign him for the reserves, he had him play in the reserve matches for a very necessary purpose. Something that even Fergie had his players do in the past when coming back from a long layoff.

1465~~~
Plenty of other players played for the U21s that season, Van Persie was almost a regular for them, no complaint, Falcao too.

1466~~~
Are we allowed to release or terminate his contract?  As a free agent, he should be able to sign for anybody.  No point keeping a player that the manager clearly doesn't like to have around.

1467~~~
To do that, you'd have to pay him the remaining wages as a lump sum, or agree a lower fee with the player. 

This is why Adebayor wouldn't leave Spurs, he wouldn't accept less than the full 5m owed to him to terminate his contract.

1468~~~
This quite make sense. But the fact that he is still here baffles me. Why would LVG keep him on his books even when there are no sellers for him and he is never going to use him

1469~~~
There was a second factor; that his pastor in N.London told him only to move to the Midlands if he got a sign from God – funnily enough no sign came and Adebayor is still giving half his wages to the church in N.London <span style="color: #ffffff">God moves in mysterious ways!</span>

1470~~~
I forgot about that! Praise be! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1471~~~
Maktub <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1472~~~
He looks a little... depressed? Breakup/makeup. Lurking in the stands like he wasn't really invited, clothes disheveled, shouting nonsense. Maybe everything isn't right.

1473~~~
Grass not always greener, should've never left but we have a shite board

1474~~~
I find this whole situation as funny as DDGs.  The club don't even acknowledge he is on their books (but pay him anyway).  He tries to get a move elsewhere but no one is really interested.  LVG moves his locker to the U-21/ reserves team dressing room. He decides to show up at matches wearing plain clothes (instead of the club suit).  He finds someone who'll take him, but they seem to change their mind at the last minute.  He changes his facebook page to appease the Man Utd fans.

What's happening here? Does he think the fans will help him win the battle he is fighting with LVG?  Shouldn't he just apologize to LVG and get on with it?

1475~~~
If he was happy being second choice then he was only going to get match practice in the U21's and reserves

1476~~~
Was it really the board's fault?

From the outside it looked like he just wanted a big payday at Monaco (wasn't he meant to pick up a huge signing on fee plus massive wages?), despite the fact that he was having an excellent season and seemed wanted and loved at Barcelona. I couldn't see any reason for him to leave, other than money?

1477~~~
I think it's only normal some cantera players ponder the possibility of experiencing something new/different and Victor is certainly someone who isn't afraid to go it alone.  But the board, in particular, with how they fired his keeper coach and the team's long time physio impacted many veterans in the squad.  Plus, the way the board handled the renewal talks was unbefitting a club that prides itself on the treatment of 'one of their own' - of course, this is now par for the course with this board

Let's face it, were it not for pleading from Lucho, Xavi would've left last season as well and there were tense moments with both Iniesta & Leo's renewals too.  The board has set its agenda from the outset to dismantle everything from Laporta's reign and make it their own which includes the erosion of La Masia nevermind the FIFA ban & impending lawsuits

1478~~~
Interesting stuff.

1479~~~
Are we allowed to loan him abroad? Can't remember how the loan window works. Used to be PL clubs could only loan domestically (after Sept 1st, that is) but they may have changed that.

Not that I'm particularly advocating it. I don't really sympathize with the man. But then again it would be both pointless and petty to keep him around as some sort of joke if an arrangement can be made.

1480~~~
Nope, perhaps he has also learned not to burn bridges given the transfers that failed to go through this summer.

1481~~~

1482~~~
But why?

1483~~~
He's trolling on twitter again.

1484~~~
Warning, huge dick behind the spoilers.

1485~~~
Then again i think he's genuinely trying to make amends with whatever happened with LVG, let's hope they sort something out.

1486~~~
How much are we paying this guy?

1487~~~
With his reputation you would imagine anything between 70-100k?

1488~~~
Can't we just give him a payout and tell him to feck off?

1489~~~
This transfer has been farcical.

1490~~~
So he couldn't find a club and is now resigned to play in U-21 or no game time at all. How it must have bitten him for refusing to play in the same U-21 last season.

1491~~~
Did work out pretty well this transfer

1492~~~
It's ridiculous that we have not done that. 

Either Van Gaal makes up or just get rid. I personally think they should have one more talk, if they can't settle it then just get rid of him.

1493~~~
I really, really hope he works things out with Van Gaal. Whatever his limitations, he's a far better option to have than Romero.

1494~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This guy. I like his style.

1495~~~
Even though it was obvious his first season would be a non-starter due to his rehab? I would have thought 35-50k being hopefull but obviously not if he's refusing to leave. What an arsehole!

1496~~~
He is refusing to leave because he lost a lot of his money due to a bad business decision. So you can hardly blame him. Would you leave that sort of money?

1497~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Me too. 

Not included in the CL squad, straight comes a pic of him in kit saying that he is working hard. He is trolling.

1498~~~
I bet Van Gaal has ordered the United twitter account to block Valdes

1499~~~
What was that? Leaving barce? Im sure other clubs would have paid him a decent salaray too?

1500~~~
My preference would be this:

LvG and Valdes make up and Valdes becomes our #2 again, maybe with some cup/dead rudder matches to help him get a new gig next season. Or maybe not, depends on how he handles playing for the under21 team this season. Romero becomes #3. Johnstone goes on loan, because wasting him for a season would be terrible, I think he has potential, but we'll never see it if he's here all season sitting on his arse.

1501~~~
If only his commitment to the philosophy was as good as his social media trolling skills <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1502~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/victor-valdes-wanted-monaco-move-clear-off-debts-fails-medical-at-club-instead" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportskeeda.com/football...clear-off-debts-fails-medical-at-club-instead</a>

That should explain it. 

Hence why he ain't leaving unless we pay him off.

1503~~~
Why would anyone like that behaviour? He's shooting against club's decision makers via social media - it's childish and stupid, nothing else

1504~~~
Is this real?

1505~~~
Ah ok interesting. Still would have thought joining a club would be better then not earning appearance fees and clean sheet bonuses etc. Obviously not though!

1506~~~
Working hard is against the clubs decision makers?

1507~~~
I said this at the time, but my theory is LVG signed him to replace DDG, as the club would have know for a while back that he's not going to sign a new contract and would be looking to leave. And as we know Valdes and LVG fell out which which scuppered those plans.

1508~~~
I feel like there's some kind of 'in' joke we are not aware off.

Absolute farce.

1509~~~
I don't think it's the working hard bit he's referring to. 

Seriously, Valdes is acting like a dick here. Someone should mark his cards.

1510~~~
He needs binning off pronto. 

And how do some fans approve of this cnut? Lets debate that here...

1511~~~
Spot the odd man out?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/11/06/2B33837B00000578-3193255-image-m-2_1439271559687.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/11/06/2B33837B00000578-3193255-image-m-2_1439271559687.jpg"/>

1512~~~
Pedro has said that he talked a lot to Valdes about United and that they also talked about 'the coach'. People were getting slated for saying that Valdes might have persuaded Pedro not to transfer to United but perhaps there is some truth in that.

1513~~~
I can well believe there is. Has behaved so far like your archetypal snide and I cannot fathom why we still have anything to do with him. What's his contract with us anyone know? Whatever it is get it paid off and book him a fecking taxi.

1514~~~
Well he has nothing to do and maybe this is something to keep him sane? I don't see the message he sent much wrong.

1515~~~
My point was that Valdes wouldn't be happy playing for the U21's being the keeper that he is, so we should've sold him. Perhaps he wouldn't have been happy being second choice, but I'd imagine a successful keeper like Valdes wouldn't be happy regularly being in the U21's. I don't think that's the right attitude either but it's the way it is.

1516~~~
In fairness if one of my old work colleagues / friends asked me about my boss at a new company because he was thinking of joining and I didn't get on with the boss I wouldn't lie to my friend about that... Id tell him exactly what I thought and why and then let him make his own mind up

1517~~~
Not sure I get what's wrong with that picture? Seems like a pretty standard thing for a footballer to post...

1518~~~
Mark Ogden Tweeted this 

@MOgdenTelegraph: Quique Sanchez Flores keen to take Victor Valdes to Watford, but still some work to do on that...#mufc

1519~~~
Free transfers can still go through but we'll have to release him and he will have to agree not to take any money to actually be released from his contract.

1520~~~
Yeah me neither. Apparently it's dickish though. But then who's the bigger dick, the dick in the picture or the dick that brought him here?

Seriously though, if those 2 won't kiss and make up then we really do need to get him out the club as it will only be a distraction to other members of the squad.

1521~~~
Obviously it's not the working hard part which is the issue. It's rather his "trolling" and childish behaviour

1522~~~
I think so too. He after all had been working on a very high level and now he's being sidelined like that. I wonder what it would be like if he knocked on VG's door and wanted a word? Maybe apology or something. At least they should talk like grown up.

1523~~~
That's what I am most worried about. Maybe they need a middle man to interfere (between him and VG)

1524~~~
That's what I mean, I don't get how it's trolling? Think I'm missing something, it just looks like the sort of thing footballers always post.

1525~~~
Well it would be very bad business if we are not getting anything by "selling" him.

1526~~~
Apparently he's fallen out with LVG a few times in the past and they used to have some big training ground rows? They obviously always got back on good terms though given they seemed to have a strong relationship when Valdes arrived. Maybe  that's just the way they are.

1527~~~
It started when he posted the 3 games he played for the U21. Some other posts just come across as childish also with regards to timing. Might be a coincidence

1528~~~
Can we not just loan him for a season? That would be a free transfer effectively..

1529~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1530~~~
To be fair (and I am not really defending him) a strong character would not lie down and not let people know about the three games he played U21. His hashtag  was #respect as I recall. It's quite innocent (as far as social media standard goes! In the past one would leak to a journo or something...)

1531~~~
He has an 18 months contract

1532~~~
The initial idea must be to get him to replace DDG and they (VV and VG) knew each other's temperaments and must have already kissed and made up when we welcomed him into the treatment centre and eventually signed a contract with him. The subsequent "row" look very childish on both parties if you ask me

1533~~~
Sure, it's debatable. I found it a bit childish, especially considering the fact he only paid 3 games. Anyways, he's not in the squad and probably never will be

1534~~~
Despite the white text on my original post I'm pretty sure that it is, or the Telegraph would get in trouble for this: 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11837986/Emmanuel-Adebayor-refuses-to-leave-Tottenham-Hotspur-because-he-needs-a-sign-from-God.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...Hotspur-because-he-needs-a-sign-from-God.html</a>

1535~~~

1536~~~
In terms of merit, he should have been ahead of Romero, but no one at the club is going to say that. When LvG signed Romero, he should not be thought as first choice. His credential is more on his international cap than clubs. His distribution is always a bit nervy for my liking and I feel for his teammates. Anyway, it's unfortunate how VV became out of favour with VG in such petty circumstances

1537~~~
We're Manchester United: We have keepers!

1538~~~
Just read the repost from when he's being signed and VG said he's being signed as number 2 for United. 

BTW, How true is the Sky news tweet above? It sounds good news!

1539~~~
Is it too big a stretch to think maybe Johnstone's agent's comments caused this?  Or were his comments a result of this?

1540~~~
I feel that he did something very stupid and is now trying his best to be forgiven.

1541~~~
Yes because of Johnstone's agent's comments van Gaal lost faith and trust in Johnstone and therefore felt obliged to use one of his five spare squad spots on Valdes.

1542~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Are you telling me that's <i>not</i> how it works?

1543~~~
His inclusion means he could well have a future at the club. This is good to hear.

1544~~~
Anything that prevents lazy diving Romero from being number one... Get back in favour Vales.. We could have done with his experience and composure for our first 3 games.

1545~~~
At the beginning of the season, there were news Johnstone would be loaned out. Guess he's being kept because there was no certainty of DDG nor VV. The agent's comment might be as a result of insider information VV is in again. I look at the whole saga as a mess but maybe it's been all planned out. In any event it should be good news for VV to be in the squad again.

1546~~~
I have found him funny over the past few days, but at the end of the day the guy was taking the piss which really shouldn't be allowed. 

Glad to see he has been rewarded with a place in the squad

1547~~~
De Gea, Romero, Valdes and Johnstone must be the strongest keeping line-up ever.

1548~~~
Kissed and made up then.

1549~~~
If everyone is in their peak may be. Otherwise as things stand, I'd take Courtois and Begovic or even Courois and Cech from last season over this lot.

1550~~~
I think they did not include him in the CL squad to leave him the option of playing in the competition if some club buys him in January. Not sure which club in the knock out stages would be missing a goalie but you'd never know with injuries and stuff.

1551~~~
This whole thing with Valdes has been a hoot. Watching the goalies sitting in the stands muttering amongst themselves has been hilarious. You can just imagine what they're saying.

1552~~~
I'm saying in terms of depth. Usually the quality drops off pretty sharply after the backup goalkeeper.

1553~~~
Pedro quotes are interesting

Pedro admitted he was not impressed with how Van Gaal treated his fellow Spaniard but says it was United's dawdling over the transfer that made him move to Stamford Bridge.

"It's true that I don't like that treatment for my colleagues, especially for Victor, who has been a reference as a team-mate and as a professional," Pedro told Spanish newspaper <i>Marca</i>.

"I don't believe it's fair but it didn't influence my decision. I just saw that Manchester didn't take that move forward, that they were taking too long. Chelsea were more decisive.

<b>"I spoke to Victor a lot. He told me that United was very good and there was a great fan following, but that his only problem was the situation with the coach.</b>

<b>"But Victor absolutely did not recommend against signing for United. He spoke very well of the club. It's a great club but I'm convinced I have made the right choice to join Chelsea.</b>

"I had an important chat with Jose Mourinho and he said many things that I liked to hear. That, combined with the possibility to live in London, was what made me decide."

1554~~~
Really glad he has been included in the squad for the Premier League its a start for him to get some game time I hope.

1555~~~
As long as Valdes and Romero take turns warming the bench between CL & league.

1556~~~
That clears that up then. I wonder what Valdes said about Van Gaal, apart from the bit about him being a cnut?

1557~~~
This

1558~~~
#Freevictor

1559~~~
No chance he has a future here, dont know why we included him in the squad. De Gea will start soon, so i dont care who sits on the bench. I dont expect him to be much longer here at the club.

1560~~~
Probably smarter to include him in the squad so he keeps his arse quiet and not do too much bad mouthing on the sly to his Spanish mates. Hope they made him promise to not discuss any club related issues via twitter. Otherwise, happy if this just goes quiet now with him being included - had enough of the goalkeeping drama at the club.

1561~~~

1562~~~
No club in Europe has goalkeeper depth like us. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1563~~~
Yet Romero will still start against Liverpool.

1564~~~
This 'saga' just gets more and more bizarre.

Not one side is coming out of this well imo.

1565~~~
He looks like a different person with hair.

Feck me, this getting ridiculous <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What on earth is going on....?

1568~~~
Looks like that Dutch psychopath who murdered women in Aruba.

1569~~~
Thought the second picture was Iker for a second.

1570~~~
A change in attitude. Good for him. He had an ACL injury and like Falcao we picked him up about a year after the injury. It takes 2 years to get back to proper form from an injury like that (something that Chelsea will definitely benefit from even though Falcao is passed it, just won't be as bad as he was here). Valdes is only 33. That's 29 in outfield player years. He's got plenty left. Train hard for a year and who knows, he might get a lucrative deal somewhere or a chance at United if De Gea leaves. He definitely won't get that if he sulks and blames everyone. Probably doesn't suck that 3 out of 4 keepers are Spanish speakers.

Then again, basically every player was picked. 21 players and the rest is 21 years or younger.

1571~~~
Extremely annoyed that he is still here.

1572~~~
Worse transfer than Bebe.. will end up costing us more money and has contributed less... and that was a tough thing to do.

1573~~~
IIRC, we're not paying him very much money at all because Monaco are still covering some of his wages.

1574~~~
Why would Monaco be paying Valdes' wages?

1575~~~
probably because of <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/544922/Victor-Valdes-Manchester-United-Monaco-compensation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a>

1576~~~
Ah, well that cheers me up, the fleecing twats.

1577~~~
Have you forgotten schmeichel and van der gouw?

1578~~~
Or even Courtois, Cech, Schwarzer which the renties had for a bit.

1579~~~
Leighton and sealey

1580~~~
Taibi and Bosnich

1581~~~
We have a winner!

1582~~~
I really like him. Hope he becomes our #1 if DdG leaves.

1583~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-no-way-back-9992562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ll-news/manchester-united-no-way-back-9992562</a>

He was only in the squad because it was against the rules not to include him.

1584~~~
This is one big mess..Should have just cancelled his contract.

1585~~~
Nope that would probably be Romero (should we continue playing him if De Gea doesn't sign)

1586~~~
Release him on a free transfer

1587~~~
So we only have 21 players aged over 21?

1588~~~
That surely sounds about right?

1589~~~
They should have just signed up 5 random caf members on £1 a year contracts, so they didn't have to name him in the squad.

1590~~~
Yeah, guess so.  Having 3 or 4 regular starters under 21 and 3 or 4 more around the 1st team squad makes the 25 man limit a bit redundant.

1591~~~
Our treatment of Valdes borders on the ridiculous. If you believe Van Gaal then Valdes refused to play for the reserves. Is he the first player in the history of Man Utd to do that? We all know the answer is no. He's far, far better than Romero ever has been (or likely ever will be). Yet he's being exiled despite it being damaging to the team. Totally crazy.

1592~~~
He was signed as a reserve keeper yet he refused to play for the reserves...

Sooner he is out the club the better.

1593~~~
Who else?

1594~~~
It's all a bit silly. LVG won't budge and neither will Valdes. Are we actually paying him to plant his arse on a seat that could easily be taken up but one of our paying "customers" as the Glazers are pleased to call us? If the differences really are irreconcilable, cancel his contract, write him a cheque, and wave him goodbye.

1595~~~
Paul Scholes refused to play in a <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/15123433" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">first team game</a>.

1596~~~
I heard about that. But refusing to play from being in a funk (and afterward acknowledging that you were stupid and wrong and regret it) is a bit different from feeling so entitled--without having contributed anything to the club--that you feel you should be exempt from playing for the reserves <i>in principle</i> and maintaining that position, which is what Valdes is still claiming, as far as I know.

1597~~~
How come no other club wants Valdes?   His agent has been shopping him around since early July at least.    One, possibly two deals with Turkish clubs fell apart over personal terms (in one case the club agreed to terms then tried to change them at the last minute).    Seems somebody should want him for the very small transfer fee that would be involved.   Even a loan should have been possible but nobody seemed interested.

1598~~~
What about Big Roy Carroll, Howard and Foster?

1599~~~
It's probably his wage demands.

1600~~~
Lindegaard. He isn't Spanish.

1601~~~
Our version of Theon Greyjoy.

1602~~~
Not to worry Louis Van Ramsay is on him. Victor... What is your name? - "Reek *quivers and huddles by the goal post*"

1603~~~
Succinctly put and in total agreement here. 

What is preventing us from doing just that?

1604~~~
Egos, I suspect.

1605~~~
I was beaten down for saying this...

1606~~~
Rightly so, you said it in July ffs. The fact that he renewed was due to a hysterical comedy of errors unseen before in high level transfers. 

It's like me saying there's a chance Messi will sign for us and then bumping the post in 5 years time if we do sign him.

1607~~~
Many United fans thought there was no possibility of him renewing. My point is simply that the possibility was actually quite strong if he stayed at the club.

1608~~~
But the chances of him staying at the club were minuscule, everyone knew that. It was one of the most ridiculous transfer feckups ever that kept him here (happily).

Also, just cheeked the thread. There isn't a single reply to that post you mention, how were you beaten down for saying it?

1609~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1610~~~
Sarni, for one, replied to say there is 'no chance' he will renew and there are many others who have said the same thing in other threads.

This isn't a big deal it's just there are many who don't seem to understand player motivation. 

I do not agree that the chance of him stayin was 'minuscule'

1611~~~
Loan him to a team who needs a keeper and can loan us their LB in exchange. Some mid-table Spanish side with a crap or injured keeper and a good LB.

1612~~~
With the stories that are coming out today about LvG's orders (training times to not conflict with 1st team players etc.) it's very hard to see anyone coming out of this looking good.

Now the press are saying we'll cancel the contract but block him joining another PL club … this will not end well for the club!

1613~~~
What the hell is he still doing here? Why can't they just GET RID of a player like this? If I was in a house where nobody wanted me to stay I would surely take my stuff and leave.

Valdes, do you understand common people's etiquette??? You're like a freakin' baby. Just <span style="text-decoration: underline">leave</span>.

1614~~~
Even if you were being paid £50k a week to be in the house? (Or whatever he is paid, I have no idea.)

1615~~~
He should be able to find offers. Wasn't there something coming from Turkey? They're buying anything that has a name to it. I recall Valdes turning that offer down - he was happier being frozen out of our club it seems.

1616~~~
If Valdes is under contract, and the transfer window is closed, then what more can Valdes do but fulfil his contractual obligations?

He was on the plane to sign for them, but according to the BBC, Besiktas pulled something from the initial contract offer at the last minute. I predict it must have been something significant if Valdes didn't travel and go through with it.

The whole thing is just a mess though. Did we sign him just to keep him away from Liverpool?

1617~~~
When he signed the De Gea contract stuff was still up in the air, besides, he needs a place to train and recuperate from his injury. It was a deal that suited both party. He fecked it up refusing to play and LvG can be a vindictive bastard when he feels slighted, but I don't think we were that petty to begin with. What does it matter if Liverpool get an old keeper with a serious injury?

1618~~~
More likely that we signed him to do the job Romero ended up doing.

1619~~~
Valdes is is the victor here... pardon the pun. 

Utd plucked him from non-club obscurity, rehabilitated his knee, gave him a contract which no doubt includes a lucrative wage). LVG shot him down in public & essentially ended his career at OT in early summer, his crime? Not playing for the reserves. 
Surely this is a breach of his contract... and as such, means it could have been terminated with immediate effect!? Whatever is happening at Utd regarding this, it's a shambles. Valdes has been omitted from the team photo released earlier this week in another 'snub' from Van Gaal. 
Rest assured, Valdes cares not for a snub such as that, he's inexplicably laughing all the way to the bank!

1620~~~
We aren't paying his wages, atleast not a big portion of it. Monaco are paying the money, also I dont think it would count as a breach of contract. The manager has the right to decide who plays and doesn't, featuring in the squad photo, training with the reserves, etc doesn't count as a breach in contract. He's still a player with the club.

I wonder if Van Gaal would have been more inclined to agree to sell DDG had Valdes not thrown a tantrum about playing with the reserves last season.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>EXCLUSIVE: GUILLEM BALAGUE: The truth about Víctor Valdés and Manchester United</b></span>

<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>With goalkeeper Victor Valdes' nightmare at Manchester United showing no signs of ending, Guillem Balague explains how it got to this point.</b></span>
By Guillem Balague 2 hours ago  Guillem Balague

For most of his career Victor Valdés Arribas has lived the dream.

Now, for the former <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/barcelona/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Barcelona</a> goalkeeper who has won 21 titles, including six La Ligas and three Champions Leagues as well as five Zamora awards for the goalkeeper with the lowest goals per game record in the Spanish league, the dream has turned into a nightmare.

On the precarious tightrope that is football’s fickle fortune, these days he cuts a forlorn figure; ostracised, isolated and marginalized by the club that he had hoped to represent at the highest level.

So how did we get to here? How did one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game end up unwanted at a club where he is now forced to train alone with just a goalkeeping coach for company?

Much has been written about Valdés’ short but controversial spell with <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/manchester-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>, a great deal of it based on assumption, rumour and conjecture. Sometimes bald facts blur what is the simple truth which is that as far as he is concerned, firstly, he has nothing but affection for everyone at Manchester United, and, secondly he is 100% fit and raring to continue his career.

The position taken by <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/louis-van-gaal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis Van Gaal</a> is purely a footballing one. That Valdés should end up mentally bloodied and deeply affected by events will represent to him no more or no less than yet another example of the collateral damage the game so frequently creates.

So where did it all go wrong?

In truth, from the moment he decided that his days at Barcelona were done, the matter has been handled dreadfully; mistakes were made, mistakes that would prove costly.

Many months before the end of his contract with Barcelona, he had agreed a deal to join Monaco. This was at a time when the French side were very busy in the market, signing players like <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/radamel-falcao.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radamel Falcao</a> and <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/players/james-rodr%C3%ADguez" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Rodriguez</a> and Valdés was to be another jewel in the crown being fashioned in the millionaires’ playground.

Error number one occurred when the deal with Monaco was not correctly tied up. When on the 26th of March 2014 in a match against Celta Vigo, Valdés suffered a freak, serious cruciate knee ligament injury, Monaco had a way out and their interest didn’t so much wane as totally evaporate.

By the time of the injury the club had already started to tone down their profligate spending to the extent that they were now actually selling some of their previous expensive signings and Valdes’ misfortune presented them with the perfect opportunity to backtrack on the deal.

Mistake number two occurred when instead of keeping quiet and just slipping away at the end of his contract he decided to call a press conference to announce his departure. Barcelona were not impressed.

With one year left on his contract Monaco had wanted to sign Valdés for around six to seven million euros but Barcelona were having none of it.

Once recovered from his injury it soon became clear that both <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/liverpool/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liverpool</a> and Manchester United wanted him. In October he had the option to sign for either of the two clubs. There were direct conversations with <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/brendan-rodgers.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brendan Rodgers</a> and the Liverpool manager was certainly led to believe that Valdés loved Liverpool and would love to join the club.

In the end he opted for Manchester United mainly because of the chance to re-unite with Frans Hoek, the goalkeeping coach at United who he had worked with before.

He also knew that at this particular time <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/football/players/david-de-gea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">David De Gea</a> was thinking about leaving United to join Real Madrid so genuinely believed that United presented a better career opportunity than Liverpool at that point.

So following tests that showed he was 100% fit he signed on the dotted line in January 2015.

His arrival at the club coincided with an upturn in the form of De Gea who had been going through a sticky patch and as a result Louis van Gaal asked Valdés to play in the reserves for the time being.

Eager to get in some match practise and convinced it was only a matter of time before he graduated into the first team the goalkeeper agreed. Neither then, nor now, did he have any problem with the plan and as far as he could see what he was enjoying was a normal, professional relationship with van Gaal.

And then the walls fell in.

In the spring of 2015 in a reserve match, Valdés took a nasty knock to the same knee that caused no real physical damage, but still managed to give him the fright of his life.

Concerned that perhaps playing in the reserves might not now be the best idea now that he had regained his form he suggested to van Gaal that he should return to training with the first team and take his place as number two goalkeeper in the squad behind De Gea, which is no more than normal practise with most clubs.

Van Gaal begged to differ and Valdés himself is no shrinking violet. What followed was an argument for which the phrase irresistible force and immovable object could have been invented. The die was cast.

Van Gaal said nothing but before long it became abundantly clear that the goalkeeper did not figure in his long term plans.

But before then however, an injury sustained by De Gea in the closing quarter of a home match against Arsenal earned him his first team debut and at the same time confirmation that his days at Old Trafford were numbered.

David De Gea and Sergio Romero's form look set to keep Valdes out of the United picture. (Photo by Matthew Peters/Man …

Valdés conceded a goal that he should have prevented and despite his protestations that it was because he had insufficient time to warm up, van Gaal berated him in front of his team mates telling him that, while he might well have been physically fit, not playing in the reserves as he had wanted him to had made him rusty.

When he returned for pre-season training he found himself excluded, his locker removed and not even able to sit down and eat with the other players.

Meanwhile, if he needed any more convincing that his time was up at Old Trafford, then that was supplied with the signing of Sergio Romero as cover for De Gea. An official club picture was also taken recently and Valdes is not in it.

So where now for the 33-year-old keeper?

First and foremost, apart from any situation he may have with Manchester United, he and his legal team still have unfinished business with AS Monaco.

Valdés signed for the French club as a free agent in January 2014 for four seasons. The club’s unilateral decision to renege on the deal following his injury led to proceedings being started against the club in the courts of the Principality as far back as July 5, 2014. A ruling from the court is anticipated sometime in the next few months.

On the playing front, Sevilla and Valencia have expressed an interest but ideally he would like to remain in the Premier League.

There was talk about him going to play in Turkey with Besiktas only for that deal to collapse for a number of contractual reasons and Chelsea have also taken a look but would not make any sort of move until the contractual wrangle between the player and the club are sorted out.

The feeling is that Valdes has been the villain of the piece but in reality it’s just another one of those complex, convoluted footballing situations that could have been handled much better, especially by the manager.

It is also a perfect example of just how huge a part fate plays in the careers of even the very best of players.

1622~~~
Van Gal, his reputation long precedes him. Nothing new here

1623~~~
Eh balague himself says the van gaal is not to blame?

1624~~~
Even his best friend, Iniesta said he's not an easy person to deal with. Forgotten he's still at the club.

1625~~~
It sounds a lot like "Valdes was a bit unlucky with injuries and naive with his contracts, but van Gaal is a cnut" to me, just worded a bit more friendly. I mean, even the conclusion quite clearly blames van Gaal:
I've no idea what's true, didn't really follow the whole thing closely. But that article paints van Gaal as the villain and Valdes as the victim, just hides it a bit behind a lot of meaningless words.

1626~~~
Yeah but I think we also have to consider the messenger. The entire article sounded like a fairly accurate description of things naturally getting fecked up until the end where Balague needed to cater to his bias. Can't blame him though, his whole journalistic career is based on keeping personal relationships with Spanish players and their caretakers.

1627~~~
Yeah, completely kicking the player out of team is the right thing for van Gaal to do.

1628~~~
You can have him back if you want..he isnt much use to our reserve team. Its a pity the Besiktas move fell through.

1629~~~
Was De Gea going through a 'sticky patch' when he signed? I can't remember it.

1630~~~
No. probably the best keeper in the league at the time.

1631~~~
I kinda felt bad for him for a bit, but he knew he wasnt wanted before pre season (and that was because of his decision to not play for the reserves)
He had plenty of time to get a new club for himself. If he couldnt get a club, its on him. 

Forget about him. He'll linger around for a bit and then move on. Nothing to see here.

1632~~~
Feel sorry for him but seriously signing him in the first place was a big mistake.
Anyway, United has paid him nicely for doing feck all so it's hardly a tragedy at all. Move on.

1633~~~
Eh I feel bad for poor those with poor reading comprehension

1634~~~
When did this happen? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ray-Liotta-Laughing-In-Goodfellas-Gif.gif" src="http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ray-Liotta-Laughing-In-Goodfellas-Gif.gif"/>

That was for LVG to decide and LVG probably felt it was best for a goalie, who had been out for quite some time with a serious injury, to play a few matches in the reserves to get some match fitness back.

LVG ultimately decided to help Valdes out by providing him with a place to train and rehabilitate himself voluntarily and then decided to sign him to be the back-up for De Gea, thereby potentially saving him from being behind the hell-hole that is Lovren and Skrtel. And Valdes decides that he is now ready to make the manager's choices by himself and deem himself ready for the first team and create an unnecessary confrontation about it - according to Ballague anyway. I find it hard to believe that the blame should go to anyone apart from Valdes here, unless it was LVG sick sadistic master-plan, from the very beginning, to stick Valdes in the reserves for all eternity. LVG should have handled the matter more diplomatically after the confrontation but perhaps he felt it was justified in light of Valdes's actions (god knows what they really were though and I'm not going to take the word of Balague, who is probably going to be biased towards Spanish players anyway and maintains relationships with quite a few players if I'm not wrong).

1635~~~
He said that van gaal agreed to not make him play for the reserves and then when van gaal played valdes in the PL, valdes blamed his rustiness on lack of warm up. That's stupid from valdes and most top managers would have done exactly what van gaal did. He of course tries to add drama to the whole thing balague by adding lines against United here and there but the basic theme of this story is valdes seems to be a nut job who somehow managed to piss off barca, Monaco and United all in a year and now may end up not anywhere top.

1636~~~
That's what I thought. There was no way he was going to be replaced by Valdes. Mind you, there were rumours, unsubstantiated, that Van Gaal wasn't too keen on Dave but I don't think there was any truth in them.

1637~~~
Lmao at removing his locker, excluding him and stopping him from eating with the other players. How pathetic can a manager get?

1638~~~
He was cut, he isn't apart of the team. Why would he be allowed to act like a member of the team? It isn't van Gaal's fault Valdes fecked around all summer and didn't find himself a new club.

1639~~~
Same player who refused to play for the U21s. feck him.

1640~~~
So what? hes still on the pay-roll, treat him like a human being and not some outcast (an outcast presumabley on 80k a week)

1641~~~
For what? He is a nothing, a nobody, he isn't a part of the team. The tea lady doesn't get a locker and to eat lunch with the team either. He was told to get fecked and he didn't, not van Gaal's fault. Who gives a feck if he is on the pay-roll? So because he gets paid he can do what he wants and face no consequences? No, I'm not having that and neither is van Gaal.

1642~~~
Then he should be released. We're still paying him to be fourth choice keeper. It's so pathetic of Van Gaal. All this over not wanting to play in the reserves when we all know that if precious Wayne refused to do the same, Louis would still be up his arse. It's so clear it's one rule for one and one for another. Removing his locker, excluding him and making him eat away from the other players, ffs. It's more like school rather than a football club.

As above.

1643~~~
If Rooney refused to play he'd get the same treatment.

1644~~~
I disagree. This is a player who stinks the place out week in week out and his place is never under scrutiny. A player who helps pick the team. And the captain must always play, don't forget.

1645~~~
If you say so.

1646~~~
I do, thank you.

1647~~~
It's the footballing version of 'The Terminal' really.

1648~~~
I thought we were a club with a bit more class than that, fair enough we done the classy thing and let him train with us but dont embaress the guy in the process

1649~~~
Ballague has used an incredible amout of words to say:

Valdes didnt want to play for the reserves anymore, he fluffed his chance with the first team and now LVG is pissed off at him.

1650~~~
So LVG asked him to play in the reserves and he got scared because he got a bang on his knee and refused. Am I missing something? Why are people crying about his incredibly inhumane treatment?

1651~~~
How the clubs legal eagles haven't found some sort of breach in his contract and terminated it with immediate effect is bananas! LVG happy to pour money down the drain over stubborn arrogance, the entire Valdes situation is nuts... Utd's dirty little secret. Let's not forget, we lost Pogba over wages & now the board are happy to fund Valdes all the way to the ostracised bank.
Something seriously questionable going on there!

1652~~~
Valdes, never a problem with a coach.  LVG, history of fallout with a load of players.

1653~~~
No we didn't.

1654~~~
Still can't believe that Victor fecking Valdes has gone from playing in the greatest Barcelona side ever to being 4th choice at United in the space of two years. It's not like he's old either, he still has at least 4-5 years left at the highest level. Insane.

1655~~~
Nothing insane about it. He had a serious injury in the meantime and missed a lot of football.

1656~~~
Have to wonder what some of you would have done when Scholes refused to play against Arsenal. I'm guessing he would have been ostracised as well as fined and sold because refusing to play for the first team is worse than dodging the U21's.

1657~~~

That's a bit like presenting an MS Paint drawing as photographic evidence...

1659~~~
I keep hearing about the supposed high wages he is on.

Not disputing it, but have just heard different versions of it.

 - Monaco was/is paying a portion of his wages or all of it?
 - but then again, I read the player is currently in legal proceedings against Monaco, so I doubt they're currently paying/subsidizing his wage with us.

It's truly bonkers if we are paying him anywhere close to 100k per week though.

1660~~~
‘It is a shame what has happened with him as he is a great goalkeeper,’ Mata, 27, told Spanish news.

‘He wants to compete and has proved himself as a goalkeeper. I don’t know what happened between him and Van Gaal, that is something only they can say.’

It does seem very strange this.. It makes VG look bad no matter what way you look at it, he should have got rid or forgiven.

1661~~~
Nah it's just a case of a player who is a nobody at United acting like he is way better than he actually is.

1662~~~
He isn't a nobody though, not sure why people say this. Before he even moved to us he had achieved more than most keepers ever will.

1663~~~
He is a nobody at United. Even McNair has been at United more than him. He has achieved a lot but he was in a bad position before we offered him rehabilitation and a chance for revival. The least he could do is respect the manager and listen to him even if he doesn't like it. It's called professionalism.

1664~~~
its one thing that no one has mentioned, but for all his greatness only besiktas showed any real interest in him ....he's a waste of space here, and we should probably cancel his contract.

1665~~~
Probably been Falcao'ed after his injury.

1666~~~
LVG should be ashamed.

1667~~~
Acting or has the trophies to back it up?

1668~~~
They won a treble after he left..wit Ter Stegen who is hardly the greatest keeper...Barca had three of the greatest players of all time..with or without Valdes they were winning those trophies..He is honestly a waste of space here, and hardly anyone has kicked a fuss about it..even the media do not seem to care.

1669~~~
How are his trophies that he's achieved thanks to playing in probably the greatest team there was now, after a serious injury in a club where he literally is a nobody? Nobody gives a shit what he's achieved at Barcelona if he's acting like a bitch.

It's amazing how we didn't get rid of him yet.

1670~~~
Winning trophies isn't a proof that you are good. As others said, he wasn't the reason you won those trophies. No one is saying he isn't a good keeper but he is rated very highly only by barca fans. 

There is a basic etiquette that you follow when you are in a new club, especially when even after a serious injury he gave you a chance at one of the biggest clubs to prove yourselves  . You do what the manager says but he didn't want to play u-21 games for match practice and then blamed rustiness for his mistakes. he has only himself to blame in this. Look at falcao. Even though he wasn't successful I don't think anyone can criticise him for not being a team player. Played often in reserve games, was on the bench behind lesser known players. Yet he didn't create any problem in 9 months, didn't moan that someone like him is playing reserve games.

1671~~~
So you destroy his career? Insult him, belittle him, treat him like a non-entity? Stoop to sheer vehemence to prove a point?
He gets princely wages while being humiliated everyday. If we don't need him, we shouldn't continue to pay him.
Just terminate his contract with a payout or whatever. Please, don't blemish the class of the club with such cheap behaviour in the name of discipline.

1672~~~
As a huge LVG supporter and believer he needs to sort this out and treat VV with decency. He may be a disobedient unprofessional wayward egocentric prat. Probably is. But the manager needs to man manage and not act like a bully. Not good for the team or the player

1673~~~
Destroying his career is something he did himself. We were willing to let him go on a free to a club abroad since July. Which is a fair deal considering he has a year left. He is unwilling to reduce his wages and wants to stay in PL. he chose not to Goto the likes of Valencia or besiktas for whatever reason and it's not like we chose not to sell. If we have to cancel his contract we would effectively have to pay him close to one year wages anyway and he could join a rival and strengthen them. For instance Chelsea or Liverpool could use him right now. Which is probably why we told him to go abroad. Why should we strengthen our rival particularly saving no money in the process?

I think United did a similar thing to Tomas kusczak whereby he was forced to run down his contract even though  he wanted to leave even before that. It's not like we have never done this. This isn't a regular thing but it still happens

1674~~~
He had the chance to leave and chose not to take it. If he is being humiliated as bad as you believe, I'm sure he would have left the first opportunity he had.

1675~~~
It's a disgrace how he's being treated, really. So ridiculously petty. Just release him if you don't want him, don't treat him like a leper.

1676~~~
So what exactly has he done wrong to deserve all this? All I know is he doesn't apparently follow the philosophy.

1677~~~
Eh? When a player is released on a free, the agreement is signed by both the parties. For all we know, he couldn't find himself a club in the summer and now doesn't want to leave Manchester United, because, you know, it's Manchester United.

1678~~~
We allowed him a free transfer abroad. He demands PL move and isn't willing to reduce his wages. If we terminate his contract he would demand compensation and would also join a rival in all probability. In other words we pay him to play for a rival. We may as well pay him to to stay here. He refused to move to besiktas so it's not like he is desperate for a move too.

1679~~~
he got a knock with reserve, feared for his health and refused to play again. Now the real problem is that De Gea is better and signed a new contract.

1680~~~
If he doesn't want to go to turkey I cannot blame him

If he wants to remain it the pl we should allow him to leave as we clearly have no need for him. 

If you release him from the contract you pay up the the remainder no compensation

1681~~~
Never liked him tbh, not in the least bit surprised it's all gone south at Utd for him. 

The sooner he's a distant memory the better.

1682~~~
Bizarre situation. Can't really see VV clamoring to leave if he can pick up a 60k/wk for a bit of light training for the rest of the year.

1683~~~
We were basically letting him go for nothing. He is the one that rescinded talks with Besiktas. How is that our problem? If he was willing to go without a payout, we would let him go. However, he'll probably demand a payout on top of us letting him go. Its not us being unreasonable.

1684~~~
And what if he wants to stick around and pick up 50-60k a week for doing nothing? We were willing to sell him but he wasn't able to find a club. Not entirely our fault.

1685~~~
We can leave him to go to a PL club if we get a decent fee maybe. Why should we pay money to someone and cancel their contract to strengthen our rivals. No one does that.

1686~~~
I blame van Gaal for this situation, because frankly it's bit embarassing from club's point of view, but it's not like we are torturing him.
He is probably still earning lot of money doing nothing. He can always leave if he wants to, it's not like someone has put gun to his head and made him train with the reserves or something, he wouldn't be the first player to refuse to do it.

1687~~~
I usually agree with a lot of things you say, but I don't agree with this. Players behave far too much like primadonnas for my liking. Everything has to be about him. United took a chance on Valdes when no one else was interested in helping him rehabilitate. In exchange, he was expected to play the role of no. 2 keeper which under LVG means you need to play reserve games now and then to maintain match fitness. It's not like Valdes is new to LVG's ways of doing things earlier.

When he didn't cooperate, he was given a PL game to "show himself" and then allowed to move to other clubs. He didn't get any offers he deemed suitable and thus chose to stay, knowing that LVG had publicly declared he wasn't integral to the squad any more. That's his choice and his responsibility. I can't think of any club which would let a player who had behaved in that manner move to a direct rival for no fee and still pay out his contract.

1688~~~
Its like no player has ever been dropped from a team before.

1689~~~
now that newcastle have no keeper, they should be looking to take the likes of Valdes.

Clubs can still buy an emergency keeper outside the window unless I am mistaken

1690~~~
He should have never accepted to be United no 2 in the first place. That's not a role for him

1691~~~
They recalled a youngster from loan though, so  I'm not sure they are in enough problems to qualify for one?

1692~~~

1693~~~
Good riddance.

1694~~~
Thought he was going to Newcastle before that

1695~~~
I would actually quite like to see him in the prem.

1696~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://mexico.as.com/mexico/2015/12/30/futbol/1451496155_154074.html?id_externo_rsoc=CM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mexico.as.com/mexico/2015/12/30/futbol/1451496155_154074.html?id_externo_rsoc=CM</a>

Valdes to Cruz Azul is a done deal basically.

Would explain the Joel Pereira recall... Well sort of...

1697~~~
Wel done Victor, played us well tbf. Barca cnut.

1698~~~
Played us well?   Getting banished from even getting on the bench is playing us well?  His agent not being able to find anyone else to sign him when everyone knew he wanted out and we would be glad to have him gone?   At least two done deals falling apart and not because of anything United did?

1699~~~
Would've thought Everton would have been in for him tbh, Howard's a bit, yeah...

1700~~~
Because we know what happened behind the scenes? All i know is that he got his paycheck regularly and wummed around on instagram. We know feck all the reason behind him not being able to find a new club.

1701~~~
Or Liverpool. Both need keepers.

1702~~~
I mean what the heck was Valdes all about, it seems to me that LvG just used United as a platform to settle some old score with him, it was ridiculous from start to finish and has probably cost us £5 million +, yet LvG no doubt walks away blameless.

1703~~~
You are one step closer from finding him responsible for the climate change.

1704~~~
Worth every penny for the social media posts alone.

Not really, but for some strange reason I'll miss him.

1705~~~
Rather large step I need to take from him bringing a player into a club that he clearly has had issues with already, to finding him responsible for the melting polar ice caps, and general warming of palent earth... But I'll work on it as I'm sure he's played a role in somewhere.

1706~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1707~~~
Wasn't a bad deal at the time with the risk of De Gea leaving and Monaco paying some of his wages I think. Valdes decided not to play reserve games which led to him being rusty and conceding a saveable goal which helped drop points at the end of the season, plus according to jb he argued with the staff and things fell apart there. But sure, blame van Gaal for everything.

1708~~~
It would be interesting to find out how much money we spent on him. What a pointless signing.

1709~~~
My point is he has managed him before so should have had a fairly good idea as to how he'd handle things if DDG was staying, or if he as asked to play for the u21's which he actually did if I remember correctly.

LvG is the manager and it's down to him to find out if a player fits his so rigid 'philosophy', it's not like Valdes's slightly hotheaded personality wasn't already known, LvG should have known if he'd fit better than anyone, so yes I will blame him for this, but maybe not quite everything as you claimed.

1710~~~
Nobody else think this was a shame? i still reckon he's a decent keeper and could have been a stellar no.2 for us, and much needed competition for whoever replaces De Gea. Having valdes on the teamsheet gives me more confidence than Romero.

1711~~~
Me. I won't lose any sleep over it but the whole thing was handled poorly. Seems a shame that someone who'd won so much was treated like this.

1712~~~
A big shame. I refuse to believe it was all Valdes' fault either. He is so much better than Romero.

1713~~~
Wish it had worked out for Double V. We'll need him next season again when Dave's finally gone (& Louis could be too).

1714~~~
I go by a person's track record, Victor has been a model professional whereas LVG has had a history of odd falling outs and belittling of players.  Unbecoming of a club like United, IMHO

1715~~~
Would love to know he did to rub LvG up the wrong way (and i'm sure we will find out).

Not wanting to play with the reserves can't be it, surely?

1716~~~
If he didn't play for the reserves when asked, I'm quite sure the Utd legal eagles could have cancelled his contract with immediate effect due to a professional breech. The fact that Utd continued to keep him on the payroll leads me to think that's its the stubborn Dutch one at fault.... Yet again.

1717~~~
Wasn't There someone in the valdes unicef dinner thread who said that someone he knows at the club said the real reason was because he was undermining the coaching staff including Hoek and refused to train. I don't remember who but if that's true then The only fault of the club and management seems to be that they let the snake near the club.

1718~~~

1719~~~
Yeah this. Cheers.

If this is true I don't think valdes was the 'model professional' that people think he is. And not another beating stick for ed and LvG .

1720~~~
<a class="username" data-user="95869, @prath92" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95869/">@prath92</a>, its because there's no text in my post, just quotes. As much as you try you won't be able to see anything by attempting to quote it. Just the way the software works. I do get an alert though that my post has been quoted

1721~~~
He has hair now.

1722~~~
Taking a leaf out of Rooney's book, no doubt. 

No one can say his stay here wasn't productive.

1723~~~
Why is he still here?

Decent barnet though.

1724~~~
He always had hair though, just shaved it regularly.

1725~~~
Another player mis handled by LvG.

1726~~~
I know, it was a shit joke.

1727~~~
If there's any truth to what's been said on these pages about Valdes' behaviour (undermining coaches, refusing to play, etc.) then I think LVG has handled him perfectly.

1728~~~
How is he still here ? I thought Clubs would jump at the chance to sign him. He would be an upgrade to Mignolet at Liverpool for sure.

1729~~~
1. I don't think we would allow him to leave to other PL clubs without a transfer fee of at least £5m and he would demand 100k+ salary which not a lot of clubs can afford on a GK

2. Maybe they got wind of his behaviour through the grapevine

1730~~~
Based on what I've heard about his attitude I'd welcome him out of the club asap.

1731~~~
But it's only van gaal that has complained of his attitude is it not ? And van Gaal always clashed with some players wherever he goes. I don't think we would ask for a big transfer fee anyways, but the salary point I get. But he was being linked to all sorts of mexican clubs earlier on. If they can afford him, how can't the big boys ?

1732~~~
It seems he was having bad attitude towards everyone. There's a post in the previous page about it.

And Mexicans and other such leagues need a marquee player to market their club. Not so much in EPL

1733~~~
Because he's about to turn 34, has hardly played in the last two years, has been nothing but a headache for his current club, will demand big wages, and has never been a highly regarded keeper to begin with.

1734~~~
The wages I get, but it's not like teams can't afford that. He's better than most of the tripe in the big leagues.

1735~~~
I assume he's still here because no one actually wants him.

There's not even a rumour of anyone buying him.

1736~~~
That's just wrong. Remember all the Casillas love in during the early, mid and late 2000s? Valdes, for me, reached a higher peak during Guardiola's years than Casillas ever did and Casillas was most certainly WC for a while. Valdes did start getting due recognition after their CL triumphs over us and he arguably had his best seasons around that time.

1737~~~
Casillas was absolutely miles ahead of Valdes for me. The former was one of the best in the world at his peak while Valdes was an average keeper who happened to be at Barcelona when their outfield was making everyone else look like scrubs. They would have won those CLs with virtually anyone in goal and they effectively proved as much the year after he left when they played Bravo in the league and ter Stegen in the cups (neither great keepers) and still won the treble. Meanwhile Valdes, coming off his 'best seasons' and available on a free could only secure a move to the French league and last summer wasn't even wanted in Turkey.

1738~~~
The 'he could only secure a move to the French league after his best season' thing is blatantly not true.

He chose to go there himself, not because he was poor , but because of the cash. Its the injury that fecked him over.

1739~~~
For me Valdes was always a tier below Casillas. Valdes was a good keeper but never top class. However he was the best keeper for Barca as he had the qualities they needed for their tiki taka style of play.

1740~~~
Looks like he's off then.

1741~~~
Off on loan to Standard de Liège untill the end of the season according to several Belgian media <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Probably the biggest incoming transfer in Belgian football ever (if true).

1742~~~
Hope for Valdes sake it is true.

It does neither him nor us any good him sitting here doing nothing. It's not like we will ever play him again.

1743~~~
Class from him.

1744~~~
I wonder if his squeaky clean media/fan persona is a way of getting back at Van Gaal? Ever since their falling out he's posted numerous things about how great the club is, how hard he's working etc. Fan service, or genuine? Hard to say, maybe even both. But it would explain why so many fans are confused with the issue and are blaming Van Gaal. If Valdes has used twitter to encourage that then he's one sneaky bugger.

Still, i can't help but wish him luck in Belgium, so it's working. You crafty thing, you.

1745~~~
It really must have been a huge row between him and van Gaal for him to have been completely isolated out like he was. An embarrassing situation for the club but Valdes must have done something quite significant to anger Louis so much. Him joining us has ended up to be a big waste of time for all involved, shame really as he would have been decent to have around as back up.

1746~~~

1747~~~
To be honest, without knowing the ins and outs of this whole thing completely... i'll just view both LVG and Valdes as being obnoxious cnuts for not being able to remedy the situation between them.

Good luck to him all the same though.

1748~~~
Class from him, his anger at Barcelona's board prevented even something remotely similar when he left.  Looking forward to seeing him back in goal

1749~~~

1750~~~
In other words, Romero is shit so if LvG does resign in the summer (reported in various media circles)  than we have a good back up for De Gea

1751~~~
i guess its more "if De gea leaves, bring in valdes"

1752~~~
De Gea is going nowhere, Casillas will call every goalkeeper that Madrid targets and dissuade them from signing.

1753~~~
Utd really shouldn't let him join Standard Liege after their part in the Zeki Fryers transfer a few years ago.

1754~~~
maybe zidane will give a debut to Enzo or whichever of his sons play as a GK <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1755~~~
That would be Luca, Enzo is the central midfielder <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1756~~~
No one cares about Fryers, though.

1757~~~
Not about him as a player, but that cost Utd a few millions.
I'm sure there are more teams willing to take Valdes on loan and Standard won't be paying much of his wages anyway.

I just don't think we should be doing a favour to a team that helped us losing money.

1758~~~
More likely that his wages have been a huge stumbling block in shifting him. 

If we're going to have to cover his wages one way or another we're better off having the option to call on him in an emergency than just pay him off and gift him to another club.

1759~~~
I've not seen anything whatsoever to suggest we're paying him anything more than an absolute pittance (in footballing terms).

1760~~~
Enzo is the only one I know. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1761~~~
I wouldnt be so sure. Look at how arsey LvG got with the press for asking perfectly justified questions about Rooney.

1762~~~
These things are part of football. Liege just took advantage of the fact that we couldn't agree a compensation fee with Spurs after Fryers had spent the whole summer training with them. His contract was up and another club signed him. Don't see anything wrong with that and I definitely don't think they've cost us anything.

1763~~~
About time the cnut fecked off. I'll be glad if I never see his face again.

1764~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if Woody saw him as a former champions league winner and gave him a 150k a week right up.

1765~~~
Monaco were paying most of his wages apparently which is why we were happy to take the punt and let him train with us.

1766~~~
Why exactly do you hate the guy?

1767~~~
Because he tried to undermine the coaches and acts like a fecking prick on social media.

1768~~~
Oh, you believe the papers.

1769~~~
"He suckered every penny out of his last contract. " Wikipedia -18

1770~~~
Not seen the papers say that. They're going on the lines of mean ol' van Gaal waving his willy around and treating Barcelona legend Valdes terribly. Its caf members who said about the undermining/arguing stuff.

1771~~~
Why would he be on high wages? He was coming off a long-term injury, didn't have a club, and basically needed us more than we needed him. Is everybody at the club useless at negotiating?

1772~~~
Fair enough if they say that, haven't read anything on this I think. I just assumed.

My logic says that it's not true though, based on seeing pretty much every one of our players who left us got in fight with van Gaal, so it's unfair to blame Valdes alone in this and call him cnut based on nothing. That and him obviously showing lot of respect for United.

1773~~~

1774~~~
<b>I've heard...
</b>
I don't see why would a professional like Valdes do that. Not saying he didn't, but hard to believe that rumour.

1775~~~
That has never been in the papers. I believe people I know have trusted sources in the club. You can believe your 'logic' and I'll believe the word from people who actually work in the club.

1776~~~
No, no, no! <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>  More a case of another example why van Gaal needs to feck off as soon as possible.  I would be absolutely apoplectic with rage if we landed somebody like Cavani (which is being mooted and something I would very much welcome by the way) and van Gaal somehow managed to bugger it up with his excellent inter-personal skills!

1777~~~
Yep it was van Gaal's fault that Valdes decided to act a brat and defy Hoek and try and undermine the coaching staff.

1778~~~
Cavani is absolute piss.

1779~~~
Got to give credit to Valdes, all through his troubles with Van Gaal he's not slagged off the club

1780~~~
I thought I was the only one that was bitter about that.

A cnut move from Liege, Levy and Fryers. Regardless of how the player  turned out.

1781~~~
Maybe, it's in case LVG gets sacked. The new manager may want to use him as the no.2. Not sure he'd want to be deputy but the guy doesn't even make the bench under LVG.

1782~~~
Yeah yeah I get it...you heard it from somebody who knows somebody who lives next to somebody who was the gardener for somebody at the club who told them everything.  Do you have a definitive source??

1783~~~
No he heard it from me and I heard it directly from more than 1 person at the club. If you choose not to believe it thats entirely up to yourself but not a whole lot of point having a go at him over believing something I said.

1784~~~
I thought of this myself. I don't get why we wouldn't just sell him for a few million given the fact his relationship with Van Gaal is beyond repair. Perhaps it adds to the rumour of Van Gaal stepping down at the end of the season.

1785~~~

1786~~~
Standard Liege!

Surely he didn't think he'd be playing in Belgium when he left Barca. Nobody want's him.

1787~~~

1788~~~

1789~~~
Such an ungrateful cnut, feck off! Oh, wait...

1790~~~
He's got a great PR team .

Lets just move on from this sad episode.

1791~~~
Hamstring injury at Standard

1792~~~
They've cancelled his loan.

1793~~~
Should have just retired when his Barca contract expired.

1794~~~
So, he is back in Manchester? Poor chap. Hopefully we'll find him a new club this summer (or he can accept the role of a second keeper under the new manager, which is highly unlikely)

1795~~~
Standard: "We want to give youngsters a chance in the upcoming games. Valdes is currently injured, so we decided to terminate the deal."

1796~~~
Poor chap indeed, it must be hard being such a cnut.

1797~~~
His contract expires this summer and I don't think we'll use our option for a further year.

1798~~~
In before the 'LvG destroyed his career'

1799~~~
The turd that won't flush.

1800~~~
Wtf is this? Fm? 

I refresh my page and his on loan to standard liege,  post a post refresh and the loan has been cancelled? 


Does the guy knows teleportation?

1801~~~
Sounds like he didn't buy into Standard's 'philosophy' either.

1802~~~
I remember being quite excited when we signed Valdes. The thought of signing Barcelona's #1 to be our #2 was quite fun. Really hasn't worked for him post-injury though. Very similar case to Falcao

1803~~~
I'd be more than happy to have him back as our number 2, if he'd accept it that is.

1804~~~
Why?

Romero has been totally fine as a number 2. He's played well when we needed him, he's not acted like a dick and refused to play for the reserves, he's younger and will be on lower wages than Valdes. Can't see any reason why we shouldn't stick with him.

1805~~~
Standard!

1806~~~
Mourinho loves an established superstar, washed up or not. If he is the new manager, Mourinho might bin Big Serge in favour of Valdes.

1807~~~
Doesn't his contract expire this summer anyway?

1808~~~
I agree with this. Romero hasn't let anyone down when he's been called on and at this stage, I would say he's the better keeper.

I'm not sure what's wrong with me but when a player is bitching and moaning about being on the bench, I think he's a cnut, but now with Romero just sitting there all meek and happy to be no2, I think there's something wrong with him too.

No pleasing some folk.

1809~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxiszACcysY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Not sure if Mourinho and Valdes would get on, but if Valdes does stay under Mourinho it'd most likely be with De Gea leaving.

1810~~~
Because he's much, much better.

1811~~~
Those who say Romero hasn't let anyone down is obviously forgetting his horror show against Swansea

1812~~~
Didn't he do much better (2nd choice keeper levels) in other matches. Or are you suggesting no one should have a bad day at office.

1813~~~
No. Nope. Nopenopenope. Not even a possibility. Not listening la la la la.

1814~~~
I imagine he's saying that if you start a new job, go to work for a week and then on the fifth day take a shit in the photocopier then people will be entitled to wonder whether you're just a bit of a feckwit.

1815~~~
This. Valdes just needs to be gone regardless of who's at fault for the falling out with LVG. In fact, LVG needs gone too. Yeah, they should both just pack their shit and get the feck out. One way ticket to Idontgiveafeckistan.

1816~~~
Didn't he have like 3 or 4 clean sheets in his first few games for United? In any case, he has 6 clean sheets in his 10 appearances for the club which is fine going for a number 2.

He conceded one soft goal against Gomis in that match. Hardly a horror show. Even De Gea lets in the occasional soft one.

1817~~~
I imagine someone's happy today

1818~~~
Totally forgot he was still here!

1819~~~
I hope Jose tells him to go get the goalie jersey and he will become the new no 1.
Then he starts pulling Valdes back by the neck and laughs manically as he manhandles him..

1820~~~
Why? Mourinho likes him? Dont think so, after he tried to stop him celebrating in the Nopu Camp. Can pack his bags with Mata.

1821~~~
Right... is there a joke I'm missing or have you just got a strong dislike for Valdes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1822~~~
Valdes manhandled Jose when he was trying to celebtate with the Inter fans when Inter beat Barca in the Camp Nou.

1823~~~
Valdes can piss off, too.

1824~~~
Wasn't it reported that he was trying to undermine the coaches and cause rifts in the dressing room after his spats with van Gaal? He's got to be a goner.

1825~~~
He's become something of a joke.

1826~~~
The pre season press conference was pretty fun though. Thank you Valdes and van Gaal, great entertainment off the field.

1827~~~
Thought it'd be something like this, due to the post a couple below yours! I hope Valdes stays as #2 though.

1828~~~
Does anyone think Mourinho will offer Valdes a reprieve and he will be second choice next season?

1829~~~
Doesn't his contract expire this summer? I somehow thought so, maybe because he is totally non-existent

1830~~~
Double V back from the Belgian wilderness!

1831~~~
Don't see why he has to, Romero has been a good backup keeper. Less of a cnut too.

1832~~~
Hopefully his agent will find more takers flogging  him around Europe then he did last summer when anyone could have had him for a song and nobody seemed to want him.  A couple of deals fell through at the last minute over personal contract issues, which means he and his agent were overplaying their hand.

1833~~~
Hopefully not seeing he's a complete ballbag.

1834~~~
Has he not made like a tree and fecked off yet?

1835~~~
Has he finished my laundry?

1836~~~
Any rumored takers yet?

1837~~~
There were rumours of Espanyol looking for him, but there doesn't seem to have been any concrete offers yet.

1838~~~
so more of the same of last summer.

1839~~~
Stupid signing in the first place, both him and Romero are useless.

1840~~~
Hope they both leave and we promote Johnstone as our second choice keeper.

1841~~~
Shouldn't his contract be up anyway?

1842~~~
His contract ends on June 30. Surely as good as gone.

1843~~~
Yeah though there's an option of a further year on our end.

1844~~~
Can we get this doofus off of our books, please?

1845~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> love how this thread is his performance thread from last season

1846~~~
I am certainly not ruling out a Valdes revival!
