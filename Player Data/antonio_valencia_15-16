Another absentee so far. Though, still haven't played yet.

But something's going on...

Happy Toni? 50+ assists.

2~~~
Nice to see him smiling.

As frustrating as he can be, he is still a player I have so much time for.

3~~~
No idea why people criticize him as much as they do.. Was perfectly fine for the most part last season while playing out of position. There's a reason why all his managers continued to play him while fans criticized him, he just brings so much to the team even if his final ball is bad.

4~~~
Guy is still an absolute tank. If he somehow learned to cross, then he'd still be able to offer a lot, lot more than he does, even though he's approaching the latter stages of his career.

5~~~
I have a strange hope that the surgery he had to take out the metal in his ankles will turn him back into the absolute beast that he was.

6~~~
He looks more beastly than ever and seemingly angrier than ever tonight.

7~~~
Definitely looked like he bulked up, which seems a bit unnecessary considering how huge he was before. Could have got sent off about twice today if it was a normal game as well. No idea what got into him.

8~~~
He came on and just went on a rampage. Probably angry about Darmian outclassing him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9~~~
His best seasons were when he had strong competition from Nani on the RW.  Perhaps the competition brings out the best in him.

10~~~
I'd like to see him RW again.

11~~~
He doesn't have the ability to beat his man anymore, especially if he's shown inside

12~~~
Not sure what pissed him off but he put in a couple of murderous tackles in yesterday.

13~~~
I'd like to see him on the RW as well, for Everton.

14~~~
He's pissed about FFP easing from UEFA. PSG the main benefactor.

Well, I would be!

15~~~
Why? He's regressed far too much going forward. The only reason he is still with us is his defensive side.

16~~~
this isn't the thread for (name literally any other united player here).

19~~~
Did he ever say why he did this? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

20~~~
Liverpool player wildly tackles you in friendly right before the world cup where you are captain and want to do well to honour your dead teammate and good friend...don't think he had to! He lost it for sure but it was clear why.

21~~~
Oh yeah I remember how bad his tackle was now. Still no reason to choke another player, even if it is that little cnut.

22~~~
I think there was enough reasons to do what Tony did.
And I recall him grabbing his neck, this photo isn't photoshopped, or is it?

23~~~
With all the senior players gone, I think I will like him again this season, also think he will get more game time than Darmian who will be settling in but steal some more games from him than Rafa so Tony V will be more fresh.

24~~~
No. It is mathematically impossible to derive joy from watching valencia play. He is a blackhole of a football player who sucks all the light and joy from anyone who has to see him play.

25~~~
His season won't be in his own hands imo, it will be almost entirely down to how Darmian performs. It seems Van Gaal likes Tony because he is such a simple, tidy player who takes absolutely no risks and barely loses the ball - close to having the shortest average pass length in the squad, and an 89% pass completion ratio last season - and it is pretty predictable what you will get from him. Darmian has impressed me in pre-season but with more positivity and risk to his game comes more ball losses, and the extent to which he learns to choose his moments will decide which gets more games, I think.

26~~~
Haha,I just seen the picture and had to share it, the face on valencia also is priceless for such an unemotional guy on the pitch, but the reason bugmat provided answers that

27~~~
Hopefully he will do a really good job and Darmians boots will be really shiny ready for each match.

28~~~
Been on for less than 5 minutes been caught out of position twice and looking like a massive liability.

29~~~
Almost gave me a heart attack. Shite positioning once again.

30~~~
May he never start over Darmian.

31~~~
One of these days, someone will realise he's a liability at right back.

32~~~
Neither van Gaal, nor Fergie (who is the man that came with the brilliant idea) have realised it...

33~~~
You could see the difference when Darmian left, all of a sudden we were vulnerable.

34~~~
Got seriously nervous when he came on. He has very positional sense. Can we just stop putting midfielders in the defence?

35~~~
Oh....My....God

36~~~
Looking forward to the sympathisers blaming everyone but Valencia, was left isolated,  no communication, Smallings fault  etc.

37~~~
The transition from Darmian to Valencia was glaring. He can't cut it there, hopefully Darmian will become fit enough to play the full game each time.

38~~~
My favourite part was the commentator saying Darmian looked good in the first 80 minutes he was on the pitch and he was looking good in the 5 minutes since he came off as well.

39~~~
Yup, that was funny and absolutely true.

40~~~
In fairnes he made a couple of crucial clearances at the end

But was caught out when he first came on

Not sure it was a good idea to make that change at all. But if Damian had a knock I guess there wasn't much choice

41~~~
Hope he'd sub Mata, but if injury (cramp?) was in play, no wonder. I do wish to see at least once both Darmian and Valencia on the right.

42~~~
Yeah, I'd rather he be an occasional sub for Mata. No reason for him to ever start at RB again.

43~~~
Why on earth would you want to see Valencia do anything other than sit on the bench?

44~~~
Maybe because I do not have the same opinion on him as you do.

45~~~
I want to see him doing something other than that, like play for another club.

46~~~
The difference in defensively solidity when he came on at the end was absolutely staggering.

47~~~
If we can find another Darmian like type of full back than we should allow him to leave

48~~~
I wish we could give Blind his physique, the guy looks like he should be trying out for WWF. He made one really good defensive interception when he came on and he's had less pre season than the rest of the team.

49~~~
Darmian really exposed how bad Valencia is at defensive positioning.

50~~~
Nope. I am pretty sure Valencia did that on his own.

51~~~
Darmian really shower him up today. Nothing got past Darmian all game, and within 5 minutes of Valencia coming on Spurs skinned us twice down the right.

52~~~
Why does he still get games? Darmian was doing fine I thought. Hopefully it's just to get Darmian up to speed and it won't be a regular thing.

53~~~
It was said during the game that he was cramping and needed to come off.  Your question is spot on, though.  Valencia didn't cut it as a winger and now there's this myth that he's a capable RB.  I hope today showed everyone what it's like to have a capable player in that position, which we've forgotten after seeing Valencia cock it up last season.

54~~~
Exactly. Valencia not making a mistake was seen as him playing well whereas today was just an average game for Darmian.

55~~~
Will stay as a back-up RB. Will never reach Darmian's level.

56~~~
Nearly cost us the game on numerous occassions. Shouldn't play as RB again.

57~~~
Conceded 3 chances within about 10 minutes of him coming on at right back. 

He's terrible.

58~~~
He just doesn't have the natural instincts and positioning of a defender does he? Gets caught out of position twice within five minutes of entering the fray. He's fine as a squad option still, as he possessed useful attributes, but he should still be used sparingly while we have someone like Darmian on our hands.

59~~~
I've been saying for a while he's an awful defender when it comes to anything except 1 vs 1. The big fecking gaps down our right and Smalling doing so much mopping up are not a coincidence. Boggles the mind we let Rafael go to keep him as backup RB.

60~~~
Was pretty clear as soon as Darmian went off Spurs got a ton of space down our right side. Valencia's positioning when defending is generally very poor. I was actually expecting him to be subbed on for Mata and play on the right wing again as there seemed no need to take Darmian off. If it was cramp/fitness related then fair enough.

61~~~
Wouldn't mind Paddy being groomed as our back-up right-sided utility defender to replace him (and Blind relegated to the same role on the other side).

62~~~
It was just the first game of the season though...

63~~~
Terrible terrible player - his 9 minute cameo lead to a 20 minute defensive mess by the team - they must have seen him warming up. Darmian probably got cramps just looking at him. Our first 30 minute showing when they got in behind us constantly and almsot scored 2-3 times  was probably when he was at the front of our bench. Get him out.

64~~~
i fail to see what he brings to this club. as others have pointed out, mcnair is a better back up. even smalling is a better option.

and as useless as he is in the back, he's even worse any further forward.

65~~~
His first game since last season after getting an operation on a long term injury over the summer. Don't let that stop the hating guys, you're doing yourselves proud.

66~~~
yes, because it was only his cameo that we're complaining about. he's rubbish, he's been rubbish for at least three years, and we'd be better served handing out cameos to players who have a future in the league and at united. valencia at his age and his calibre does not.

67~~~
If you're going to hate on a player after every game, irrespective of the context of that game, well that says more about you than it does about him. 

You're wrong about a bunch of other stuff in your post but clearly too far gone to be reasoned with, so I won't bother.

68~~~
Nice. Apparently operations (this one btw was supposed to "free his attacking side" or something) affect a defender's positional sense. For sure it has nothing to do with the positioning errors seen in almost ever match since he was pushed to RB. 
But since LvG played him over Rafael, Valencia is solid and dependable, Rafael is rash and stupid, and anyone questioning that choice is stupid and blind.

69~~~
McNair is not a better right back. He was all over the place against Swansea.

He looked great against Yeovil, but so would Valencia.

70~~~
How dare you people hate on a player who has been shite for three seasons.

71~~~
Someone else who hasn't a fecking clue. Amazing the way this thread attracts them. Valencia was a decent fullback last season. Some poor performances but generally one of our more consistent performers. Sadly, that's the sort of nuance that escapes the mouth-breathers who gleefully tear strips off him after every single game he plays <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

72~~~
Man I missed your pompous "I'm better than you retorts" Pogue. I can sleep soundly once again now my fix has been got.

73~~~
He won't play in many of the big games this season I don't think.

As for hating etc etc, I don't hate any player. Valencia is, however, a disappointment - he was a very good winger when he joined us, but has become a right back who is positionally weak and very mediocre at distributing the ball. Sure he can tackle, but being built like a tank is perhaps why that aspect of his game is feared. I just wonder why he was allowed to get to tank level - it's not really suited to wing play is it?

74~~~
Is that what you're doing here <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

But nah he's dump. Darmian played better on his debut than Valencia ever has at right back. I'm amazed you continue to back him, he's a complete liability and when he can't rely on his pace he's completely lost.

75~~~
Youre probably right about this.

... But I'm still probably right with what I wrote, too.

76~~~
He was consistent for sure. Consistently not good enough.

77~~~
I just don't understand him at all.

There was a couple games under Moyes, notably the 5-0 against Leverkusen, where he looked like the Valencia of old and then he was back to being terrible again. He's gotten bulkier, but everything that he had going for him in 2010 like pace still remain, yet he is a shadow of himself. I just don't get it.

Also he seems like a very mean dude and then he posts a video of himself romantically dancing wth his dog. Which is another thing about him that doesn't make sense.

78~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I had no idea this existed, fantastic!

79~~~
Enner Valencia just posted this on twitter:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMTTmMyW8AA1N4P.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMTTmMyW8AA1N4P.jpg:large"/> 

Tony is a tank. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

80~~~
... But theyre not related right? Or are they?

81~~~
he's obviously not as good as darmian, but neither of our three rb's from last season are ( him, mcnair or rafael)...especially in their positioning as a rb...but he was decent last season until he fell off near the season end...

Going through his perfomance thread from last year highlights that ...for the majority of the season, he generally kept the naysayers quiet....but then from the arsenal game, the pitchforks generally come out...his physicality and speed are good traits and he can cover rb, cm, and rw

82~~~
His best game last season was in that cm/rm role in the diamond, we should play him centrally as he used to do it all the time for Equador and seemed to play quite well.

83~~~
We shouldn't play him anywhere.

84~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> we haven't been this strong in the centre of the park in a generation, why the hell would we put our most limited player there? at whose expense?

85~~~
Hopefully this will be a very short thread over the season <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

86~~~
I didn't say replace anyone with him, don't put words in my mouth. I said we should play him there as he is wasted on the wing as he has nothing to add there nowadays and defensively he is a liability. He's a squad player ffs.

87~~~
Don't get the he is obviously not as good as Darmian or that Darmian is a far better rb comments after just one game for us. He well could be, seeing that's his natural position and he's learned his football as a defender. However, lots of players have had excellent one off games and well players like Evra / Vidic had terrible starts and in neither case did one game tell us everything about the player. While I am also in the camp of am glad Darmian is here and I can see him offering more in the position that Valencia has, he has a lot to prove before it can be said he is a better option.

Valencia has provided consistency at quite a high level in whichever role he has played, winger, wingback or tradtional rightback. He is not a world beater at RB but, he has did a better than average job for us last season despite his flaws positionally. There is a big difference between being shit and great. Tony has never been shit for us at rightback - just not been able to become great and that's not for lack of effort on his part. At least respect that when talking about his performances.

88~~~
i'll re-word it. if valencia is on the pitch, it would mean someone else isn't. who would not be worthy of being on the pitch, if he is?

89~~~
Again, I didn't say he should replace anyone I said we should try him out there. I didn't say as first choice. That's a stupid question to ask.

90~~~
I wouldn't mind having Valencia in the team ahead of Darmian against Agbonlahor simply due to his pace and strength.

91~~~
Will be a good test for Darmian but he's earned the right to start.

92~~~
He looked very good against Tottenham, for sure, but they don't have those rapid wingers who are great at dribbling and running against defenders anymore (which used to be their trademark, just like United).

93~~~
Agbonlahor's rapid but I don't think he's any good at dribbling. Will be a good test for Darmian all the same. Looking forward to see how he copes.

94~~~
Indeed. I believe I recall Rafael always having good spells against him, but then again, he was rapid too - used to keep up with Bale on occasions. When Agbonlahor is on song, he's pretty good at just knocking it past and running. Dribbling is definitely not his forte.

95~~~
Agbonlahor isn't as fast as he used to be now he's put weight on. Astonishing that he's still playing at this level when you consider it was literally his only attribute.

96~~~
He's still rapid, and he shed some of that weight some time ago. He's lost agility though.

97~~~
Just why the feck do we still bother with him? Created several 1 on 1s for him and all he does he stand still and pass it side or back.

98~~~
Another vintage performance.

99~~~
That was absolutely awful. Comes on against a guy thats been running back to his own goal the whole game and didn't try to take him on once. Utterly pointless.

100~~~
Is his takeon game completely gone? Still has pace yet chooses to standup two crosses when isolated with a fullback who has played 75 minutes more than him. One cross he couldn't even shape properly for, it was more like a hoof into the box.

101~~~
Sad thing is, his crossing was a big improvement over Darmian.

102~~~
What was he going to bring that changed the game? He does nothing Darmian can't do and better. Darmian didn't look tired compared to some other players either.

103~~~
Absolutely rubbish, would be delighted if I never saw him play for United again. Can't believe we sold Rafael and kept him. He can't beat a man, he can't cross and he is average at best defensively. It's so painful watching him, it's so easy to defend against him.

True Darmian's crossing was poor, but Valencia's wasn't any better at all. Certainly not a big improvement. At least Darmian went past the left back a few times

104~~~
I can see why LvG tried him as Darmian wasted several good openings and we had an in on that side, sadly he was no better in exploiting it.

105~~~
Possibly the most cowardly performance I've see from someone in a United shirt.

106~~~
All he does is pass back.

Don't know what went through his mind when he decided that crossing to depay might be effective

107~~~
People are saying all he does is pass back..meanwhile Darmian only had ONE take on..and he failed. At least Valencia did offer better crossing.

108~~~
No he didn't. Stop spewing constant crap from your computer. Darmian made a lot of good runs, but much like the rest of our players lacked the end ball when the ball fell to him.

109~~~
He genuinely doesn't realise that he is fast.

110~~~
I think he still knows that he is fast;however, I think he also realizes that his balls off the dribble aren't that great..

111~~~
Surprised by some of the venom here. He almost won the game. Was an excellent block by Collocini to deny him. Got a few decent crosses in too. Darmian was knackered. As long as there's no defending to do Valencia is fine.

Only problem with bringing him on is that he was the last sub and less likely to make an impact than Herrera or even Young.

112~~~
Uhh, that's pretty much what I said? Maybe read my post properly.

Thanks for attacking me though, great stuff.

113~~~
I guess I need to rewatch the last 10 minutes or so because I don't agree with any of that. I can't remember a single good cross

114~~~
No. That is not what you said.
You said that Valencia could not beat a man then said that Darmian got passed the left back a few times. Making good runs is not the same as taking a man on and beating him. Darmian attempted one take on, and failed.

115~~~
I understand why we brought him on but surely he wasn't following instructions. Kept coming inside and still reluctant to put a cross in. Can't help but feel young would have done better

116~~~
Well it is true. Antonio Valencia continued his build up play and almost got the winning goal if Colocini was not in the way.
Antonio Valencia attempted 3 crosses and 1 of them was completed.

117~~~
That's always the most misleading stat.  A cross can be good without being "completed" and vice versa.

118~~~
Aargh, I'd have thought a completed cross is simply one which isn't "blocked"? Or does it actually mean, a cross that finds a teammate? Then it is misleading indeed.

119~~~
Didn't have the sort of impact I was hoping for.

120~~~
Apart from a good blocked shot that is. Darmian is tice as good defensively but offensively he has much room to improve.

121~~~
It;s a rubbish no-context stat.

122~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you mean that cross that was over hit and floated to the other side of the box? People need to open their bloody eyes and watch the game, not look at stats. 

There was no hoping on my part, just dismayed resignation.

123~~~
The guy is a complete coward is the issue. He's not been remotely good for 3 years and yet is still at the club and still getting minutes. He refuses to take any risk or any responsibility in attack. All the room in the world to take on his man and get something in from a decent position, win a free kick, anything. What does he do? Play the ball backwards and loft in three aimless percentage balls to the back post from deep. It's not even like he put any shape or whip on it. He shouldn't be getting on the pitch ahead of Young. He shouldn't still be at the club.

124~~~
That is true. But usually 70% of the time it isnt really.

125~~~
You mean the one that didn't was one of his bad crosses that was put  in the box? The one that connected wasn't did not really lead to anything significant, but hey at least he found his target.

In regards to your comment about statistics I would agree with you, but one thing you should notice is that the human eye can not pay attention to that many things at once, I wish it did, but it dosen't and that is what leads to controversy, that is why statistics can come in handy at times, some times it dosen't.

126~~~
When did you see Darmian do any of that?.... Just asking.

127~~~
My take on Valencia's the same as Rooney; if we're lavishing praise on them for doing the basics of what's expected, they should be dropped. Valencia's just a coward. No willingness to run at his man, too one footed to be of any use, and doesn't want to use his pace.

Have you not been watching Darmian at all? Granted his crossing game needs improvement but we get so much more out of him threatening the right flank. He's willing to run at his man and make the overlap and make something happen.

128~~~
I fecking hate this. It seems to be the 'in' word, along side 'disgrace'.

A coward would be someone who fakes injury to get subbed, not putting the effort in, not giving their best for the team etc that's a coward, not a players footballing ability. 

I find Valencia as frustrating as anyone but he gives his all, gets on with the job while playing the majority of his time out of position, matches every single player physically, that's is not the behavior of a coward in my opinion.

129~~~
Does he really give his all? We've all seen him beat his man on the wing before; he's more than capable of it, one footedness notwithstanding. He doesn't even try now. That's not giving your best.

130~~~
Far too easy to sit back and question someone's effort when they dont fulfill your expectations. 

Can you please tell me what van Gaal's instruction to Valencia when one on one?

131~~~
I'm very sure it would be the exact same for Darmian who actually tries to take his man on. Don't be stupid putting this on LVG's instructions.

132~~~
So Mata has the same instruction as Memphis or Young?

133~~~
No but I'd imagine the fullbacks do. Especially since width is a core tenet of LVG's philosophy. Of course I have no idea what LVG is saying in the dressing room but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that his fullbacks are meant to provide offensive contributions. It's one of the reasons he went with that 3-5-2 we so hated; so that the wing backs could attack and provide the width. 

I'd much prefer to see Depay on the left, Mata behind Hernandez, and Lingard on the right

134~~~
Valencia was first choice RB last season, if everyone was fit, it would be him. If he wasn't doing what van Gaal wanted, that wouldn't have been the case. So I think it's clear he is carrying out van Gaal's instructions otherwise he would get the Herrera treatment of last season.

I agree that he should be contributing more in attack but he would be the hero this week if his shot wasn't blocked late on.

135~~~
Valencia was first choice because he was the only choice. Yea he would've been the hero but so might have Smalling or Carrick or Chicharito been, I agree. But that blocked chance doesn't distract anyone from the fact that he isn't doing his job on the wing. Not to the best of his ability anyway. And this is in no way related to form; he isn't even trying to make something happen most of the time.

136~~~
His job isn't the wing, his job is to give it to and support the winger. Sure, he needs to do more than that when required but does a sideways pass make him a coward? No, a coward is someone like Di Maria throwing the towel in.

137~~~
Ok fair point about Di Maria <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

A sideways pass doesn't make him a coward, but he does it whenever we create 1 on 1s for him which he should be taking. THAT, in my opinion, is being afraid to take on a man.

138~~~
I'm sure he said Tony, I want you to always pick the easy option, if you see an opportunity to make somethng happen, I don't want you to take it. He was brought on because Darmian wax fecked. The reason he was first choice last season was because Van Gaal didn't like Rafael, not because AV was brilliant, hence why his replacement was brought in this window.

This blocked shot has been brought up a few times, like he created this chance, it was happened to fall where he was standing, that's it.

139~~~
Darmian dosen't take anybody on except for once in which he failed. He dosen't run at his man. Stop lying to yourself. He took his  He does exactly what Valencia does and he makes runs  to put himself into dangerous positions, I saw Valencia do the same thing last year. I'm yet to see any end product from Darmian on the offensive end. That being said, bar this past game I have been very very satisfied with him on the defensive end. Darmian is still young and developing, the end product will come and when it does he will be the best;until then, lets not lie to ourselves that Darmian has been doing well offensively.

140~~~
Lying to myself? Watch our games again. He's always willing to make the overlap and push for the cross. We all agree that his end product needs improvement but what he offers is a far more threat than Valencia does with his constant cutting back and refusng to run at his man. And yes, Darmian does attempt to run at his man far more than Valencia does. I might be biased but I notice it far more.

You really are trying to hammer home this stat aren't you? I don't know where you got it from, as he was fouled twice in the opening minutes taking players on and the last thing he did before being subbed was try to take a player on so that's at least 3, he also got to the byline at least 3 times. Still, don't let that effect your whoscored based opinion.

142~~~
I'm not a big Valencia fan but I didn't like the 'jeers' when he came on for the last 10 mins. Every time he got the ball there were jeers from a good number of he crowd.  We shouldn't be doing that.

143~~~
As much as people don't like him, he's a very good option for the squad. I'm almost curious to see him on the right wing in place of Mata for a game or two to see how we do with that extra dimension, despite being the far inferior footballer of course.

Anyway, I believe we need him to start RB against Swansea on Sunday. He can nullify the threat of Montero, an if we can disarm that - I don't see them having enough to hurt us. Shelvey is a threat from midfield, but now we have added Morgan, I expect us to cope with that.

144~~~
Surprises me he's still getting such a rough ride. I was as critical of him as anyone when he seemed to have a monopoly on the right-wing but I thought he was very solid at right-back last season. People talk a lot about the Mata-Herrera partnership but they're forgetting that it was actually a triangle where Valencia was really important in maintaining the width better than Darmian has done so far.

I think Darmian looks like a good signing but it was a bit hard on Valencia to even pursue a right-back. I thought he did his job more than well enough last season to make it a low priority.

145~~~
No top team going who should be aiming for major titles will achieve anything with Antonio Valencia as their RB, he wouldn't make it into most mid-table teams, let alone the top tier.

146~~~
Considering Fellaini is no considered as a striker than we should play Valencia as a winger. He may well end up our main assist man

147~~~
This is the standard to which our players should be held at. A little harsh to say mid table clubs wouldn't have him, but he certainly would never be first choice at any top tier team. Never ever. 

If we're talking about playing on the right wing, I'd say Mahrez at Leicester shits all over him in terms of attacking threat.

148~~~
i alwats laugh at this 'no top team ' thing that is spouted here..,even the best teams have good squad players that dill their ranks and fo their bit when called upon...even barca for example have someone like roberto, fergie's great sides had people like phil neville and o'shea...in the 99 ucl final without two first team midfielders we had to bring in squad players, that came in and did a satisfactory job..

I for one believe that one of the reasons that Valencia is hated is the fact that Rafael got benched over him..too many fanboys

149~~~
This. There's some ungrateful swines on this forum. Turning on our players is just stupid. It's as if people think we should have 25 Schweinsteigers/Smallings/DDG in our squad. Clubs don't work like that. Valencia is an excellent squad player for us and has shown his versatility on plenty of occasions. He hasn't moaned for playing at RB - not publicly at least, and he always seems to try his hardest. 

feck the haters.

150~~~
The top teams argument is banded about based on the fact that he wouldn't be a <b>first choice</b>. Nobody said anything about squad player. If he is a squad player it is because he plainly isn't good enough to be number one for a team looking to be in the top tier.

151~~~
Does Fellaini have a knack for getting his head to crosses smashed at knee height that doesn't get past the first defender?<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

152~~~
This isn't any whoscored based opinion, I didn't see much runs at man at all, Darmian uses his superior tactical awareness and inteligence to pick out the good runs and overlaps. Nothing wrong with that as long as you have end product( which we know is still developing).
What I said came from my eyes not statistics mind you. Darmian dosen't really
Just like Valencia.... That is not the same as running at his man. For me, Valencia and Darmian have produced almost exactly the same offensively. Both have done things better than each other but they are compatible. The difference is that Darmian has promise while Valencia has reached his peak. (This opinion could change as I have not seen the latest Club Brugge game yet)

153~~~
Well. That does it for me. I'm out.

154~~~
^Lol. To be fair, if we was to be to harsh then yes for all the positions Darmian has taken, his end product has been lacking. He's either picked out a neither here or there pass or taking too long to smash one across the 6 yard box. His movement off the ball is a mixture of good to acceptable (i.e a proper runner like Clyne, Coleman, Rafael etc would be running rings on the right with Mata providing the balls but of course we wouldn't have that solidarity at the back).

That's the very harsh line though because I think it's taking all his energy to be this involved defensively and offensively. Not to mention he's played less than 10 games with his team mates.

155~~~
I agree with you. I've stated many times here that I think his end product needs improvement but that can be worked on. And yet his attacking impetus gives us far more than Valencia's fear of attacking. His defensive contributions I don't even have to mention that they're way better.

156~~~
Might be interesting given that Valencia is Montero's idol and mentor.  Wonder if he'll go at him as aggressively as he has other fullbacks in the league.

157~~~
I just don't understand what the hell his problem is. He was a damn good winger and it's not like he lost the abilities he did have in those days. He's still got his pace and the leg injury is a non issue because he played well after he came back from it. It's not coaching either because he was the same under Moyes as he is with LvG. For whatever reason he is reluctant to try anything positive. It's a shame for us because we could use a good right winger in the squad. Maybe he needs to see a psychiatrist.

158~~~
Yup and hear me out here...but Valencia should absolutely fill in for Darmian from time to time. Like maybe even tommorow. Not neccessarily because of Montero but I think these games will take it's toll on Darmian (mentally and physically). 

As this is a Valencia thread though, I hope LVG can give Tony back that confidence because having him as a dependable back-up is going to be vital for our long season. I'll even say, if we see the same Tony of old (ok maybe even just last season's form), in some games, I wouldn't be surprised to see Valencia preferred to Darmian in the last 30mins of a game or even more (!).

I have a lot of time for Valencia because he's proper professional and with the right coaching/arm around the shoulder, he's more than good enough to be our Phil Neville, Wes Brown, O'Shea on that touchline.

159~~~
Its not going to be fun listening to everyone moan each time he gets a cameo.

160~~~
I absolutely agree that Valencia should play on a rotation basis, and I can see the reasons why he would be a good defender to put on Montero because of his pace and power. I still think that this won't matter because Montero's movement and ability to use both feet will make pace and power less effective. I'd rather LVG played Valencia against Brugge and saved Darmian for Swansea.

161~~~
I'm no big fan of Valencia but the last page is a perfect example of people seeing what they want to see. Darmian has been no better than Valencia going forward. Valencia is judged ten times more harshly (perhaps rightly) than Darmian because people still remember how good he was at his peak. Take that out of the equation and his performances going forward as Right Back were no worse than Darmian's. Despite his baffling reluctance to take players on, he still did it on a more regular basis than Darmian has done so far and there were some pretty good goals he set up last season doing that (Liverpool and Sunderland come to mind).

162~~~
My problem with Valencia is that he is not very good at defending, or going forward.

The defending part is understandable, he isn't a defender, or particularly switched on in that position.

The going forward part I imagine he is picked up on more because that's what he is supposed to be "good" at, yet he has been absolutely terrible at that as well.

163~~~
It'll be interesting to see who starts on Sunday and how they cope with Montero!

The part romanticist and part pragmatist, says I'll be happy to see Valencia (or even Young) play on the right wing for some games this season. With the consistency of how we're excuting a consistent game plan and style, orthodox players like Young and Valencia can actually play very well/flourish if given the right instructions/confidence boost. Those both offer a combination of big game experience, a certain consistency and raw pace that neither Mata, Januzaj or the youth can offer.

I'd love it if we can involve Perreira, Wilson and Lingard more but at the same time I feel that senior pairing have a lot to offer that we shouldn't discard so easily this season. I hope and I think LVG understands this as well.

164~~~
I would like to see Lindgard given a go on the right actually, with Mata playing centrally.

165~~~
Darmian bas done nothing offensively to make him better than Valencia in that regard. Valencia was average at both ends, Darmian is superb defensively and as average hoping forwards. He's new though and it should getter with time but putting him on a pedestal unnecessarily is weird.

166~~~
Would love to see Tony V mark 1 the one that first thought was to take the man on get to the byeline and put the ball across the box making him unplayable at times in the position Mata finds himself. Unfortunately we got to this position because we now have Tony V mark 2 the one that refuses to take a man on and when he has no choice he blasts the ball of the defenders shins.

167~~~
Valencia used to be one of the best wingers in the league and three years later we're having a debate whether he's any better going forward than a traditional right back and people are confused as to why Valencia gets stick? Let's not also forget that when he came on vs Newcastle they had just decided to retreat and defend the penalty box. Valencia had all the time and space in the world and it was fecking obvious he needed to drive at defenders and drag them out of position and get them moving towards their own goal. That was the rationale for bringing him on. He has the pace and ability to do it. Problem is he's a bottler and will take no responsibility. You  can't defend that. Young would have at least had a crack and taking on his man, and not just pumped aimless balls into the box.

168~~~
bump

169~~~
Poor old turn back. Not getting a look in it seems

170~~~
He'll play when Darmian inevitably gets his 5th yellow card and get suspended.

171~~~
yeah, been dreading that moment.

172~~~
He's 30. I think this is his last season with us.

173~~~
I must have missed the memo about Valencia being good defensively. He's fast and strong, sure, but he doesn't really have defensive instincts, can't tackle well, and has a mistake in him. The difference with Darmian is night and day.

174~~~
he's still good back up option and good servant to the club but if we get rid of him, we should promote Varela to the first team, the guy's good enough but maybe he's too Rafael type of player for Van Gaal but he's not brazilian so he may get a chance in the future we'll see

175~~~
Valencia is a quality player to have in the squad. Don't understand the moaning the guy never lets us down and has a great attitude towards playing for United. Plus I'd rather have him at right wing instead of Mata.

176~~~
He will get games but he no longer is a starter for us. For too long people wanted him to be dropped so they should be satisfied

177~~~
At least you can prepare yourself psychologically.

178~~~
"Supporters" I assume. Works his socks off every match and isn't half as bad as portrayed on here, but that won't stop people heading onboard the bandwagon, sadly.

179~~~
It's not a bandwagon,  it's become painfully obvious he's just not good enough for us anymore. There seems to be a loyalist few who flat out refuse to acknowledge his catalogue of errors when he's played full back, they seem to believe being fast and strong makes you good at defending. Nothing against the bloke, works hard and seems like a genuinely nice man, but he is an absolute liability when he's on the pitch, whatever he had that made him a fantastic winger several years back has long gone.

180~~~
Hopefully Darmian gets his two yellows in the next two games so it's the Ipswich game he's suspended for.

181~~~
I would like him to get a game as right winger with Darmian behind him.

182~~~
There is every chance he'll get those cards too ! I love his attitude, if he can't win fairly then he's prepared to take a card to stop an opponent.

183~~~
yeah, been trying to relax myself over Valencia's videos of 2011/12 season.

184~~~
This except I'd add that I do have a gripe against him in that he's been a complete coward in terms of taking on any responsibility in the last 3 seasons, which is at odds with the character we saw when he came back from a broken leg to be our player of the year.

185~~~
Good player to have in the squad, with the amount of games coming up, I would expect Darmian to be rested on a few occasions.

186~~~
You did see how awful his cameos against Spurs and Newcastle were?

187~~~
Will be needed as Darmian will pick up a lot of yellows over the course of the season.

188~~~
What a lot of rubbish, Valencia is great in possession and there are not many who get the better of him. If you think we can get a better squad player (attitude/cost) than Valencia then who? We have got rid of the deadwood in Anderson Evans Fletcher Cleverley these were the guys not good enough. Valencia is still here and is a valuable member of the squad in my opinion. He'll play more than a few games this season and would be more effective than Mata in the right side of attack that's for sure.

189~~~
He's hardly had any match practice so clearly his match fitness will be poor. As soon as he gets some games under his belt he will be fine.

190~~~
too bad he is not getting games. He improved under van Gaal. Hope we see him in the cup matches.

191~~~
I wouldn't put him in the team now. Decent back-up option I guess, but I never feel safe with him in defense. Going forward he's not the player he once was. Whether it's a confidence issue or not, it doesn't look like he's likely to get that back.

192~~~
In a team that struggles to create the last think you need is a fullback who's full passing capabilites consist of a 5 yard square pass and hitting the first defender in the balls with every single cross.
I see you are one of those who think being big and fast makes a good defender, positionally and tactically he's clueless, he has no idea how to operate with other defenders and seems to have a knack of never being in line with the rest of the back 4. He cannot be relied upon, at all. The worse we've looked defensively this season coincided with Valencias cameo against Newcastle.

Going forwards he seems to have lost all ability he once had of taking players on, no invention in his play whatsoever, it's saddening really when you think back to what he once was. I'd have a half fit Mata over Valencia any day.

193~~~
Do you like watching the ball get kicked into the defenders shins?

194~~~
No but I would rather see that than Mata checking back constantly. How many games do you see our attacks come down the right hand side? Next to none as Mata cuts back or inside every time it's dreadful.

195~~~
Mata has set up 3 goals and scored 1 already this season. I think you're being overly critical.

196~~~
I like Mata but as a right side of a three up top he is the main factor imo why we are struggling to create anything. I'm not in any camp regarding size but I'd like to see attacks from the right hand side. With Mata (who is full of quality) you get next to nothing from him in this position it's a horrible waste and handicaps our team no end.

197~~~
No I like Mata but in this position he's severely hampered and it affects our team. The quicker he is moved the better it's only a matter of time imo before he's either out the team or as a 10.

198~~~
But that doesn't make a lot of sense considering there's been quite a few instances this season when he's been the only one who's been looking too, and has successfully, created opportunities.

199~~~
Why, are you a masochist?

200~~~
I'd understand the sentiment of playing Valencia if he was running at his full back like he used to. But he just hasn't done it consistently for a long time and has provided almost no end product

201~~~
I think he's struggling out there because of the lack of movement in and around him. He isn't going to create a goal himself,  he excels in finding that killer pass and if that pass isn't on he's somewhat blunted.

202~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

203~~~
I don't care what anyone says but I think he's still good enough for us. Though, more of a defensive player than an offensive one strangely.

204~~~
True - but even still he does need to take more chances, as do all our players... unfortunately I think thats more to do with our style/LVG ball then it is the indviduals themselves.

But take the first half yesterday, thanks in large part to having Fellaini up front, I think it was possibly the worst movement we've had all season from our forward players, and that's saying something. There were no runs being made for anyone to make through-balls for... so god knows what we were expected to create. Any chances were obviously going to come through individual excellence (which came in the second half through Young and Martial) or Liverpool defensive errors (them gifting us the ball in dangerous areas in the first half / the penalty) - and so it told by the end of the day.

The thing, is people have attached this "he just turns and pass it 5/10 yards backwards" inside thing to Mata as a staple, despite the fact that EVERYONE does it. Literally, all our forward players are guilty of doing it (if anyone thinks Valencia wouldn't do the same thing - but worse, is thinking way too highly of Antonio Valencia)... and in fact, it was Herrera who was the main culprit of this yesterday, who received the ball numerous times on the turn and could easily have moved the ball into dangerous areas - either through a pass or dribbling - and still went backwards. Depay was also doing it too, the only difference there was that he kept losing the ball.

But yeah, when Ander Herrera is your main culprit for turning backwards, then its clearly from being under instruction...

205~~~
It just goes to show how much better the team is when you play everyone in the correct position.

206~~~
Our best performances under LVG came last season during the Liverpool, Totenham games.

207~~~
I agree that's why he needs to be played centrally rather than right of a three where he is found wanting. I'll stick to my guns I'd rather have Valencia or Young in there than Mata. I'd like to see Mata at 10 but I also like Herrera there.

208~~~
I wouldn't be against this because they are both very orthdox players and could link up/compliment each other well. However, with the way the team is set up, Valencia's lack of game time (let alone build an understanding with Darmian) etc we're not sure whether this will be a realistic opportunity or good idea.

The thing is though, he's a Utd stalwart. Last year we all lamented Young (myself massively) and Valencia for them being in the team and underperforming-to-our-expectations but we absolutely have to keep them and integrate for the long season.

Although a little surprised, I was not against LVG's decision to sub off Depay for Young and it worked. Young and Valencia are capable of changing the flow of the game not through their ability but rather their styles and it shouldn't be underestimated what their professionalism and experience can help when we are deep into the year.

209~~~
Every time he 'smashes it against a defender's shins' he wins us a corner. Crosses aren't always on, so that's often the best option. I don't get the hate this guy receives.

Valencia is almost Solskjaer-esque with his attitude. I love him. It's disappointing that there are United fans who don't.

210~~~
"The best option" - So you think he smashes them in to the defenders on purporse? 

Now this is new...Unbelievable

211~~~
Have you never seen a player kick the ball against the opponent in order to win a throw in, or a goalkick, or a corner? Happens all the time.

212~~~
Couldn't seem to make his mind up whether he wanted to go forwards or backwards the one time he had the ball.

213~~~
How often do we score from corners?

214~~~
He was absolutely terrified of using his left foot.

215~~~
Lingard>>Valencia

216~~~
Can't believe we're back to using Valencia as an attacking option. Deary deary me, what must Lingard, Perraira and Wilson be thinking?

The moment where he couldn't decide what to do, turned back a few times, then just ended up tripping himself over, pretty much sums up his attacking capabilities these days. 

He's woeful.

217~~~
i wasn't able to watch yesterday, but was he actually subbed on to play as a winger/forward/attacking player?

... if the answer is yes, may i already say "surely you jest?"

218~~~
Not going to be too harsh on him, he was thrown into a situation in which he was never going to be successful. Blame LvG for putting him on if anything.

219~~~
He's not a player who can break down compact teams, he should come on or play when we are on the counter attack, or are winning by a goal where he can stretch teams and then you will see his best.

220~~~
He's on at RB. Hope he can show he's a good option there.

221~~~
I'm a big critic of his but he has done well since coming on.

222~~~
He's been great. Darmian has looked tired recently.

223~~~
Was very good when he came on today. Darmian has looked tired these last 2 games so it's nice to have someone to rotate with him.

224~~~
Did well when he came on, but sort of like Romero in goal you sense there's a feck up around the corner waiting.

225~~~
Darmian was poor too against psv so pleased to see Valencia looking pretty good today

He will obviously play again Wednesday and darmian to return next weekend

226~~~
Was good today. Offers width which lets Mata shine more.

227~~~
Valencia+ Mata has always been a good combo...  Nice to know we have good cover in RB when Darmian isn't performing or is fatigued.

228~~~
He was a bit all over the place in the first 5 minutes or so. Seemed like a dog off the lead, just chasing the ball. He settled into the game though, and did well. I'm not a fan of changing the back four during a game unless it's for an injury, and Southampton flew out of the blocks in the 2nd half, straight down our right, so it was difficult for him to feel his way into the game.

Decent performance. Very solid in the tackle, and he does really well when playing out from the back in tight spaces. His technique when the ball is coming to him is very underrated. You could shoot the ball out of a cannon at him and he would control it.

Should definitely play midweek, and give Darmian a well deserved rest.

229~~~
Playing him at RB frees up Darmian to fill in at LB if necessary.

230~~~
Did well after coming on tonight for a struggling Darmian. That's exactly what you want from a squad player, just like Young last week after coming on against Liverpool. Great to see these two continuing to prove their worth to the squad.

231~~~
Yeah fair fecks to him. He was really good when he came on.

232~~~
I told you he was good.

233~~~
If Tony will be constantly building the form we may have to send Darmian to the left side perhaps.

Next weeks will be extremely interesting how we'll set our team deeper into season.

234~~~
Really liked his performance today. One of his harshest critics so I guess I have made Valencia's day. Celebrate buddy.

235~~~
Very pleased with his performance, not least because it gives Mata more freedom to drift. After a few examples of Mata showing danger when drifting into the middle during the first half, I'd imagine LvG made the substitution specifically with this in mind.

236~~~
I said it before, if we're going to play someone like Mata on the right, who likes to drift into the middle, we need an attacking right back, and Valencia is much more suited to that role than Darmian, although Darmian is superb defensively.

Think when we're playing against teams that are going to sit behind the ball, we should play Valencia. He's gives a much better outlet than Darmian.

237~~~
Did very well. Nothing silly.

238~~~
Was solid when he came on, nothing spectacular but that's what we needed

239~~~
Beast-Mode

240~~~
Agree.

241~~~
Yep, hopefully he gets some confidence from that and he'll play Wednesday.

242~~~
Worked hard when he came on, he creates more space for Mata even if he doesn't actually offer a threat in the actual attack.

243~~~
Was good I thought. Might push Darmian a bit who's gone off the boil a bit

244~~~
I don't like seeing Valencia playing for us at all but even I had to admit that he did a good job in the second half. Tadic was contained well by him.

245~~~
Same here, I thought he did well today against a very tough opponent.

246~~~
He certainly transforms Mata, and they at least provide some sort of attack on the right side. They´ve always seemed to have a good understanding. Looked very confident as well. The vote of confidence from Van Gaal to bring him on one time for the second half must´ve given him a shot in the arm. Wouldn´t say he should he be above Darmian yet, but a couple more dire performances from the Italian could change that.

Great squad player to have.

247~~~
Thought he was superb when he came on this time, unlike previous appearances. Have said time and time again, he has all the tools to be the best full back in the world. He won't ever be, or come close due to the nature of the beast but his raw attributes are superb.

Anyway, that version of Valencia could quite happily slot back into right back for Darmian to switch over to left back as an option too. In fact, that version of Valencia may even give Darmian something to think about after all.

248~~~
A very good cameo from him.

249~~~
1st time he was playing at RB and I couldn't see a blatant mistake...well done. Competition seems to be helping him.

250~~~
I can see him starting against Ipswich and Sunderland.

251~~~
Yeah, I thought he was really good today. Never been his biggest fan at right back, but if he can show all he qualities in the cameos he has this season he'll still be a asset to the squad.

252~~~
Straight in for Darmian, didn't put a foot wrong. Exactly what you want from players like Valencia. Pleased to see him do well and not be thrown under the bus by fans.

253~~~

254~~~
been a serial critic of valencia recently but have to admit he did well today.

255~~~
He should. I think Darmian needs some rest...

256~~~
I think it's quite possible that Darmian will switch to LB and Valencia will play RB in the tough games because neither Rojo nor Blind particularly impressed there. We do know that against a certain opponent Blind will be ok at LB or CB but against Mane and Pelle, without the protection of a solid LB, he was bound to struggle. Whilst Valencia does have his moments at RB he is one guy who won't let you down so even at his worst, which he was far from in his cameo, he is still a better evil than what Rojo has shown at LB imo.

257~~~
'5 point lead' <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Why did you have to post that?

258~~~
Played well today got down the right hand side and could have had a couple of assists, also had a good shot saves in what was a good all round display.

259~~~
Some powerful surging runs, it's just a shame that he seems to have no cutting edge in the final 3rd.

260~~~
Fantastic match tonight. Impeccable defense, great going forward and an understanding with Mata that made for some great attacking football at times. What a breath of fresh air.

261~~~
Really? A player like Valencia playing for a club like us against Championship Ipswich should really be doing much more than he did tonight. Anyone can leg it into the box and fall over their own feet. How standards have slipped. Like Valencia himself.

262~~~
The one time he fell over his feet, which admittedly was pretty bad, was after a beautiful hook up with Mata. Basically his only flaw tonight, and of course it has to be highlighted. Otherwise he was great tonight. Give the guy some credit. Who cares if it was Ipswich.

263~~~
His pace is frightening. When he's at full speed, defenders are fecked. I just wish his final ball was a little better, like it was in his first season for us. Had it on a plate a dozen of times for Rooney that season. Still, he gets into those positions so will no doubt create chances.

Very good option to have our Tony.

264~~~
My god, it doesnt take much to impress some of you does it.



What the hell?

265~~~
I thought he was good but just was a tiny bit off in the final third. If a few things had come off he might have got one or two assists.

266~~~
¿Eso que, Antonio? ¿Estas loco?

267~~~
He does a lot more than Darmian going forward.. even without the final ball. 
Him getting forward creates space for Mata/whoever is on there.

He is great.. Darmian is better defensively. Val is a fantastic option to have though. And at the moment, with the squad and injuries we have, I'm glad we have him.

268~~~
Looks back to being a very good second choice, which is great.

Still nowhere near threatening Darmian for me though, who apart from one so-so performance in his most recent game has been near flawless.

Some players get swelling in their feet and ankles sometimes, and I've heard keeping your boots on until you've had your ice bath can limit that. Could be bullshit, but a mate of mine who plays county hockey does it.

269~~~
He literally can't attack anymore. I mean seriously, he just falls over or wins a throw in. Solid in defence though.

How on earth did he used to be a winger? Its like a different player.

270~~~
I wouldn't say he does more going forward, just that he gets forward more, which in turn leaves more room for mata and is an extra passing option.

Balls out madman just bombing up the touchline all game. Fair play to him.

272~~~
Didn't think he had a good game yesterday, considering the standard of opposition. Had a few chances to break and messed most of them up. Darmian would have been more effective. The only thing he does well is when he cuts inside and offers a little more presence on the ball that creates space for others. But Mata is good at doing that anyway.

273~~~
It's a warning to opposition defenders...

274~~~
#legsorhotdogs

275~~~
Opposition defenders have nothing to worry about when he 'bombs' up the pitch as he won't do anything worthwhile with the ball.

Let a man stand before him and he'll either deliver a shit cross or pass sideways or back. If noone stands before him he will run into trouble when he tries to surge into the box from the right and lose it because he has no left foot to shoot, can't cross for shit and can't maintain the ball in a crowded area.

I know better now than to get excited when he has all the space in front of him and runs and runs and runs... he will either feck up the pass, trickle the ball back when he inexplicably stops and waits for the defender to assume his position or fall over like a donkey.

276~~~
He really has a great understanding with Mata. Just which he could actually carve up some chances with them.

Caf really seems to underrate him defensively.

277~~~
I think it's pretty simple.  Darmian plays against top teams in away matches when we're expecting to defend for long periods.  He's more of a natural defender and can more likely last the 90 minutes without a mistake.

Valencia plays when we're attacking or playing weaker sides.  His speed is a better protection against an opponents counterattack, and in these games we generally defend higher up the pitch, so any mistakes due to not being a natural defender are less costly.

278~~~
Just like away to PSV and Southampton, right? I don´t think it´s pretty simple at all.

279~~~
Maybe its just me but seems sometimes he does not know to run any other way then parallel with sideline,think Mata slipped a ball 2 times between LB and CB and he couldnt reach it due him not be being able to change path of run.

280~~~
Are you serious?

281~~~
Yes. He gave the ball away inside our own half quite a few times, then had the chance to cross it first time when Mata played him in down the right but dithered and ended up placing a cross directly onto the head of an Ipswich defender. He slipped on that 3 on 3 break in the second half, and gave away fouls whenever he tried to beat his man. The only things he did well were that half decent cross to Fellaini and the simple pass to Pereira for his shot. Darmian would have done at least that much, if not more. 

Valencia has the talent to deliver more in attack on the right than Darmian, but he didn't show it against Ipswich.

282~~~
No difference between him and Darmian atm, both have been very good.

283~~~
He's like the footballing equivalent of orgasm denial, he surges forward with those fast powerful runs and then stalls when the box comes into view.

284~~~
Good game so far by Tony V.

285~~~
I still don't know how he fecked up that first one. He just seems to love ruining all his good work.

286~~~
His crossing is atrocious, it's not even funny anymore.

287~~~
Just a standard Valencia performance.

288~~~
I thought he had a good game. Created tons of space for Mata. He'd be a really good player if his crosses were better.

289~~~
Had a fine game

And darmian did well on the left too

290~~~
If he could cross a ball he'd be great. Gets so much space.

291~~~
Thought him and Darmian were as good as each other tbh. Both very good

292~~~
Didn't he set Anthony Martial up today with one of his crosses?...

293~~~
So are most full backs crossing, yet he seems to get the berating for it. hmmm..

294~~~
If he had any quality on his delivery he'd be a weapon, instead his best attribute is making space for Mata.

295~~~
He is a Manchester United player, that's why. And his crossing is even worse.

296~~~
Yeah. Has food movement and excellent pace which puts him I'm such great positions. Too bad his crossing is shite.

297~~~
Except Valencia is actually a winger playing as a fullback. Oh and just because others are poor at it doesn't mean it should be excused.

298~~~
Definitely, I just don't understand it. He doesn't take set pieces, he doesn't do tricks, doesn't have the best range of passing etc and his crossing is still so erratic. What does he work on from a technical point of view in training? 

As you say he could be such a good outlet, particularly in this team where we have so much of the ball he can push up high but he needs to get his crossing sorted.

299~~~
So why isn't Darmian getting any stick when he is a worse attacker than Valencia?

300~~~
Hope we stick with this setup, Valencia on the right and Darmian on the left, while Shaw is out. With Mata cutting inside so much, we need someone to maintain the width on the right and Valencia is more eager to get forward and has more to offer offensively than Darmian.

I generally didn't think he deserved to be dropped after a very solid last season and I still think he looks just as good as Darmian (who I've been happy with, mind you).

301~~~
I don't know, I think his crossing is not good enough too. But I have seen plenty of criticism towards Darmian regarding his crossing though. Besides that, Darmian is a much better defender than Valencia.

302~~~
Valencia is a right back now, he's changed and he is better defensively. But he can still get forward and take his man on, his only problem is the final ball. Like I said Valencia will predominantly play as a right back now, you won't judge BFS as a winger anymore.

303~~~
I can't believe people keep questioning Valencia. I'm sure if van gaal was asked about Valencia's performance he would be thrilled. He puts in so much work and clearly Mata has a better understanding with him than with Darmian (who BTW seems hesitant to attack when played as a RB). Yes Valencia lacks some quality in the final third but he's an absolute beast in defense and compliments Mata well. we are lucky to have him.

304~~~
No, he is a full back now. I know, but you all berate him as if all the other top full backs are such amazing crossers of the ball when they clearly are not.

305~~~
Completely incomparable. Valencia was a winger up until he was 28 years old. Bastian also plays in midfield, midfielders don't do the same stuff wingers do. Full-backs do. It's nonsense to suggest his poor crossing should be excuses because he's a full back now.

306~~~
Didn't see anything different (defending wise) from them today. Last week Valencia was brought on as Darmian wasn't doing a good enough job and LVG said himself that Valencia done the job that Darmian hadn't. I'm not saying Valencia is better than Darmian, I'm saying that it's much closer than people think.

307~~~
He's technically a fullback, yes, but he was a winger for his entire career so you would expect his crossing would be at a higher standard. Instead it's very poor.

Us berating his crossing is completely irrelevant to whether other full backs are good crossers or not, I haven't seen anyone in here say "his crossing is shitter than other fullbacks", they've just said "his crossing is shit".

308~~~
250th league appearance, just the 2nd South American to do so (Solano did it too).

Crossing is absolute pants but his all round game is good. He makes very nice runs and defends very well.

309~~~
It doesn't matter when they adapted, the fact is they both changed position and both have different duties now. It's much harder to be composed and pull of a cross now that Valencia has to get up and down the field on a regular basis and do a job both attacking and defending. Also I'm not saying his crossing isn't good, but it's not bad either, the main point I'm trying to make is a full back shouldn't be the main attacking point to any team and so his crossing abilities shouldn't be the ones we mainly judge him on when playing right back.

310~~~
And 2-3 matches earlier when Valencia was subbed on for Darmian who played very well suddenly the opposing team became very threatening on their left flank because Valencia's defending was bad. Overall Darmian has showed much more than Valencia. And Darmian is criticised too for his offensive displays.

311~~~
Yeah he is, but nowhere near as often as Valencia.

And that game he was subbed on was his first game after a very important operation.

312~~~
Yeah, but he has been playing much better as a full back than he has as a winger for a long time now. If he is a full back now, then we hold him to the standards of his position and not was he was in the past.

313~~~
2-3 matches earlier? It was the first game of the fecking season that happened. I knew someone was going to bring that up.

314~~~
He was a really good outlet today, to be fair. The thing with Valencia is that you get the same strengths and the same weaknesses week after week, which makes him all the more frustrating.

Defended well, however.

315~~~
No, incorrect, Valencia still has the same duty as before, crossing the ball. He has other duties that differ as a full back to a winger, namely defensive ones, but crossing the ball is still a very important facet of his game, just as it is for most fullbacks in the modern game. If it wasn't his duty, he wouldn't be attempting loads of them in every game, it's not like he's doing it of his own will, or something. He's clearly instructed to get forward, and cross the ball. His crossing is poor, and that's why he's getting slated for it. If it was not his duty and he wasn't putting crosses in, then I'm sure nobody would care. 

What you're basically saying is that because he's a fullback and not a winger now, crossing is almost irrelevant, which makes no sense, because he put more crosses in than any other player today and was used as the focal point of our crosses for the majority of the game. 

The bolded part is just insane logic, though, how exactly does him being in defensive positions more have a profound effect on his ability to cross the football. Is it that when he has the ball at his feet, ready to put a cross in, he suddenly thinks "oh shit, erm, better not feck this up, what if it goes wrong and I have to run all the way back to chase the defender, oh noes, panic, ahh, hit the ankles, hit the ankles!!"

316~~~
Ok, I'll hold him to the standards of that position.

He's playing at full back for one of the world's biggest clubs and his crossing is not remotely close to the standards we should expect from one. Likewise for Darmian, actually.

There, happy?

317~~~
Besides Valencia is a squad player. He is our back up right back. Most top club's back up players to a certain position, aren't that spectacular, but they rise to the occasion when they are needed.

Did Valencia do that these past couple of games he has received heavier minutes? Damn straight he has;in addition, his chemistry with Mata has further increased the productivity and creativity of our team;thus, us becoming a more dangerous team going forward. Hop off his dick and appreciate that he has been doing a solid job for us.

318~~~
When you are tired, do you perform worse? I think so.

And I didn't say crossing wasn't important I said we should judge him on more important thing as well as crossing. On this forum people mainly judge him on crossing and getting forward completely neglecting the fact that he is getting forward when others aren't.

319~~~
Have you played 11 a side? Wingers probably run as much, if not more than fullbacks do, you know. And they sprint more, too. Why do you think most top clubs rotate wingers if they can but usually keep their full backs playing in every match?

320~~~
Who are we talking about?

321~~~
He actually put in a very nice cross to Martial today. Not that anyone would remember, or even less so, credit him.

322~~~
This season, Darmian, Rooney, and Memphis have all stepped away from attacking relaying on someone else to do it. They all attacked better this game but their form throughout the season hasn't been the same as today. Thus at least Valencia is taking a chance and taking people on, which he did a lot today. Most of his crosses weren't good but he did put in a few of good ones, especially the one where Martial probably should have scored.

323~~~
Didn't Valencia give  Martial his best chance at goal with his "shitty crossing"

324~~~
Rooney plays through the middle, I fail to see how that's relevant, and I certainly don't think he's shied away from getting forward. Memphis and Darmian get forward a lot, so again, not sure what you're watching here.

325~~~
Yeah, it was a very good cross. Shame about the other <insert big number here>.

326~~~
Why doesn't he try lifting his crosses a little more rather than just smashing all of them. Variety is the spice of life so they say.

327~~~
Darmian getting forward a lot? You´re joking aren´t you. He is dire offensively. Valencia also plays very well with Mata. On that alone I would choose Tony over Mateo. But with Shaw out, I´m delighted to have Darmian on the left.

328~~~
No? Darmian does get forward a lot. As I said above, his crossing as equally as disappointing as Valencia's when he gets into those positions though.

329~~~
He only messed up  one or two other crosses today.

330~~~
They have got forward yeah, but no where near as often as Valencia got forward today, he put in a great shift in.

And that brings me to another point, people moaning about Valencia's quality are again completely neglecting the fact that most of our crosses or penetrative passes haven't come off and that Valencia isn't the only one to turnback and play a back pass. He get's far too much stick on here.

331~~~
I can barely even remember a Darmian cross. Does it ever happen?

332~~~
Frustrating performance, kept getting the ball in good areas and then messing it up. How he contrived to dribble the ball over the line when clear behind their defence I'll never know. Kept mis-controlling it when Rooney pinged him those diagonal through balls too. Darmian was better attacking-wise than him today.

333~~~
Last season when he became more established at right back. He lifted his crosses a lot more, he even started putting in a few decent crosses with the outside of his right foot.

334~~~
His first touch was brilliant (as it always it) today. I didn't see him miss control anything today (apart from the one where he let the ball roll across the line).

335~~~
I remember when he first came here and started working those drilled crosses I to his game, thought it was brilliant. But back then, he had the speed to get ahead of the defender first. 

Still I think he remains solid as a backup option and that's more than most teams can say. Much prefer him there to the days of Jones and Smalling.

336~~~
Darmian, until the end of the game, hardly ever got forward with the ball. At least Valencia actually made those forward runs that stretched the play and opened up the defense for our attackers.

337~~~
That's cause they're easily forgettable.
Nah, you're making things up to suit your argument. Look back at the Darmian thread, everyone was loving how much he bombs up and down the pitch for us.

I don't disagree with the second part, our crossing, in general has not been good enough, and Valencia is not the only one to blame for that. However, he had far more of the ball in those sort of areas today than anyone else and he didn't do enough with it (bar the cross to Martial), and that's why he's getting stick.

Memphis is getting plenty of stick too, by the way, and Rooney has gotten far more stick than any other player in our team this season, so it's not like it's some vendetta against Valencia like you're trying to make it out to be. If players don't do well enough, they get stick for it, simple as that.

338~~~
Who was out main attacking threat today? Who was the guy that we were constantly playing the ball too?

339~~~
He did get forward a few times in the first half, didn't he have a good run at the start of the game? But the difference is Darmian today and bar a few of his previous games has been very good defensively although lacking somewhat in a attack. Valencia is questionable defensively, often saving himself due to his physical attributes giving him a good ability to recover, his saving grace should be his attacking outlet and unfortunately it isn't. 

If Depay is going to keep his spot then I'd see how Young can do at rb if Darmain stays left. With Shaw out we need one of the fullbacks providing a real threat and as Valencia showed in a lot of games we will have space to exploit there. We need to make the most of it.

340~~~
That cross to Martial was the only cross that actually led to something since Mata's cross at the beginning of the Southampton game that was mistimed by Depay...

341~~~
Well that was Rooney who loves that pass from the left side to the right, no one else was really playing it from memory and in most cases it came to nothing if you're suggesting Valencia was our main threat. We did show though that there's a lot of space out wide though and we need to be utilising it better. Valencia got in to good positions, no one can deny that but he as typical failed to do anything with it more often than not.

342~~~
Very harsh, the first one he could never have been realistically expected to keep in and the second one was a difficult one too. Overall he wasn't great today - didn't really need to be I suppose seeing as Sunderland were hardly a threat. Going forward his pace and energy will always be an asset, and lack of guile is always pretty evident. 

For the record, Darmian skipped past a couple of tackles and put a good ball in early on and got into a good position midway through the first half with some good control and then put the cross into the stands. More forgivable given that he was using his weaker foot.

343~~~
I can't be doing with him. Great athlete, a real trier who plays for the badge, but feck me he has a severely limited skillset.

344~~~
It's a close call between three players, Valencia certainly isn't one of them. Unless your idea of being threatening is not being threatening?
I'm confused as to how that could possibly support your argument? Although, I don't even know what your argument is supposed to be now. I think it started as him not being judged on his crossing at all, but then it changed to him needing to be judged less harshly because he apparently gets more tired these days, but then it changed to, well, forget his crossing, look how much of the ball he had! Then it went from no longer talking about him full-back wise and trying to compare him to our attacking players, despite your initial argument being that he's a full back now, not an attacker, so shouldn't be judged as an attacker. Now, um, now I assume you're going to try tell me that because we gave him the ball loads, he was our most threatening player, or something?

345~~~
My argument is me responding to your many criticisms of him and mentioning this that he is good at, which he is not getting credit for.

Who were the three players you mentioned?

346~~~
Your argument is going in weird tangents, and not really making any sense. I also don't think you've listed one thing he's really good at yet, apart from maybe ... getting into those wide positions? Hurray, he can get into them, now if only he could do something with the football when he is in them.

Martial, Mata and (to a lesser extent) Rooney were our three best attackers today, all of whom were far more threatening than Valencia.

Really, if you actually hold the opinion that he was our more threatening player today then you must have some ridiculous bias to him, because it's daft, and it's probably not worth continuing this.

347~~~
He's good at many things, He can get up and down the field quickly and effectively, he can defend, if he is caught out of position he has the pace to get back, he is strong, his link up play is brilliant among many more attributes that he brings to the team.

Maybe I used the wrong word, what I meant was he was clearly the main part of the game plan today. Our game plan was clearly to get it out wide to Valencia so he could take the player on and get the cross in. Why would this be our game plan if van Gaal didn't think he was good enough to do this effectively?

348~~~
How he's lasted this long at a top club is a mystery. He's shite as a winger and below average at RB.

349~~~
But I haven't criticized any of those things, that's why this is so strange. I criticized his crossing, only his crossing, and you've turned it into a full scale, weird defense of his entire game, even though I never said anything about the rest of his game.

I'd say Rooney's game plan was to get it wide to Valencia, not sure about everyone else.

350~~~
You said I didn't list any good qualities to his game, so I did, you didn't specify if it had to be about today's game or in general.

351~~~
Because you said this

352~~~
Yes and I didn't specify if it was about today's game or in general. And actually he did perform well in all the places I said today. He defended brilliantly, I don't remember then getting a chance down the right, his link up play with Mata was superb (the first attack Mata played a brilliant ball for the run of Valencia. Again he showed his pace and Strength with his few dribbles that he attempted and completed. Darmian and Valencia both played well today and I hope they are our full backs for the season. 

Who would you have replacing Shaw?

353~~~
I have literally never had a single discussion about Valencia with you prior to today's game, there is no "in general" when you say you're responding to "many criticisms". I had one (today), his crossing. I explained why he should be judged on it when you and another said he should not, you decided to bring all this other nonsense into it after that, because I assume you couldn't keep that argument going and thought that you'd be able to keep going if you veered off into other, unrelated aspects.

354~~~
Mate you said I didn't mention anything he is good at, so I did and now you are moaning at me because I did so? What did you want me to say when you said I didn't mention anything he was good at?

355~~~
The obvious response to that was "Oh yeah ... I didn't, I'll retract that statement then. Cya!"

356~~~
Well I have a different opinion than you.

357~~~
Yeah, I think Rooney could have done better with those balls as well. It seemed to me a little bit that making that kind of pass was the move Wayne felt most confident doing, so he was going to do it whether it was the right decision or not. Still would have liked to see more from Valencia given the standard of opposition (same criticism I had with his play against Ipswich). Compared to Young, he doesn't look like someone determined to win his place back in the team.

358~~~
He should be a rugby player.

359~~~
He can't cross to save his life.

360~~~
Our coaching staff should just stick cardboard cut-outs of opposition players onto our own players. He'd be upping his accuracy in no time.

361~~~
I really don't understand how his crossing has got so bad? Surely they work on it in training? How can he not do anything but just smash it as defenders legs? Its honestly pathetic.

He gets into so many fantastic positions with clever runs, then produces nothing. Every single time.

If he could still cross, he'd be great.

362~~~
Including the time where he put it on a plate for Martial...

363~~~
I thought he was fine today. His crossing wasn't great as usual but he pushes the fullbacks back when he drives forward taking their winger with him.

364~~~
Okay, nearly every single time. 

Its so annoying because he could be such an asset if he could still cross like he did back when we first signed him. I'm genuinely at a loss to understand whats happened.

365~~~
I think people are misguided by the fact that he puts in a lot of bad crosses then don't see the good crosses (which admittedly are less in number than the bad crosses but they still exist).

366~~~
Former winger..and first choice RB for United last season, and it appears that for at least the next 6 months, first choice again.

367~~~
He should be putting in a lot more better crosses, considering the amount of fantastic positions he gets himself in. 

If you put the 2010 version in those positions, he'd be racking up the assists.

368~~~
That was "putting it on a plate"? I agree that sometimes his criticism goes overboard but the other side of the spectrum sees posters post this exaggeration. That was a half decent cross but it was perhaps the only one he hit properly the whole match which found our player so people are giddy about its quality. 

Putting on a plate is what Marcelo's cross was for Ronaldo later today when RM played against Malaga. Still don't know how Ronnie skied that.

369~~~
Was a free header in the just outside the six yard box, you would back Martial (especially on his current form) to score that.

370~~~
Would have liked to see Valencia on the left with Darmian in his preferred position to see how it would effect that statement.

371~~~
It was slightly higher and didn't have too much pace on it. Kind of looped in. Just because Martial is in great form does not mean it was a great cross.

372~~~
It was still a good cross. So was the one that got to Rooney.

People act as if he's supposed to create an open scoring chance with his cross everytime - how often do other fullbacks do that in the epl?

373~~~
The worst part was when right at the start he was running with the ball and it took him so long to pick out a destination to cross the ball to that he ran out of bounds with it. He does fairly well until the final moments but somehow cocks it up every time with a horrible cross or some other face palm worthy moment.

374~~~
Thought he was quite good today. A lot of drive going forward. Arguably better than Darmian, offensively.

375~~~
Darmian can play both positions. Have you forgotten that he was also a left back for Torino before he got here?

376~~~
Does not mean that his preferred position is at LB. Young can also play LB, so will you judge him if he played there to accomodate someone else.

377~~~
It was a decent cross and I admitted that but the number of horrible ones he puts in when in great positions is actually incomparable.

378~~~
A decent performance. I am glad we have a squad player like TonyV which is always available when needed. He is going to be massively important till we get Shaw back.

379~~~
When he was at his best, there used to be more variety with his crossing. He wasn't just smashing the ball low and hard but he was also trying to aim and curl it towards a dangerous zone or a player. That's what annoys me the most, it's like he doesn't try to aim anymore.

380~~~
I thought some of his play was a bit sloppy yesterday, I'd prefer to see Darmian play at right back but because of all the injuries I understand why van Gaal had to do that.

381~~~
Seems to have a great understanding with Mata, and I have no qualms about him playing at RB for the majority of the season..needs to work on his crossing though, but very reliable otherwise.

382~~~
This is my sentiment.

383~~~
He played well, got forward well, overlapped and created a lot of space for Mata. 

He's good getting forward, but his crossing has actually got to the point of making me laugh now.

384~~~
Played really well IMO. Going forward he is a lot better then Darmian, though going forward with his runs he's probably one of the best right backs around (mainly because he was a winger but yeah). His final ball is bad unfortunately, but he's always been such a useful player because of how he can run with the ball and keep it under pressure and always drive it forward. 

Since Shaw is out, I think Darmian and Valencia will both be first choice left back and right back, when fit. Makes us more balanced and helps Mata a lot having Valencia's physicality and runs down the right compared to if we put Blind at left back or Rojo there. This way we keep the pace and power and energy that we would have lost in Shaw otherwise.

385~~~
If only he could cross! Honestly If I was LVG(or captain) id demand that he puts in extra hours after training to improve his final ball. Its a disgrace to be so bad at crossing the ball when you play for a top team like United.

386~~~
This. 
His decision making is terrible, but may be inflicted by his complete incompetence when it comes to crossing a ball. The longer he has the ball at the feet, the quicker he runs out of ideas. 
Yes, he's a dedicated, hard working, consummate professional... but that alone should be base level requirement for a professional footballer. Man Utd players need to be better, Valencia needs to be better.

387~~~
It was a fine cross but it wasn't great. Rooney's cross that Memphis just missed was better imo. It's not the technique of the crosses per se that frustrate me, it's the whole lead up to them. He'll get clear behind their defence and then instead of fizzing it in first time, or playing a diagonal or bending cross, or playing a clever disguised pass back into the centre of the box, he'll wait for the defence to regroup and then smash a straight one in. Almost every time. He just doesn't have much of an attacking brain.

388~~~
Just a quick reminder that he's no where near Man United quality

389~~~
That was woeful. No need to be so deep Antonio you plank

390~~~
He can't defend apart from being strong and fast. His positioning is ridiculous.

391~~~
Looked like he wasn't the only one playing him onside in fairness.

392~~~
He's easy fodder though. If Tony is on the pitch he will get blamed.

393~~~
That goal was not his fault. He has to stay alert for the guy lurking behind him, which he is. Who tries to spring an offside trap in their box anyway.

394~~~
Because it's usually his fault.

395~~~
And if it isn't, he will still get blamed.

396~~~
There's a big difference between being half a yard out of line and being 3 yards out of line with the rest of your defense. His positioning is terrible and always has been.

397~~~
It seems strange that LVG has gone to the trouble of playing Blind at CB because he wants someone who can pass etc yet he keeps playing Valencia who is incapable of passing/crossing the ball in any meaningful way.

398~~~
It was awful defending all round

399~~~
Offside is offside, three yards or two inches. Awful positioning though. Too focused on his man.

400~~~
His passing is very good. His crossing not so much.

401~~~
It's almost like he isn't a fullback.

402~~~
The goal goes right through Darmian´s area, who is caught ball watching, and somehow its Valencia´s fault. Brilliant.

403~~~
He's just a stupid player that runs about a lot, he has no idea how to play RB.

404~~~
The remaining three players in the backline who are actually defenders!

405~~~
Every game he plays, he has at least one massive brainfart moment which costs the team.

406~~~
Never a full back. Never.

407~~~
He has absolutely no positional or tactical awareness. 

Horrible horrible defender.

408~~~
Yes it is Valencia's fault for being three yards beyond the line maintained by the other three defenders.

409~~~
Darmian had also played him onside as well.

410~~~
He's sparing Darmian from criticism.

411~~~
Is there anyone defending Darmian on that case? It is also his fault. But Valencia is so far beyond the line maintained that it is simply ridiculous.

412~~~
Why is everyone making out like he was the only one at fault? 

If he'd moved up to the half way line the goal would still have happened ffs.

413~~~
This thread is absolutely ridiculous. He was the least at fault for the goal. Bunch of sheep.

414~~~
Main issue for the goal was Schneiderlin who let his man get passed him way too easily.

415~~~
Yet Darmian has been directly at fault for three goals already, and had to be yanked off at half in one match, yet somehow everyone has his balls in their mouth. Would say he´s as as fault as Valencia seeing as he had played him onside as well

416~~~
Made the highest number of tackles and interceptions. 3 each.

417~~~
Valencia was ball watching as well.. But Darmian at fault as well.
Van Gaal will have a field day with the defense for that I'm sure

We still look very likely to concede on the counter. Need to sort the defense out

418~~~
He was Darmian´s man! Ball watcher.

419~~~
He isn't a winger any more these days so I guess he's just a man without a purpose. Still, this goal was a clusterfeck all around, the other three were practically all holding hands. Darmian was probably most at fault, he's gone off the boil a little in the last few weeks.

420~~~
Darmian is playing as a LB to help get Valencia in the team who is absolutely worthless in any other position apart from RB. Yet Darmian is to be blamed for the brainfart positioning of Valencia who stands so farr off his player that the crosses come in regardless from his wing.

421~~~
Well he is now and not very good at it.

422~~~
Clearly LVG has Darmian's balls in his mouth as well?

423~~~
His absolute best is just about passable as an impression of a United full back. 

Which sums up why he shouldn't still be here.

424~~~
But Valencia was fine in breaking the line to be the last defender 3 yards behind everyone!

425~~~
Valencia gets the boot

426~~~
Darmian is at left back because we have nobody else to play there.

427~~~
I'd say Blind getting too attracted to the ball. Valencia was in no mans land, but in fairness he would have been onside even if Tony was in a good position.

428~~~
FWIW - my view,

Watching their goal back...

Schmidfield were poor and let the defence get over run.
Blind followed a trail like James Woods with sweets on Family Guy.
Smalling was at least 5 yards out of position.
Darmian was lost.
And poor old Tony V was like a man you see on the street wearing an advertising board pointing out the nearest restaurant chain. Except his sign said "go this way for a free shot" with an arrow pointing to our penalty spot.

Absolutely nobody can come out of that with any credit. All are to blame. All made mistakes. All lost each other and all entered David Luiz mode.

429~~~
Very poor, both defensively and in possession. Think we need to have a proper right-back as Darmian's backup.

430~~~
Agreed. Collectively very messy.

431~~~
Because he can play there ans Valencia cannot. He was doing brilliantly at RB and yet we had to move him to accommodate Valencia, not because Valencia is brilliant but because he cannot play anywhere else to the standard required.

432~~~
Well Darmian has had 2 games at left back and he has been good (as he has played there before for Torino and Italy). I don't see why your moaning.

433~~~
But he's not playing there to get Valencia in the team. Brilliantly is an overstatement. He'd been poor before he was dropped after a good start. He was also just as at fault as Valencia for the goal tonight.

434~~~
Not moaning. Just pointing out that Darmian has been better than Valencia despite not being in his preferred position.

435~~~
And Valencia is in his natural position? I think it's much harder to go from winger to full back than right back to left back.

436~~~
He had one poor game when he was subbed off at HT if I recollect correctly. Also not denying that today's goal was partly his mistake as well but seeing Valencia so far out of sync with the rest of the backline is painful and something which has been evident for a long time.

437~~~
Turns out he's not a right back.

438~~~
Or a right winger anymore. He's just not very good really.

439~~~
Valencia is not playing as a winger anymore because he has been crap there for far too long. The only other position he does decently in is RB. 

Darmian is moved to LB, despite him being excellent at RB, to cover for Shaw and to enable his backup to play in the RB position since Valencia is pretty useless elsewhere.

440~~~
ITV analysis of Wolfsburg's goal the only defensive player they didn't mention (as to who was at fault) was Valencia. Not saying it wasn't PARTLY his fault, but no way is it all his fault, Valencia is far too often used as a scapegoat.

441~~~
How he's getting any blame for the goal is beyond me. In order of feck up: Darmian > Schneiderlin > Blind > Smalling > Valencia. Darmian should have been in his position. Schneiderlin shouldn't have made a half ass effort if he's also all the way out of position and Blind shouldn't have let him past him after Schneiderlin's fail. Smalling shouldn't have been ball watching through all of this circus and Valencia was the only one marking the correct player..

442~~~
I'm guessing he wasn't fully fit, seemed to have trouble staying on his feet at times, slipping a lot.

443~~~
He is a bit shit, to be fair.

444~~~
No he's not.

445~~~
Costly positioning errors are part and parcel of playing him in defence. He's got handy attributes and does a decent job, but every now and again his positioning costs us in a way that you rarely see with proper defenders. Not his fault, he's asked to do a job there... but when it's time to assign blame, you can't give him a pass for that.

I really don't want to see him there anymore. I'd much rather Jones got stuck in there, or that Rojo gets stuck on left back duty, and Darmian back on his right back side.

446~~~
He quite often is. I don't think he's an awful right-back, as such, but he's still not particularly great defensively a lot of the time. He'll bomb forward a lot, but it's fairly meaningless when his crossing's often dreadful. For the goal, I don't think he was overly at fault, as such, but his positioning's off. Perhaps you could argue it's because he's not a natural right-back...but then I don't think anyone wants to see him out on the wings either.

447~~~

448~~~
He played the goal scorer on side, Blind was just as much at fault though. He was rubbish tonight, I reckon he was taken off for tactical reasons because we've seen van Gaal do this often with underperforming players.

449~~~
You stand 5 yards behind the rest of the defense it's your fault, there's just no defending that.

450~~~
Valencia clearly fecked up for the goal. Although he wasn't the only one he was still culpable. Just a bad game all round for him tonight. Absolutely the right call to hook him at halftime.

451~~~
It's crazy how we sold off most of the squad but Valencia survived the cull.

452~~~
How the hell can you blame him for the goal?!?  He marked his man(Dost) correctly and fully expected the left side get the ball back from
Caligiuri. Watch the goal again starting from the soft play from Scheiderlin in the middle of the park..

453~~~
Disgrace of a footballer.

Won't survive next summer.

454~~~
He was as much at fault as the rest of the back 4. Might be news to you but standing 5 yards behind the line playing everyone onside is atrocious defending.

455~~~
The Wolfsburg player cant stand in acres of space unmarked if Valencia pushes up.  

He wasn't the only one to cock up, but his was biggest.

456~~~
No he wasn't <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. If Valencia had pushed up Darmian would have still played them offside. Their attacker shouldn't have got past Schneiderlin and Blind when they had him in the corner, and if your blaming defenders positions Smalling came rushing out for no reason.

457~~~
Yep <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's amazing how some people dont understand how the offside trap works.

458~~~
Him and Rooney are the main left overs of dead wood that need to be chopped down next season summer.

459~~~
He doesn't have to be at fault for that goal to be criticised for his positioning which is terrible, that happens to him all the time.

460~~~
I was actually thinking the exact same thing the other day.

461~~~
It was the biggest mistake in that Darmian was marginally not in line with the CBs while Valencia was wandering through the penalty box wondering what the offside rule is and why the other defenders have gone forward.

462~~~
Think you need to have a look again before laughing at other people.  Valencia was marking another player while thr player who scored beat the offside trap regardless if valencia was there or not.

463~~~
Yeah, checking again it seems that the player was onside anyway... still doesn't take away from the fact that if you watch the whole clip, Valencia is totally caught between two minds regarding whether he should stay with the defender or push out, looking more indecisive than any defender I have ever seen at the top level.

464~~~
Poor again. But I still insist he's good to have around. A squad player that can fill in on our right side. Valencia running at tired defenders could be devastating. 

Darmian and Blind were poor too along with Schneiderland. That goal was a comedy of errors.

465~~~
He's been poor since he broke his leg. It's sad to see someone who was so brave, direct and aggressive when attacking on that wing to become someone who shys away when someone comes within five yards of him.

466~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He won the fans' and players' player of the year awards the season after his injury.

467~~~
The smiley was in response to the unnecessary use by someone else...

468~~~
Fair play to the guy playing with an injury. Had a poor game overall on the time he was on but great squad player to have.

469~~~
You know, I can't fault the guy when he carries on playing like this. He's a warrior

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/19/article-2584658-1C6DDFAB00000578-89_634x432.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/19/article-2584658-1C6DDFAB00000578-89_634x432.jpg"/>

470~~~
Still got people in here defending Valencia over everything eh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Happened last year as well, I find it strange when there's staunch Rooney supports who won't accept any flak but Valencia, I just don't get it. 

He was a great winger but he doesn't meet the standard in any position these days.

471~~~
I actually thought seeing Darmian at RB would have made people realise what we've been missing the past couple of seasons but some still think Valencia can do no wrong. Sunderland's best chance on Saturday came down his side when he was out of position and his positioning last night we comical. He is not a right back and doesn't have that natural instinct of where to be.

472~~~
I see someone somewhere has created on online petition to sell him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://trollfootballnews.com/2015/09/30/manchester-united-fan-sets-petition-sell-valencia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trollfootballnews.com/2015/09/30/manchester-united-fan-sets-petition-sell-valencia/</a>

473~~~
I wish people would stop peddling this myth; his best season came after the injury.

474~~~
I don't care if we recall Blackett and move Darmian back, please just no more. 

It sounds harsh, you can't fault his effort, good servant etc etc. But objectively speaking, quality wise he just isn't up to it. And it's not only his fault either, he was never a right back. We should have had the foresight to see that wingers covering our excellent first choice options was never going to cut it once our usual defensive injuries kicked in. 

I think Tony is as average as the next man these days, but this falls on the manager too imo.

475~~~
I'd rather play LVG fullback than Blackett.

476~~~
I was only half serious to be fair. But it's been clear for a while now, this season, last, the year before that, he can't play there. We've had time to rectify it, but he survives the cull somehow. Power, strength, pace, always fit, tries his best. All excellent traits and I love the guy, but it's getting a bit silly now.

477~~~
Got to the stage where I've given up on him ever being culled so I just grin and bear it. His decline has been unbelievable.

478~~~
He shouldn't be at right back in European games. Against weaker English opposition perhaps, but only when there's no one else available.

He looks like the incredible hulk these days.

479~~~
Yep, just look how good Shaw and Darmian are and you can easily see how bad Valencia is at right back.

480~~~
Regardless of the fact that he's a great athlete, warrior, dedicated, professional, had a few good seasons years ago, people like him.... That's all by-the-by. Man Utd shouldn't be in the business of sentiment. Bottom line is, Valencia is nowhere near good enough to be on that team. Problem is, with Shaw and Rojo injured Luis has no choice (he's not going to give McNair a start there despite his youth policy).
If it hadn't been for Shaws unfortunate injury, we would barely see Valencia this season. As it stands, we're stuck with him for now, unless LVG fancies Young in there. (I'd have young playing RB all day before Valencia)
What I literally cannot get my head around is is complete inability to play the game anymore. Surely the coaches should be taking him back to basics and showing him that crosses are meant to beat the first man! His decision making is terrible and there is little or no end product & against this season, like the Arsenal game last season, he's shown us that he's completely positionally unaware and therefore, a liability.
Thanks for the memories Tony, but once Shaw is back on his feet, please close the door on your way out.

481~~~
This was the main thing for me. Every defender, especially new to playing at this level, is going to make mistakes but they should never look as clueless as to how defending is done as Valencia did. He's just completely caught up in his own head of trying to figure out where to be without any idea of what is going on with the rest of the defence. He's never going to be a decent right-back, only a failed winger makeshift RB.

482~~~
Darmian was perfectly entitled to push up. As a full back its his job, and other players move across to cover him. That goal was the fault of tired legs/not being switched on early in the game. Darmian didnt push up quick enough, Schneiderlin should have gone out so Blind didnt have to, and Smalling came across too far. In the midst of all that Valencia was standing still clueless as to where he was supposed to be. 

The others knew what they were supposed to do but were too slow doing it. Valencia just didnt know, and its not the first time.

483~~~
Their goal was a collective mistake. Darmian and Blind getting were too slack out wide and Valencia was far too deep. He' need to be able to see his team mates and be pushing up. I think he'd have been still onside had he pushed up in line but it would have been a much harder decision for the linesman than it was.

Harsh to call it Valencia's fault alone but I still think he's a massive liability as a right back, which isn't his fault seeing as he's a winger (of sorts).

484~~~
The funniest thing about the goal regardless of who was at fault is Valencia actually does step up to play offside and he's still ahead of the player even after that.

485~~~
Valencia isn't a full back. He plays there because he's not a winger either. A winger can cross a ball. Maybe a few players made mistakes for the goals, however if I'm Valencia and I see where the other defenders are? I'd be stepping up. This isn't the first time Valencia has been miles behind the other defenders.

It's not a nice guy contest. How he's still at the club is a mystery. He offers nothing offensively. Nothing. Zilch. Zippo. He's just as likely to trip himself up as he is to hit the first man as he is to run the ball out of play. Liability.

486~~~

487~~~
He's capable of better than what he showed against Wolfsburg, he's had some good games for us last season.  Unfortunate that he was caught cold in that attack, really "deer in headligihts" stuff which made him look really bad. Regardless, I'm sure LvG/Giggs would have had more than a word with him on that.

488~~~
<b><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: #ff0000">It's not a nice guy contest, Nobles!!!</span></span></b>

<span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: #000000">Shit got real. These footie geniuses ain´t fookin´around. Zilch!!!

Doh!</span></span>

489~~~
It's not unfortunate at all, he does it all the bloody time. When he came on against Spurs first day of the season, we went from having no attacks down our right flank, to him being caught of position like 3 times in 15 minutes. There were a huge amount of goals that "coincidentally" came down big gaping holes in our right flank last season in big games like Monreal ghosting in to score in the FA Cup (then a complete feck up with the backpass to lose us the game), City's first goal in the 4-2 (there was also a moment where he made the exact mistake as vs Wolfsburg, but because he was fast enough to get across to Aguero everyone thought it was good defending <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>), Hazard's goal at Stamford Bridge, Everton's goal where he just let Mirallas run through and this is just off the top of my head. 

Many of these aren't obviously his mistake, but his ball watching and positioning is just awful and his lack of defensive instinct just causes panic and means that everyone loses their shape trying to compensate. I recall Smalling playing as a RB pretty much half of City at home last season, and also getting sent off because Valencia had gone awol and let Milner run in behind him in the away game. I bet my bottom dollar that Smalling much prefers playing next to Darmian than Valencia.

The reality is that Valencia should not be at this club. He hasn't been any good since 2012. He's so shocking in his original position that we have to play him as a fecking defender, where's he's still shocking going forward and apart from being big and fast can't defend for his life. I can see why Valencia was defended heavily by some, but now people are realising he's just shockingly bad. I mean he used to be one of my favourite players, no nonsense, traditional winger, no-ego, no-emotion machine at his best terrorising full backs over and over with no respite, putting goals on a plate for Rooney. He came back from a horrific injury to be our player of the season and displace Nani in the form of his career with us. But since then he's been shocking, and I think he's developed just a terrible mentality where he doesn't want to take any risks - the type of player who feels burdened by the Man Utd no 7 and goes back to 25.

He's just not a RB either, maybe RWB where he doesn't need to defend or attack he just should be gone. I've honestly never seen a player consistently bad for three seasons still outlast so many other players and still get games for us. I've pretty much said everything about him in the past, I spent half of last season pointing out to those in denial but a substandard RB an RW he is, I'm just shocked he's still getting games for us. Which is a shame, because as I said before, I used to be a massive fan of him.

491~~~
No idea what you are talking about. Come to think of it, the previous posters after my post - I have no idea what his point is either. So educate us my 'net' buddiez. I'll tell you something. Valencia makes more money then most people here. Now, that's an insult and thank God you don't have to be a 'footie' genuis to get it...

492~~~
Nobby posts in this thread are equal to Valencia's crosses.

493~~~
Do we reckon he'll start tomorrow or not then?

494~~~
I know I'm in the minority but I would start him.

The guy is a beast and the last thing Arsenal want to see is a physical player on the other side. Throw tactics, technique and ability to one side. One thing you need when facing Sanchez is good physical attributes and Valencia has that in spades. No doubt his defensive awareness is lacking compared to a natural defender and he can be frustrating on the ball but I think games like this call for a bully and if someone can get the better of Arsenal players, it's Tony V.

Just hope I don't come in here post match and see people abusing the hell out of him. Hopefully we get 3 points and the mood is positive, I have faith in him.

495~~~
Brilliant post on youtube: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqGm7N7CHJk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

496~~~
I don't hate Valencia, I am just astounded by his decline and even more astounded that a player that has offered absolutely nothing bar constant mediocrity for so long is still at the club.

497~~~
Hard worker and good attitude. The sort of player a manager loves to work with. Unfortunately, he is an accident waiting to happen at RB and he is not good enough to play as a winger for Manchester United.

498~~~
I don't think any of Valencia's critics <i>hate </i>him. Hating him for being shit would be the height of irrationality.

Valencia's problem is that he's become a really, really average footballer and that makes people hate him playing, not him personally. Actually, I'd argue he fell somewhat below average before he was transitioned to a RB. When he was still played as a winger after his, erm, downfall, you'd have struggled to find many worse attackers in the league. Now that he's become a RB you can forgive him for his lack of attacking prowess, it's no longer needed as much. That's not to say it's not still frustrating. An overlapping, attacking fullback is crucial to most teams nowadays, yet when Valencia plays his only intention seems to be to cause death by cross, repeatedly smashing unwitting defenders with aimless piledrivers.

People might argue his 'bad form' is because he's a winger and not a RB, but that notion is comprehensively disproved by the fact that he's <i>worse</i> as a winger than a RB. He's not in a rut, played out of position nor treated badly by the manager; he's just not good anymore. It's hardly a new phenomenon. Better players than Valencia have seen themselves become really poor.

499~~~
Yet he was still a better option than Rafael! Says a lot about the nick of our squad in recent years when Valencia and Young were our 1st choice wingers also when their form was dire. Personally I think our wings still need to be upgraded to be true contenders as we are still way behind City and Chelsea in this regard. Valencia is a good squad player though and other areas need to be filled before trying to upgrade his position in the squad.

500~~~
His shot was funny. I think it would have hit the corner flag. What a joke of a footballer.

501~~~
I thought he was going to take a chunk out of Sanchez.

502~~~
I was pleased that he at least tried a couple of crosses that weren't smashed in low. That's something at least.

503~~~
"A joke of a footballer" who defended extremely well against Sanchez last year + when he came on today. 

Would've preferred him to Darmian today (in hindsight obviously) who Sanchez tore to shreds today.

504~~~
I wanted him to start today with Darmian on the left, I thought Valencia was good when he came on.

505~~~
Yep, a couple of them were perfectly good crosses which was refreshing to see given how useless Valencia in an attacking sense these days. Can't really say anything about is defending in the second half, Arsenal eased off.

506~~~
I said start him as one thing you need against Sanchez was physical attributes. Easy to say after the game but it was just so simple and you just knew Sanchez was going to have a field day against Darmian.

I have faith you in Tony V.

507~~~
If van Gaal is going to insist on playing 4-2-3-1 I'd have played Valencia on the right (and Mata at 10) to help out Darmian out against Sanchez. I know he offers little/nothing going forward but when you've got a class player like that on the left who's scored a hat-trick recently at Leicester having Mata ahead as a winger is a risky move. In the big games towards the end of his time at United, Ferguson began to favour Valencia and Young rather than Nani because they will help out full backs who can sometimes burst forward and be caught out like Rafael and Evra.

508~~~
Despite his crossing, I still want to see Valencia further forward on the right but that all depends on Rooney being dropped.

509~~~
Showed a lot of tenacity and stayed tight to Sanchez, still woefully inept going forward. Everyone but Rooney knows it.

510~~~
As I mentioned above in the thread his crossing was a bit more tolerable today. It wasn't the usual shin hitters which is the least you expect from someone who's supposed to be a winger.

Something else I thought I should add in here before I forget. I know over the last few seasons Valencia's game has dipped dramatically and his career at United has probably been saved because Rafael's was unable to find himself out of the physio room if we're being totally honest, but he always gives 100% and goes on fighting no matter how badly he's playing which is more than can be said for some our players who have a lot more ability. He does make bad mistakes every now and then and unfortunately such is the drop off in his quality he'll never be proper first choice material but there's not many players in our side who'd play on with one eye closed at time when the club was in a pretty bad moment.

Young is another one who's really improved in that aspect since van Gaal took over. His days at one time look numbered and I personally would have had no issue with him being sold last summer but he fully deserves to be in our team and has proven to be a useful squad player.

511~~~
MOTM v. Argentina 

Argentina 0 - Ecuador 2

512~~~
Well done! What position was he playing?

513~~~
Couldn't care less what he does for Ecuador

514~~~
Me too!

Must be the glory hunters playing him down or they're just wums, but the blame he gets is pretty sad. Tony V's been one of our most solid performers recently. All he has to do is stand on the pitch and the opponents loose half their flair.
We are all crying about how dull our attack is and you people manage to pick dear Tony to blame. Angry smilie here.

515~~~
Great assist, like the valencia of old. Honestly, I don't get why he gets so much flak from the fans. You're not going to find a better back up right back around. He's a physical monster.

516~~~
Those last 4 words sums him up really. Hes physically great, that's it. He doesn't have the intelligence to play at right back,  the amount of times he's ridiculously out of position is baffling, he offers nothing going forward either. As long as he's as strong as an ox and as fast a Bolt it doesn't matter though right?

517~~~
He's a player that requires space, unfortunately the way we play leaves us usually with none. 

Look at how much room he's got to break into there, I can't remember the last time a team gave us that.

518~~~
Can someone answer this?

I like the guy, I just think on the wing, it's like playing with 10 men. Valencia is predictable and he makes most full backs think their Maldini.

That performance is reminiscent of his time in 2011/12 really. Put him back on the right wing and Mata in the #10 against Everton if Rooney is injured maybe?

523~~~
Would like to see this especially after that game he had for Ecuador, his confidence will be running high.

524~~~
His final ball is pretty poor as usual in most of those clips, in truth the space Mata gets him while playing on the right should see him be able to give pretty much the same outlet from RB as RW.

525~~~
There were 6 clips of his passing/crossing ability and in just 1 of them did he play a poor pass.

526~~~
There are 3 crosses that don't get to an Ecuador player.

527~~~
If a pass doesn't get to a teammate doesn't mean it's s bad pass. Also in some of the clips he does well to get into the position and is surrounded by the opposition players and manages to pull a decent pass out of the bag, even if it didn't hit a teammate.

528~~~
Would actually like to see this.

529~~~
Two of them are just poor crosses and the other he hits the first man as he is so often prone to doing. I just don't see anything in the video that looks any different to what he does for us at RB, he's always been powerful and fast with the size to simply barge through.

530~~~
Please god no. We've already gone back to Ashley Young on the left wing, if we go back to Valencia on the right wing we'd be where we were a few seasons ago

531~~~
One of the poor crosses you elude two is when he is surrounded by the other teams players yet he still like I said gets the ball in a decent position. The other poor cross was poor I admit. The one where he hit the player I don't see anything wrong with as the player was closing him down and Ecuador still got a corner.

532~~~
Ok, rather than go around and round we'll just accept that we didn't take the same away from the vid, at any rate I don't see LvG using him as a winger, he likes his wide players to be inverted and his fullbacks to provide the crosses, so essentially Valencia will be tasked with what he's doing in the vid but from RB.

533~~~
I hope the club has sports psychologists working double time on him. It's so obvious his main hindrance is mental. The overly cautious, inhibited player we've got used to at United couldn't be more different to the bloke in that video.

534~~~
A Valencia in form is not the worst thing in the world. Doubt he will play RW though.

535~~~
So fast, so strong. His crossing needs some work, but I wouldnt mind that. Goodison park will be an extra physical encounter, and he gives us some of that.

536~~~
Yeah I agree.

537~~~
I would hope the club already has those people. 

As for Valencia, I don't understand what is broken but it has been far too long and don't see that getting fixed. For an international player who has been playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world for a long time, his lack of improvement to use his left leg is criminal. Especially for such a limited player who does not possess great dribbling ability.

538~~~
Personally I would prefer the club to invest time and money on a player that isn't the wrong side of 30 and who has been a mess for the last 2+ years.

539~~~
Mata's been one ot
Believe it or not, this isn't an either/or scenario.

540~~~
Yep.  On the Ecuador team, he is seen as the leader in the eyes of his teammates, the fans, the press, etc. because he plays for Man United.  He plays with purpose and responsibility.

541~~~

542~~~
The lad's not good enough, he's past it. Not Utd quality, his best days are behind him. Thanks for the memories, ship him out. 

<copy and paste to Rooney thread at will>

543~~~
That screenshot <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> .

544~~~
Considering his performance for his national team, he certainly doesn't look past it. People talk about him having lost pace, but look at that last run in the video above and I doubt Ronaldo would keep up. He is pretty good when he just dares to run at players; 99% of them have no or little chance of keeping up with him, the rest he outmuscles. He plays within himself at United.

545~~~
The above reel just highlights bad cross after bad cross.... if you throw enough muck at a wall some of it will stick. Law of averages means one cross is bound to be met at some stage. 
Playing within himself? Why? This makes no sense, play to your potential, or go. Having watched him time and time again perform under par, I would prefer the latter!

546~~~
The above also highlighted an assist that only a handful other players would manage simply due to his place. At two other instances he created chances that could and probably should have resulted in goals. The first cross was atrocious, but then again, how many other players would be able to bully two or three players and then run past them with such ease to create the chance? Pretty much nobody in our squad. 

Playing within himself at United means that he looks too apprehensive, too afraid to take risks and losing the ball. What he should do is play as a winger and lose the ball on occasion, knowing that he has a midfield and defense that will bail him out. Not having a go at the team or the manager here, but the player himself - he looks too timid at times playing for United. That player in the video showed none of that. I can forgive a couple of bad crosses if he just gets himself into positions; as you said, some of it will stick, which is a helluva lot better than nought.

547~~~
I cant, people forget how often this happens with him in a United shirt. He is simply an awful passer, crosser.

548~~~
No I would say the amount of crosses he's played that are bad have been over exaggerated.

549~~~
Calling him bad passer is really silly. He's a conservative passer but very very rarely misplaces a pass. Which will be one of the reasons all our recent managers (including Fergie) have tended to start him whenever he's available.

550~~~
Our slow buildup hasn't helped him over the last few seasons. From a standing start he is clueless without confidence. 

He's useful in some games though. Last year against city the way he outmuscled Aguero on a run to the byline was impressive.

I think he will start against Everton.  It will be a physical encounter so expect him and Fellaini.

551~~~
Like when is the last time you saw this in a United shirt?

553~~~
Hope he has a good game today. I'm a big fan of his. He get's far to much stick, he does have bad games, but so does everyone. His bad bits get highlighted far more than anyone else in the team and nobody really remembers what he does well, which is quite a lot.

Whoscored rated him as our 7th best player last season (7.23). Same as Ashley Young who some said had a brilliant season last year.

554~~~
One day he'll put in a decent cross, we are creating so much space down the right, needs to find a man.

555~~~
He's not very good in playing football

556~~~
He's a predictable, uninventive player. He crosses by percentage and never looks for a man. I would honestly love to see his lifetime stats for crosses that hit the first defender, the number must be astronomical.

557~~~
Opposition leave a lot of space for him, there's bigger chance they will win the ball and counter us than him delivering a decent cross. 

He has the entire flank for his own, while the other areas are over-crowded.

558~~~
Never seen a player do so little with so much space. Infuriating

559~~~
Jones getting slack for not getting to the penalty rebound first, Valencia hadn't even moved after the save.

560~~~
No one mentioning Valencia saved Jones twice in the space of about 5 seconds.

561~~~
For all his faults, I would actually be fine with him if he could at least put decent cross from time to time. It's really shame, because he wouldn't be that bad if he knew how to do something simple as that.

562~~~
I thought I saw him try and beat his man at one point. Couldn't believe it. Turned out it was Lingard though.

563~~~
Nobody would even be commenting on his performance if it weren't Valencia. He's been one of our better players.

564~~~
That was a 'save' about as much as Jones saved him after he got completely mugged by Musa.

565~~~
He's actually been better than usual tonight in my opinion. Of course doing nothing attacking wise but we've looked assured defensively down the right which is miraculous for him. Probably one of our better players in that half as depressing as that is.

566~~~
That's what I'm talking about!! Fantastic ball in!

567~~~
Really good cross for the goal.

568~~~
He was good. Delightful performance.

569~~~
It's funny how this thread is so much quieter when he does well.

570~~~
Easily the MOTM.

571~~~
Presumably because it's, you know, just after the game. I'm often a critic of him, but I'm happy to admit he showed plenty of promising signs tonight and made a good cross for the goal. I'm sure he'll be getting plenty of praise from others as well.

572~~~
Thought he was great

573~~~
Very good today. 
I feel dirty typing this.

574~~~
Sorry I'm going to cause a lot of upset here. But the cross was not close to "fantastic" or "really good". The only good thing about it was that it made it into the opposition box and found a friendly player. It was lofted and had no pace on it.It's the lowered standards for him that people raving about it.

Martial's header was what can be called fantastic and really good.

575~~~
Good game. Shame he needs 20 attempts to deliver a good cross.

Still think he's at least as good as Darmian out there.

576~~~
Doesn't always deliver the greatest of balls in, but he's constantly up and down the pitch. Really good performance by Valencia.

577~~~
Very good game from him today. Looked strong.

578~~~
MOTM

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1017552/Live/Europe-UEFA-Champions-League-2015-2016-CSKA-Moscow-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/10...eague-2015-2016-CSKA-Moscow-Manchester-United</a>

579~~~
I think very few people are calling it a genuinely "fantastic" cross. It wasn't out of this world, but it was still a well placed cross which was able to find Martial perfectly. It's a lot more accurate than what Valencia typically produces from his crossing.

580~~~
I hope he hasn't used up his quota of good form in tonight's game only. Darmian is close to a suspension and we'll be needing him again soon.

Classic Valencia 10 mins after the goal though. Fresh from a good cross and high on confidence, he bursts forward and pulls a terrible cross out of the bag. We'll miss him when he's gone.

581~~~
Had a couple of dodgy positional moments defensively but it was his best performance attack-wise in a long time.

582~~~
Motm. Also, one of his crosses were put perfectly 45 degrees out - why are there no United players attacking that space? Half of Lampard's goals came from exploiting that space. I remember Evra also placing them 45 degrees out, but few United players (bar Scholes) attacked that space, so it's not something new. Look at Arsenal how they cluster they 18 yard box with crosses. We have two men inside the box and none around it. It's not very easy to make good crosses.

Also, people not saying it was a good cross. Seriously - what else is there to moan about, it not being a full moon today?

583~~~
Hes a great player to have, a real soldier, physical monster, top fitness, apart from his blind crosses, I think hes a pretty solid player, most clubs would love to have a player like him

584~~~
Good going forward, same old issues going back the way.

He's guilty of being out of position far too often to be a serious regular at right back here. 

Good nonetheless.

585~~~
His (lack of) crossing ability is about the most frustrating thing ever, but he was brilliant today otherwise. Made some good runs and defended well.

586~~~
He does make it harder to be on the right side centre back as he leaves a lot of space. That said, it isn't down to him being lazy - he sprints up and down like a man possessed. He actually looks livelier as the game progresses - Musa gave him a run for his money in the first half, but in the second half, Valencia ran past him like he wasn't there.

587~~~
He played decent tonight. He didn't attempt to smash every cross along the ground tonight and we actually managed to score from one, hopefully it's a sign of things to come.

588~~~
Almost voted for him as MOTM but Herrera prevailed at the end. Going forward he showed more than a glimpse of the old Valencia.

589~~~
He was much improved on his usual level, but i didn't think it was anything drastically brilliant. A nice run and cross for the goal, but other than that he still frustrated at times.

590~~~
I thought he was quite good.

591~~~
Poor crossing but a good outlet on the right

592~~~
If he'd been shit nobody would've waited for the game to end so that's nothing to do with it.

593~~~
Good game

594~~~
well he had an assist for our only goal...

595~~~
Yeah, I said he played well, forgot to quote my own post for the cross thing.

596~~~
Probably my 2nd best player behind Herrera, did ok going forward.

597~~~
He was good defensively because they didn’t push us much. He is a great fullback when he has to chase a player, it works against teams that sit back and want to counter us. I don’t trust him against better teams.

I don’t understand why he is getting so much praise though to be honest. Clearly the opposition tactic is to leave him space on the right because he needs 10 chances (at least) to put in a good cross (and it takes a great header to score, like the one from Martial).

I hope we stick to Darmian. With Lingard getting more playing time (and doing a lot of tracking back), I hope Darmian will be more attacking too. 

You think he was better than Schneiderlin and Martial?

598~~~
Yeah, he seemed to be getting quite a bit of the ball and trying to get some attacks going.
Schneiderlin was good too

599~~~
Done well defensively and was quick to get involved in attacks.

Looked even more menacing when Martial moved over to his side. There seemed to be a nice fluidity to their link up.

600~~~
Not sure who are you talking about?
Martial had been trying for 75 minutes and he was doubled on the left with Rojo not helping at all. Valencia had acres of space on the right plus Lingard and Herrera.

601~~~
I thought he did okay. He's never going to offer a major attacking threat. He makes a half decent right back. Not the worst squad option to have.

602~~~
Yeah, if he could only at least put in a decent cross from time to time. Jesus.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/yp0n" width="560"></iframe>

603~~~
With Valencia, I'm sorry but this is a case of a broken clock being right twice a day. It's inevitable that eventually he connects on a cross.

604~~~
Was actually reasonably good imo. He didn't give away too much down the right flank bar a couple minor positioning errors. Moved the ball the most smoothly out of the defenders until Blind came on. Provided the cross for the goal. I think some people are judging him on his attacking threat as a former winger rather than as a full-back. We'd be happy if Darmian provided what Valencia did today.

605~~~
That was from the first half, I praised him after the game. It was one in about 20 failed crosses, but still, fair play on the assist.

606~~~
His crossing has been terrible for about 3 seasons. Finally making a successful one last night doesn't change the point, when he makes crosses like that on a consistent basis then a point will have been proven.

607~~~
thought he had a good game, for sure, certainly the best in a while. Defensively solid and managed to actually put 2 or 3 decent crosses in. Good for a fullback.

608~~~
I love Valencias non reaction

609~~~
What I don't understand is that for someone who played all his life as a winger, why is he so unwilling to take in the opposing fullback once in a while. What's the point of playing a slightly defensively susceptible winger as a fullback if he will not even provide that extra impetus going forward.

610~~~
Much like Rooney's goal at Everton... One cross/assist doesn't and shouldn't mask Valencias shortcomings. He isn't good enough, by this rate we'll have to wait until 2018 before he connects with another decent cross.
Plus, let's not take away from the amount of work Martial still had to do with it, lucky it want Rooney in there or it would still be 1-0 Moscow.

611~~~
Actually put in a cross that led to a goal for once. To be fair to him he didn't do much wrong yesterday, good thing about having him in the team you know he won't get beat for pace or power against the quicker players.

612~~~
Anyone else wouldn't be against him at RB and Darmian at LB for City?

613~~~
Would be a good option against Sterling.

614~~~

615~~~
Haha despite his crapness at times over the last few years, i got a lot of time for him, you gotta love Tony's passion and fight.

He would have destroyed Sterling and Wilshere, god that video reminds of how much of a cnut Wilshere is.

616~~~
Yep, and I don't think Rojo or Blind will be able to handle KDB on the other side.

617~~~
God Andy Townsend is annoying in that clip. Gets paid to talk about football and unable to draw any connection between Valencia's reaction to a potential leg-breaker of a tackle and the fact he once had to look at his own foot pointing completely the opposite direction to the way it's supposed to.

618~~~
Thought he had a good game, saved Jones' ass when he misread the bounce and musa was away on goal. His pace and strength really does help in those last man encounters, or it could have been 2-0.

I think he supported lingard really well, he just needs to attack his fullback more and be much more consistent with the positioning of his crosses. They are either too lofted and close to the keeper, or too curled backwards and out of the area.

619~~~
Considering Darmian´s inability against decent wingers, i.e. Tadic and Sanchez, Valencia could be a good shout against City. He looked very solid against them last year.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iy12iCyt4Ug?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

620~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

The witch-hunt continues...

621~~~
Huh?

622~~~
He attempted 10 crosses, 4 of them got to a teammate. That's not bad.

623~~~
I get it. Valencia gets a lot of unfair stick. You feel the need to stick up for him. Fair enough. It's your constant desire to stick the boot into Darmian that's getting tedious.

624~~~
I still don't count that as a "good" cross.  I mean, Martial had to step towards it and jump.  So it's really still been 3 years since he's delivered a good cross.

625~~~
A cross that a striker needs to step towards and jump in order to score a headed goal? Must be utter shite.

626~~~
I find it encouraging he isn't just smashing his crosses along the floor now. We've had nothing but that for about 2 years so someone must have had a word with him about it.

627~~~
Good cross. Good player for us and him and Darmian exchanging the rb position will keep them both relatively fresh for this long season.

628~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So you have watched and remember every single cross in the last 3 years that Valencia has put in? You must have.

And regarding this cross Martial could have probably taken on with his right foot but he preferred to header it probably making it harder for himself.


Darmian should be on the left Valencia should be on the right imo.

629~~~
Yeah, agree with this. Darmian should still be first choice normally, just not so sure against Sterling.

630~~~
Might move him to LB . Its between him and Blind , with Jones back in favour at CB.

631~~~
He varied his crosses yesterday which was surprising.

632~~~
I was being sarcastic <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But it tells you something about the type of stick that Valencia gets here that it can easily be taken as serious.

633~~~
I want him to start against City.

634~~~
I had a feeling you were, but just in case <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

635~~~
I find it strange that people are wanting him to start ahead of Darmian, who is far better a defender (even if he has had 1 or 2 bad games).

636~~~
Its never black and white..people want him to start against a type of winger that Darmian has proven to struggle against in the league..that doesnt mean Darmian is a poorer defender, its just common sense. Valencia coincidentally has done well against that type of attacker. 

If people could consider that objectively, they would see that. Playing a player ahead of another at times is  all part of tactics geared to a particular opponent, not some all encompassing statement about their relative abilities.

637~~~
Yes, I agree..they are  both not perfect there..but that is defensively solid for me.

638~~~
I personally don't think Valencia would have made much difference vs Arsenal. To say Darmian struggles vs a certain type of attacker is very knee Jerk and of course people haven't watched him for Torino or Italy then. The subset is just too small, he was one of our best players in the opening 5/6 games. He had a couple of poor games in a new league, I don't think its the end of the world, it is to be expected.

639~~~
Darmian's good but Valenica is a far better athlete. 

City is coming up and so not really that strange selecting him considering he'll be playing up against Sterling and De Bruyne

640~~~
Sigh

641~~~
Don't think he would have faced a Sanchez quality winger in Italy. I do think he is struggling against certain types of players but doesn't mean he can't learn to play better against them.

642~~~
He has struggled in this league so far against them..and has had to be hooked off at HT. Van Gaal as manager will judge him on his performances this season, not his performances for Torino. 

I never said it was the end of the world, I just said that Valencia has done quite well against such attackers, seeing his performance for example when he came on for Darmian against Tadic. Id rather not argue this Valencia v Darmian debate, like them both and have no problem with them being rotated depending on who our opponent is. 

Whether Valencia would have made a difference against Arsenal or not, thats a purely theoretical argument with no proof either side which I'd much rather not argue.

643~~~
I take it this means you think Valencia isn't faster or stronger then Darmian and we should play Darmian against Sterling and De Bruyne.

644~~~
What are such attackers? Tadic and Sanchez are completely different styles of players.

645~~~
No. It means that him being faster and stronger doesn't make him a better defender.

646~~~
Who? Sanchez and Tadic? Games where the whole defence struggled because the midfield did not do its job. It was 2 games, where in honesty the whole defence was not very good

647~~~
I never said he was a better defender, but it makes sense to play Valencia against the pace of City after Darmian's showing against Sanchez.

648~~~
Against L´Arse, Valencia made a world of difference when he came on, although in fairness, the damage had been done and they had taken their foot off the petal. And Valencia has been quite effective against Sanchez in the past.

In reference to Southampton and Tadic, LVG says it all:
<i>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> boss <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal</a> has revealed that his decision to substitute Matteo Darmian against Southampton was purely tactical - because he couldn't cope with Dusan Tadic.

"He [Darmian] gave too much space to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dusan-tadic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tadic</a> in my opinion, so that's why I brought on Valencia," declared the United chief.

<b>“I didn't see Tadic in the second half, did you?</b>

"It was a tactical change because Tadic had a lot of space and was very dangerous for us.

"I wanted to eliminate that with Valencia and he did that very well I think."
</i>

649~~~
Darmian was hardly the weak-link and reason we lost to Arsenal. Everyone was crap, we'd end up dropping the entire team, at least Darmian was up against one of the best player's in the League as an excuse. Valencia has had plenty of bad games at fullback, Darmian has one and he can't play against any big teams it seems.

650~~~
It's not just because Valencia would be faster at closing down Sterling etc. that I want him to start, I feel he links very well with Mata & Herrera in which we've arguably seen our best football during Van Gaal's reign. I honestly prefer Darmian as a player but I feel Valencia should start this one.

651~~~
Think the LVG quotes that Nobby quoted shows the manager felt the same way..This is turning into a silly Valencia v Darmian argument which I honestly  couldn't be bothered in...yes, its 5/6 games, but he did struggle specifically then..coupled with the fact that Valencia did handle such players relatively well last season.

Both are good rb's , each with their own flaws, but I like them and wish them both the best.

652~~~
He was at fault for both Sanchez's goals hence why LvG brought Valencia on at half time. He was too slow to track Sanchez's run to the near post for the first goal and Sanchez was too quick and nimble for him for his second goal. The collapse wasn't entirely his fault but he played a part.

And I forgot about Valencia having to come in for Darmian against Southampton as Nobby posted above. We could start with Darmian against City but I have a feeling we'd be bringing on Valencia again.

Darmian's showed he's not as effective as some like to think and he's struggled against nimble and pacey players before. Putting him against Sterling has the makings of another bad day at the office.

653~~~
You can´t get around the discussion of Valencia vs Darmian. Our last matches since PSV has made this more than obvious. Darmian is certainly our future, and should thus be given the opportunity, but he is far from convincing.

654~~~
Thats the thing, neither are fullproof, the problem is that in this debate, neither side wants to concede that point. They are things which Valencia does well that Darmian doesnt and vice versa..

The problem is that a lot of people had themselves convinced that the arrival of Darmian was the end of Valencia. But you cant keep him down. I think Darmian has been overplayed this season, and having Valencia means we can rotate them well. All in all, United gains in the end.

655~~~
I'd give him a start on Sunday. That game vs CSKA was better than anything Darmian has produced this season going forward. Not talking about crossing as that was still inconsistent (though the cross for the goal was good), I'm talking about actually getting forward, basic passing and first touch - would rate him higher than Darmian in all of those areas.

Would play Darmian at left back as he should be able to handle Navas' pace

656~~~
Valencia has to start to simply stop Sterling or De Bruyne. Darmian on the left I guess.

657~~~
This

658~~~
As I expected, he starts..hope he has a great game.

659~~~
so poor our fullbacks these days, Valencia and Rojo. I wish Valencia ever start playing like in his Bale season

660~~~
Get behind him people and stop wrongly writing your own player of before he has even kicked a ball. Hope he does great today.

661~~~
His pace will be crucial. His lack of defensive awareness could be disastrous.

662~~~
You are wasting your energy..let them moan.

663~~~
Quite a change from Shaw and Darmian at the beginning of the season. Oh well...

664~~~
Well, at least he's gonna have plenty of space, with Kolarov being their LB. Rooney will be delighted too.

665~~~
Darmain and Shaw are excellent and our two back ups Valencia and Rojo are more than capable!

666~~~
His crossing is shite.

667~~~
He's only had one, the first was deflected.

Give the man a break.

668~~~
First one was shite aswell. 2nd one was criminal.

669~~~
I wish he had one more trick in his locker.  For all his sprinting abilities, he's rubbish at everything else.

670~~~
A physical beast but offensively lacks any talent at the moment to be threatening.

671~~~
He's been fine, you guys are far too critical.

672~~~
As with the Rooney thread.

It's something of an aside, but Valencia's touch is incredible.

673~~~
He's been doing a great job.

674~~~
It really is. Something he's never lost.

675~~~
I'm not his biggest fan but he's been good so far. Clear to see why he was chosen ahead of Darmian to handle Sterling. He's dominated him in the strength department.

676~~~
Always had a great touch and today he is being positive and taking men on the only thing is his crossing is erratic as usual. But playing well and forcing himself on Sterling well.

677~~~
Defensively been sound.
He's destroyed anything threatening we've had on our right.

678~~~
His strength and pace is obviously immense but I do worry about his positioning nous and how much is going down the right channel and causing danger. His crossing is meh, but that I can deal with.

679~~~
He's been not too bad, looked threatening at times.

680~~~
Has done very well so far. If only he could cross well with much greater consistency

681~~~
First one was deflected by Kolarov.

Fine half from him. I think he's the best right-back at the club.

682~~~
Just keep Sterling in his sight and hes golden. No interchanging at all from City which is good for Valencia. He is doing well so far, keep attacking Kolarov and take his time when putting a cross in.

683~~~
Did well against Sterling. De Bruyne now.

684~~~
Was good defensively had sterling in his pocket.

685~~~
What do we think of the injury?

686~~~
Unlucky for him, what that a hamstring or what? Thought he was good today.

687~~~
Had a rock solid performance today. He put the straps on De Bruyne and Sterling and looked alright going forward.

688~~~
Did well today. One of our better players.

689~~~
Shaw is no doubt excellent full back with world class potential and already one of the best in the league. Darmian's potential is much lower but he can do a job for us, I'd be satisfied with him as a cover for both positions LB, RB and we entered the market for another fullback we need on the right, Valencia's good servant and certainly can put in a shift but I wouldn't cry if we sold him and bought finally a manchester united quality right back

690~~~
Good performance, more than justified his selection

691~~~
No final ball as usual but at least puts the opposition on the back foot, hope his injury is only minor, maybe he shouldn't have played on as he seemed to hurt his ankle in the first half.

692~~~
Very impressive defensive display. Barely noticed Sterling was playing.

693~~~
His injury in the first half really halted his marauding runs forward which was unfortunate. He really does own that right wing when on song. His final ball's endlessly frustrating but his attacking contribution is great in spite of that.

694~~~
Was it Kompany who did him in?

Dirty player, I remember he smashed into Blind's ankle last season too which got him injured for the next few games.

695~~~
Think it was the challenge he started limping after in the first half that had the conclusive effect on him. It was him against Sterling at some point when Sterling stood on his foot or something and Sterling got hit in the face or something.

Played very well today by the way.

696~~~
it was nice to see him actually take the full back on a few times today, shame he still can't cross for shit but i thought by his own standards of late he had a good game, bossed citys latest shiny things

697~~~
Did his job, as expected...Hopefully the injury is nothing serious..Darmian should start against Boro though

698~~~
How many other top 4 clubs would have Valencia as a right back?

699~~~
Not this nonsense again, Chelsea have Ivanovic as rb who has been abysmal beyond measure, and Baba was benched yesterday for Zouma who is a cb as rb.

700~~~
Very good today and a good decision to play him.

Final ball is lacking but least he can get the ball and immediately put us on the front foot.

701~~~
Didn't give Sterling a sniff.

702~~~
One of our best players today, it's a shame he had to go off it was easily his best performance this season without question.

703~~~

704~~~
I don't think thats true, but if I had to pick one of them to go toe to toe against a pacy winger it would probably be Valencia. He gets caught out sometimes when he has to do proper defending but he can basically bully anyone with his physicality. Probably should have played against Arsenal.

705~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> At his self-critique on Instagram: "The fans witnessed far too much sideways passing. <b>Also if you could cross you would be a decent footballer.</b>" He has gained a lot of humor lately that man.

706~~~
Played really well today.

Still can't cross.

707~~~
Was glad to see him finally take on the full back... Didnt come on as often as I would have liked and when it did his crossing was poor but atleast there was intent. We need him to do that more often specially as Mata likes to come inside so Valencia needs to provide the width and crossing.

708~~~
It's a shame he can't use his left foot. There were a few moments when he could have put a nice ball in with his left foot after cutting inside, but he seems to have absolutely no confidence in pulling it off. Can't we get him a personal "left-foot" coach or something?

But still, he did a good job overall.

709~~~
That was  an awesome performance from him. All that fear of trying to dribble past anybody was gone and he tried his best. I don't mind seeing someone fail here and there while giving it their best go. I think this is the first performance in two years I've praised for him and even his poor crossing can't be put on him, we had one target inside the box in Rooney. 

Martial needs a more free role if he plays out wide left so he can enter the box from the left at any chance of a cross from the right. Just silly to have him stand out wide left in those situations.

710~~~
Could he be finally growing into this role .Good going forward and defended well against De Bruyne.

711~~~
You don't even need a free role, it should really be common practice that when the ball is out the right, the left winger shifts inside and vice versa for the other side. It happened all the time with Adnan last season and it never made sense to me. If we are attacking down the right what is he offering standing on the left touchline? Absolutely nothing. You got to shift with the play but I can only assume van Gaal is telling them to hold the width no matter what.

712~~~
Valencia was honestly my favorite United player the season before he got injured, but especially his first season back from that injury.

Instrumental in our title win that season IMO.

Watching him now (in general) is so frustrating, but I still think he is a decent option at RB and had a pretty good game against City.

713~~~
This man is a true warrior. Very little wingers can cope with his athleticism. The few times he burst down the flank, Sterling tried to catch up but bounced off him instead.

714~~~
Was the right choice for this game. I'm one of the few that think he's a very good right back. Other games Darmian may be a better choice. Glad we have them both.

715~~~
Any update on his injury?

716~~~
On the ball its not even a contest. He is miles ahead of Darmian in that respect. Think Darmian is better positionally and potentially defensively but thats still to be seen.

No doubt that Valencia should be first choice RB at this time IMO, wouldn't mind seeing Darmian on theleft again

717~~~
Darmian a much better defender who had a couple of shit games. Tony was magnificent on Sunday and I have a lot of time for him but he gets into some terrible positions at times.

718~~~
He's the most easily marked player in our team along with Rooney. It's frightening how such a one dimensional player has risen so far in the game. Does nobody sit him down to watch videos of himself and point out that blasting the ball against the opposition fullback ten times a game just isn't working? When he tries to beat a man, it's just kick and rush. I mean, how can you be a winger or wingback or whatever, and have zero tricks? He's Stewart Downing when he played for Liverpool. Run up to an opponent, stop, turn, pass it back or sideways, rinse and repeat. 

If he played for someone else, would anyone here want to buy him?

719~~~
That was one of his better performances. Really kept Sterling and De Bruyne in his pocket. Says a lot that. Still don't understand whether he is a reliable back up for Darmian or LVG will keep rotating that position between the two

720~~~
What exactly did he provide after running down the flanks? He faced up against Kolarov who always forced him wider and his cross ended up out of play most times.

That being said, had a decent game defensively but was still caught out a couple of times with stupid tackless or bad positioning.

721~~~
Might be a very unpopular opinion but I think most teams in the world would be happy to have a player like Valencia. Not as a starter for the top teams of course, but he's an excellent squad player to have for any club. Can play both right midfield and right back, and has physical attributes that pretty much nobody in the world can match apart from Ronaldo. He's also always a very reliable option to play to carry the ball forward out of defence and generally relieve pressure. Sure, his final ball has gone to shit the last few years, but he does so much good that it by far outweighs the bad.

I remember when United played against Bayern in the champions league with Moyes, and Pep was saying United still have world class players despite the league position, like Rooney, RvP and Valencia. He's just a very useful player to have, and is almost the perfect partner for Mata on the right because he can completely dominate the right flank if he's on his game, always running forward and always running back, and out muscles just about anyone.

Darmian is a better right back, but if you want someone to man mark and stop an opposing winger, I'd pick Valencia. He shut down Sanchez last season, shut down Hazard in the past, and Sterling was hardly noticed on the weekend. Not to mention that he's great with his overlapping runs. It's just his final ball is so bad that he wastes those positions.
Think Van Gaal said after the game that it was a kick on his foot, so hopefully nothing more then a little knock. Probably won't play in the cup game but will be back for the weekend I'd guess.

722~~~
Didn't watch the game. So,was he outpaced by Sterling?

723~~~
Sterling was just awful. Valencia dealt with him well.

724~~~
Sterling barely touched the ball and was subbed out for navas, meaning de bruyne moved left and he had similar luck as sterling.

725~~~
Thanks for the update guys. Good to hear he dealt with them both,different as they are.

726~~~

727~~~
Fake account.

728~~~
I thought something was strange about that, especially as he referred to himself as 'you' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

729~~~
On a serious note, we all do have a bit of Antonio Valencia in us. When we don't smile when we should, when we deliberately hit someone in the shins when having a kick about at the park or that one time when we were too busy looking at our phones when walking and hit a lamp post.

Technically we are all him.

730~~~
I thought it was just me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

731~~~
Quality post.

He's such an underrated fullback.

732~~~
Glad people are finally getting off his back. I assume one mistake and the mood will change though.

Was over the moon to see him play well though. As above, such a great player to have in the squad.

733~~~
Yep such a great player to have in the squad. Can't believe the majority saw it as Rafael was superior and should be not sold. Very reliable player Valencia and you never know competition might just spur him on to get back to his best.

734~~~
He was the weak link in our defence last season when playing as RB. He's looked better in the minutes he's played there this season.

His crossing is appalling though.

735~~~
It is annoying, most of the time he doesn't even try to look and aim at player's. When he does, he can deliver decent crosses (Martial's header).

736~~~
Might need an operation. He was playing well. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

737~~~
Oh no, it never rains but pours for us and Injuries. Anything to do with those screws that were removed?

738~~~
The challenge seemed innocuous. It's a real shame. At the moment I have more faith in him against powerful wingers than Darmian. Darmian is new to the league and Young isn't a RB at all. Not ideal.

739~~~
Source? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

740~~~

741~~~
Will be a big loss very underrated part of our team!

742~~~
LVG doesn't know any of our players names - Anthony Valencia 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2702217/antonio-valencia-gets-the-lvg-treatment-after-mike-smalling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/the-to...ia-gets-the-lvg-treatment-after-mike-smalling</a>

743~~~
Funny, but a bit embarrassing at the same time, at this point.

744~~~
Technically he IS called Anthony <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

745~~~

746~~~
crap, that sucks<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> any idea on how long he will be out for?

747~~~
Metal pins removed from his leg then? If not something else that looks pretty serious has gone down...

748~~~
We need to sign a fullback that can cover both sides..we are always short on both sides..

749~~~
All we know is that it's a foot injury.

750~~~
I didn't see the leg there. I assumed he'd had a splinter removed from that thumb.

751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

752~~~
A quality one of those better than Darmian is like saying we need another Messi.

753~~~
It's only his left leg, he didn't use it anyways

754~~~
true, cut it off and send him back on pitch

755~~~
In some ways I think it is great that so little information is getting out into the media but I would actually prefer a bit more information about player injuries. I mean Valencia has had this operation two weeks after the injury but we still haven't had any word on what exactly happened and how long the recovery is likely to be. Wilson got injured in the first half vs Boro and again no one knows what has happened and where he is. Even Fellaini missed the West Brom game and there was no report about the injury.

756~~~
Had no idea it was a serious injury. Thought he played on through the city match so that's looking like a mistake

Actually quite a big loss IMO

757~~~
Jaysus, that's a big dressing. Might even be a plaster cast? Was that the leg he previously broke?

758~~~
thank god for those two bits of tape holding it all together

759~~~
Hope to see him back on his feet again soon. Just as people were seeing his value as well. Such bad luck.

760~~~
Out for 5 months.

761~~~
damn <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

762~~~
Just our luck isn't it? Sorry for Antonio, he was doing well...

763~~~
Is McNair fit?

764~~~
Valencia is naturally quite fit even if he isn't quite the same beast he was pre-pre-injury, so I'm sure he'll recover well. We should be looking to move him on at the end of the season anyway since he's 30 and not getting any better. Bitter blow at a time when he was actually showing some his strengths.

765~~~
This injury thing is a total myth. He suffered the injury against Rangers in the start of the 10/11 season, returned for the run-in and was one of our best players, even starting the CL final against Barca. He then had the best season of his entire career in 11/12 (the season after), where he won player of the year. He was a better player post-injury.

766~~~
I meant before-before this injury, sorry. Agree though.

767~~~
Now that Tony V is out for 5 months, do we have any natural RBs fit in the squad except Darmian? How about McNair and Varela, are they fit?

768~~~
Ah I see, perhaps I misunderstood - I was referring to the leg break. Agreed, though - Valencia is extremely fit and is supposedly one of our most professional players (if not, <i>the</i> most). I imagine he'll be taking care of himself very well. I just hope that we don't try to play him before he is ready (see Rooney vs Bayern in 09/10 or at Euro 2004) and potentially ruin his chances of rediscovering good form.

There are a lot of critics of him on here, but he provides extreme athleticism, discipline and skill no matter where he plays, even if he obviously isn't a natural defender. He's very dependable and is willing to play anywhere - these squad players are more important than most realise. I think people will appreciate him more now that he is out, unless Darmian does very well for the entirety of the rest of the season.

769~~~

770~~~
I just wrote this in another thread, but I actually think we're missing Valencia. He's obviously flawed, but the thrust he provides down the wing seems to liberate Mata, and that great run we had in the spring involved some pretty triangles between Valencia, Mata and Herrera. I don't think he's the long-term solution by any means, but a wonderful squad player to have (and a great professional as well.)

771~~~
Thought he was showing some good form too, against CSKA he stepped it up and created that assist for Martial which he headed.

Looks like we may have to go hunting for another right back that can ideally compete with Darmian.

772~~~
Absolutely no doubt. He is a huge miss at RB which says more about our situation at RB more than anything else! But either way he was playing well until he was injured

773~~~
What actually happened to him?. I mean he continued walking on the injury until he got subbed, 3 months is a pretty big lay off for a bone related foot injury?.

774~~~
We miss him. His runs creates space for others.

775~~~
Yep. Would dearly love him back at the moment.

Never thought I'd say that.

776~~~
we miss everyone until the moment the certain player starts playing and then when nothing changes we find another savior. The fact is, we are playing awful football no matter who is on the pitch. Rooney can be in the stands, Herrera and Schneiderlin can be in midfield, Mata on 10 and we would still play the same boring, utter shit football we play for the last 3 years....

Brings a tear in my eye when you see a footballer just running at pure pace with the ball in a straight line through defences.

It can be even better than a mazy Messi dribble. 

Yess I said it.

Valencia we neeed you!!!

779~~~
Wow One Direction on full speed...

780~~~
Honestly I'm missing Valencia at RB wish he could hurry up and get back to training.

781~~~
Ah, the increase in footballing abilities of players when they are missing through injury. 
I'm sure we miss him assisting in every game and scoring in every two.

782~~~
Because that's what our other full backs do?

783~~~
Hehehe. I was about to make exactly this comment.
If Valencia were to get injured for 2 years, he'd end up as the Ballon D'or winner! 

Guys, this is Valencia - the player most MUFC fans wanted sold because he sucks. Badly.
Check his average rating of 5.5...that sums him up.

784~~~
Seriously, fellow tards, Valencia has completely lost it as a winger but he's been decent cover for us at RB.  Not without fault -- the backpass against Arsenal last season comes to mind -- but decent enough as a substitute.

And if we're going to give Darmian and Varela a fair evaluation against Valencia, Antonio comes out looking alright compared to those two. Of those three, I like Varela the most as an attacking right back and Valencia the most as a pure defender.  But Darmian showed some class up and back in his first two months; I have no idea why it's gone tits up for him recently. 

As for the most long-term upside between Darmian and Varela, I give the edge to Varela.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> - folks that 'miss' him - utterly average player.

787~~~
its crazy what a shadow of a winger he is now compared to that clip. Direct, confident, dangerous

788~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

789~~~
This rating is from the highly biased caf... Don't trust it.

790~~~
Great guy though. I miss the first couple of years version of Valencia. He was best friend with Rooney's header. It felt as if 50% of our assists that season came from Valencia <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Still, hasn't been the same since that injury vs Rangers unfortunately. It's really sad.

Unfortunately not good enough to be a squad player for us anymore, but I still massively respect everything he's done for us. I love how when we score, he gives a quick pat on the back and then runs back to the half way line <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

791~~~
He's a better right back than Darmian.

792~~~
Agree with the first part but disagree with the second part. Of course we always need to look to improve all areas of the squad but we have seen this year how important he can be when Darmian is having a tough time. As frustrating as he can be, he is a great option to have in the squad. Can play multiple roles, never complains, always puts 100% in etc.

793~~~
Are you joking? Valencia was playing really well this season until he was injured. Stepped in for Darmian once his formed dropped and produced immaculate defensive performances.

794~~~
It's a weird sensation with injured players. No doubt he'll be getting slated once he returns. He could actually be kind of useful at right-back for us, but yeah, strange that people really seem to miss him.

795~~~
I don't know about others but it's half I genuinely miss him in the team (or as an option) because his qualities are obvious (freeing Mata, being an offensive/opening up spaces for others all by himself, being defensively okay) and half kidding because the situation (shite football, lack of pace, aggression, tenacity, winning mentality etc) is so ridiculous than we actually need his qualities.

796~~~
feck me he reminds me of Lucas moura in the first video

797~~~
I agree this does happen sometimes but I've always backed Valencia as a good right back. He's much better than most of the Caf believe.

798~~~
Wrong, his POTY season came after that injury.

799~~~
My God talk about rose tinted glasses, he doesn't even do 25% of that effectively when he's fit and in the team.

800~~~
Let's hope he returns a better player like he did after his last injury.

He's a physical monster but he doesn't have a clue tactically,  he spent more time out of position than in it. Bizarre the amount of excuses made for him.

801~~~
\

Based on his performances pre-injury, you're wrong there.

Still to me it's a tongue in cheek 'bring him back'. Seriousnotserious.

802~~~
I remember, especially in comparison to Nani, he seemed to "always" make the right decision with whatever he was doing. Really effective at his best, lower ceiling than Nani, but Nani was way more miss than hit at times.

After that 2 years or so though, he'd been replaced by a guy who'd race up the wing, then completely stop dead. Or just smash aimless crosses into shins.

Really shocking transformation.

803~~~
I think I remember him once having to fill in at Chelsea and he did good enough that we could tick it off as "phew got away with it"

To years later see him frequently filling in at full back is mad.

804~~~
I'm wrong?!!

805~~~
The #1 clip was against Argentina in October in a World Cup qualifier.  He was MOTM.

806~~~
Lol ok I was too lazy to elaborate but since it's subjective all I'm and others are saying is 'Valencia really isn't that bad of a player that we can totally disregard and yes we do miss right now (however limited, there are certain qualities he has that are missed; much like how I dislike Young massively but can see how he invigorated a lifeless right side against Swansea), especially in light of our recent right back offerings'.

807~~~
For all the stick he's received, nobody has been better than him at right back all season.

Miss him, hope his return is soon. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

808~~~
any idea if he's ever coming back?! been ages.

809~~~
BBC reporting he trained today with first team squad.

810~~~
As much as I don't rate him, that's welcome news. For all his flaws, he's a much better option than Varela/Love/McNair etc.

811~~~
He's our best right back. 

Darmian has made more feck ups This season this season than Valencia did in more games last season. 


Valencia had probably 2 or 3 brainfarts last year which were over blown and used as a stick to beat him with. 

Newsflash: most fullbacks make at least a few mistakes that lead to goals every season. 


Valencia also supports his winger better and as bad as his end product is, Darmian's is still worse. 


I don't dislike Darmian, he will definitely improve as he settles but I don't expect him to be out long term right back and Valencia is superior.

812~~~
Our results began to get worse when we lost both Shaw & Valencia, so i'm glad we're getting them back slowly.

813~~~
Just showed a clip of training on Sky Sports News and while it didn't show him kicking a ball, he was doing the drills with the rest of the squad.

814~~~
Big boost for the team. Hopefully he can hit the ground running

In a style of play, where we have such a slow build up, both and Valencia and Shaw are massively missed, as they often open up a lot of avenues with their great energy and dribbling skills down the wide areas, which, more often than not, creates attacking overloads. A great example of this was Valencia, Mata and Herrera on the right last season.

817~~~
Another player who is massively over-rated when he's out of the side.

818~~~
This. 

He's a below average winger that can't cross, shoe-horned into being a below average full back that can't defend... or cross. 

He's a consummate professional by his application and attitude, but he's been at Utd way too long.

819~~~
Don't agree at all. Valencia has been OK at his best with many faults including the back pass against Arsenal and some woeful positioning such as the games vs Everton and Wolfsburg.

As for his attacking play, well there is none. I can't remember the last time he contributed towards an attack.

Yes Darmian hasn't been great, but he doesn't need to do much more to oust Valencia in our first XI.

I should add that it's great to have him back. I still think he's a decent full back.

820~~~
Don't agree, he's actually underrated when he is in the side. People can't see past his days in the last SAF season and Moyes season. He's actually a very good right back imo.

821~~~
Our best RB returns. Great news.

822~~~
A welcomed cover but should be moved on this summer. Vastly overrated after one good season by fans easily blinded by graft in the absence of skill and talent. He has been getting worse with every injury and I don't see him getting any better. Varela should be ahead of him for now.

823~~~
If Valencia is the definition of a very good right back,  we are finished. Clyne is better than Valencia as a right back and I won't call him a very good right back. He is a failed winger that relies solely on his physicality,  much like Fellaini.

824~~~
I mean even if I thought he had a good season last season, which I don't, at best you're arguing for him having 1 good season out of the last 3. 

I don't think he's anything at all special at the back and his physical attributes compensate for frequent errors, and the less said about him going forward the better. The fact that I'm not certain he's actually better going forward than Darmian, who has been wank going forward himself, is testament to that. 

He's not good enough, and whilst I'm happy he's back as cover, the fact that we shipped so many average players out but kept him is bizarre.

825~~~
He has been better than Darmian even though it doesn't say much. Yes, his crosses are still shite and his positioning is suspect, but he does offer alot more attacking wise, and it has been obvious especially with Mata playing out wide, Darmian haven't been capable of doing Valencia's role.

826~~~
I miss Tony (not for his brainfarts and shin-crossing) as a reliable option at RB, and a good player to have available in the squad. Was playing well before getting injured. 

Hopefully we see him back playing soon.

827~~~
Good he's coming back but I expect him to be in the U21s like everyone else that comes back from injury.

828~~~
He's a great outlet in the sense that his first touch is actually freaking great, he never loses the ball, good (steady) passer and he can easily run with the ball 30-40 yards relieving pressure and turning defence into offense.

That being said he hardly ever creates anything and loses his man too often for my likening. The latter actually not so much this season though, I think he was great in the beginning of the season.

829~~~
Grabbed a great assist from the game he got injured against CSKA for a Martial header, he actually looked really good in that game.

830~~~
Most of that is true mostly because Darmian has been absolutely terrible(as you said) apart from the first month or two, with the exception of two or three good games since then. RB is probably our weakest spot in this squad and Valencia should be nothing more than a backup, if Darmian doesn't improve then we should search for a new fullback, IMO.

Anyway, good to hear that he is close to being back.

831~~~
Great to see him training today, the more experienced players back the better. If we're going to make a serious tilt at both of these cup competitions we're going to need players back fit.

832~~~
it's positively laughable that people are getting misty-eyed at his return. an absolute non-entity of a player and a perfect symbol of the malaise our club has become since the glazers took over. 

at his age and given his dramatic regression as a player, give me varela at RB any day of the week. varela has a future, valencia doesn't.

833~~~
Mata has missed him desperately. 

Even though his end product isn't great, he's excellent at linking up, offering an outlet and creating space with his movement. People just don't care to see it because they want him to blast past the opposition fullback and put a good cross in. 


It's a pointless argument though, people just cannot for the life of them view him objectively. 

You can accuse me of being a Valencia fan boy but I was probably his most vocal critic when he was playing on the right wing. I created 2 or 3 threads with the sole intention of mocking him. Last season though, I watched him at right back and judged him on what I saw. 

He made a few mistakes, that I won't deny but every time a goal is scored you can credit it as a mistake to one player or another so over the course of a season any player is going to be blamed. A couple of the things he was blamed for was ludicrous though.

834~~~
we miss his pace as much as anything. even if he doesn't create anything else, his pace creates space for others to work in.

835~~~
This.

He gets the other teams on the back foot with his pace. Just his crossing or final ball is diabolical.

836~~~
Looking forward to him being back. His final ball is off course shocking, but in terms of running with the ball, being an attacking outlet on that side with his pace and strength, he's a huge asset. Last season people constantly ripped into him, but he had a very good season overall IMO. Overlaps really well and was one of the best right backs in the league, it's just his defensive lapses that arise on occasion are all that sticks in people's minds. But having someone dependable like him is a huge bonus, so hopefully he's almost ready to be starting and stays fit. A big part of our shit form this season was to do with 3 big long term injuries, forcing us to overuse others and getting them injured and so on.

837~~~
Glad he's back.

838~~~
Hope he enjoys his last few months at the club.

839~~~
Wasn't the game he got injured against Man city?

840~~~
Completely agree. 

Darmian was the shiny new toy that was going to be twice the right back Valencia was last season (because Valencia is a right winger only and can't possibly play a different position well).

841~~~
They're both 6/10 players. Darmian gets leeway because he's come from a vastly different league and has shown a lot of promise in some games, whereas Valencia is a coward who's decline in ability is down to his mental weakness and refusal to work on his game.

To go from United's title-winning first choice right winger to second choice right back, in supposedly the peak years of your career, is embarrassing.

In the long term, I full expect Darmian to progress and be first choice, or a very good second choice fullback. Valencia needs to go, we have too many mediocre players that have overstayed their welcome at this club.

842~~~
I'll be happy when Valencia is back easily better than other options we have

843~~~
He has been quite a miss, which says it all about this season!

844~~~
Absence makes the heart grow fonder..

He was my lowest rated player of the season on Match Day until Paddy McNair overtook him last week

845~~~
Exactly and you can even go through his thread last year and see that I don't like him but Darmian has done absolutely nothing to show he is better. Clearly this idea of just bringing in a new RB isn't as easy as thought. As I said, I don't like him but it is ridiculous the amount of people who want him shipped out. Darmian has proven to be anything but reliable and a new RB could be even worse. 

He isn't great, he isn't even good but he is decent and what he has over Darmian is he is pretty damn consistent. He is a great 1 on 1 defender, very rarely do wingers get the better of him trying to take him on. Easily better than Darmian in that regard who has been ripped to bits at times. He is awful at tracking runs and movement but we all know that and Smalling and the DM should be helping him in those situations to ease the problem. Darmian has also shown to be weak in this area often being caught out by the LW making a run in behind and across the backline. His attacking is quite poor but he still gets up the field, offers and option and is good at keeping possession, again something at which Darmian is even worse at. 

Darmian has been decent overall, some good performances and some down right awful. He certainly hasn't nailed down the RB spot or done anything to suggest we should get rid of Valencia.

846~~~

847~~~
He looked chunkier than ever.

848~~~

849~~~
Actually looking forward to see him back in the side.

850~~~
Hardly going to transform our fortunes but be glad to have him back nonetheless.

851~~~
I'll get slated for this but ffs just play him on the right wing now and tell him to try to beat his man every time - every time! He is still better than all the options we have there.

852~~~
he's going to come in, straight in the form he was that wonderful season, and really rip it up.

:-)

853~~~
His muscles have grown muscles.

854~~~
More bodies are important, but I think he's comfortably behind Darmian and Varela now.

855~~~
Don't think thats the case, I see him coming on as a sub, playing well, then keeping his place from then on in.

856~~~
I can live with that, if he is performing. I should mention that his experience is important as well. I just don't really want to see him playing at right back over genuine fullbacks on anything other than his form and merit.

857~~~
If he gets a look in over Valera then I give up.

858~~~
Wouldn't be against him being a direct option on the RW, since we have no one who can comfortably play that position, but since he came on for the reserves and played full back seems clear that he's considered a full back only now.

859~~~
Not too sure why he would be 'comfortably' behind the very unimpressive Darmian.

860~~~
Does anyone wonder what happened to Antonio the cm destroyer? He had that cracking game vs Everton at CM last season (best from him in a while) and then we never got to see if it was a fluke

861~~~
Yeah I agree, Would definitely like to see him there again.

862~~~
Give up mate. Its Van Gaal who makes decisions. Once Young is back Varela is 5th choice.

863~~~
Always nice to see a person return to full health but Valencia, the best of the bunch I'm happy to see leave at the end of the season doesn't excite me. I hope he's return makes him attractive for other clubs

864~~~
Because he's a right winger, not a fullback.

4-2-3-1, moved away from 4-3-3.

865~~~
Am, have you not watched him play the last few years, no?

866~~~
Yes, he's a winger who has been asked to play fullback for some unknown reason. Just because he's played a hand full of games there in his mid-late career does not make him a fullback. His performances at fullback have quite clearly shown that.

867~~~
Yeah but he's clearly a fullback these days and for me, he's better than Darmian.

868~~~
He's better at fullback than he is as a winger these days

869~~~
He's not a fullback. He's a winger who is being asked to play at fullback. Like I said, his squad role and his ability are irrelevant. He's a winger, which is why he should be behind the fullbacks in the pecking order as I stated above.
So he sits on the bench and waits until there is an opening in attack or defence, like I said above, behind the actual fullbacks we have in our squad and/or behind the wingers/hybridCM role players.

870~~~
Righteo.

871~~~
It is a pretty literal equation. It would be like asking Mata to play Right wing and then after his six months this season playing absolutely dreadful saying "he's a winger now" when he clearly was never a winger in his career more an attacking midfielder/#10. A bit pedantic I will concede.

I will say that if his form shows he's better on the right in any position (or at that hybrid CM role) then I have no problems with him playing there. But right now he's had a five month layoff and is back to the back of the pecking order in my opinion and I don't speak for LVG on that one because my thinking means he'll go straight back into the starting lineup.

872~~~
So even if he performs better than the right backs in the team he should wait until they aren't available to play? Are you saying players can't change roles as there abilities change? He no longer performs as a good winger so LVG found him somewhere where he is useful

873~~~
Didn't Mata play on the wing at Valencia and Chelsea? Anyway, I wouldnt say Valencia has been 'absolutely dreadful' at RB...he's been competent in most games

874~~~
I believe he's been extremely poor at fullback. He makes a lot of mistakes that a typical winger would when it comes to defending, that is mainly why I don't want him to just come in and start at FB over other natural fullbacks but I conceded above that his form can keep him in the starting lineup, right now he has no form and personally I think he should be third in the pecking order behind the other fullbacks. I'd give him a dance out on the right wing to stretch his legs in the first team.

But like I also said, logic is backwards for Van Gaal and he'll probably go back into the first team straight away, that will make me uneasy as he has been out for a long time.

I believe he played from the left for Valencia and Chelsea. I should have made that clearer, right winger. Also above - I believe he has been poor but lets not start that debate as I am happy to have bodies back and I don't hate him as a player and am glad to have him back.

875~~~
I don't think is as good as people make him out to be. He has been here for 7 seasons now and he only really impressed me in one season, the season where he destroyed LBs and assisted a lot of Rooney's goals. Other than that, he has been been very very underwhelming. His other good performances came under Fergie, who frankly made every rubbish player look good. After Fergie, he has been dreadful IMO. He is a failed winger who was reverted to RB for only one reason; his physicality, not skill or defensive ability but sheer physicality. I often wonder is that is the criteria for United footballers these ala Fellaini. Since Fergie left, he has had 2/3 serious injuries and each time he returned he got worse and worse. One too many injuries for a player who solely relies on his physical ability.

876~~~
I'd be tempted to play him on the right wing with Valera at right back against Liverpool.

877~~~
Not a bad shout. At least he has pace and will get to the byline. His crossing can only improve.

878~~~
Also will help Valera who struggled to deal with Coutinho in the first leg.

879~~~
I'd have him on the right and Young on the left with Martial up top.

880~~~
Back to Valencia and Young on the wings, incredible how some people will never learn. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

881~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this

882~~~
Whilst neither Young nor Valencia are very good, neither is the likes of Lingard. At least in a game like Liverpool Valencia will be reliable defensively and allow Varela to push forward.

We have a crap squad.

883~~~
I agree. Which is why we have a desperate need to stop sticking with mediocrity. It's insane that we have Valencia, who cannot beat a man or put in a single cross all game still here simply because he's a hard worker and can play in another position which he also isn't very good at! He's also so one footed it's painful to watch. He could donate his left leg and not miss it.

884~~~
or, you know, we could actually try januzaj there for once.

885~~~
I like Januzaj, but he isn't eligible for the Liverpool game as he's cup tied having played for Dortmund. I'd be all for giving him a chance in the league.

886~~~
ah, fair enough. misunderstanding on my part.

887~~~
He's 30 years of age.

888~~~
The living in the past syndrome

889~~~
Oh yeah cos what we are doing is working so well atm.

890~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

he'll be a beast at 32 then

891~~~
I said that as in people saying he can never get it past the man. In that case it can only improve.

892~~~
Because they worked perfectly then? Time to move on!

893~~~
Move on to what?

894~~~
From the past for a start?

895~~~
Valencia has struggled in an attacking sense but he is very strong defensively and him and Varela imo would provide a lot of problems on the right wing. Young has been brilliant when he has played so he deserves a chance on the left wing.

896~~~
He's your right winger though, if being strong defensively is the best compliment to hand it's not very promising is it?

897~~~
As much I would to agree with you but Valencia is nowhere strong defensively. There isn't anything defensive in his game play at RB. He is riddled with errors. His saving grace is his physicality, which will not suffice. Valencia has only had one genuine good season at United and he gets worse with every serious injury. I would not keep my hopes up, off the back of another serious injury. Young may derseve a chance but we need to push on from players that will not improve dramatically in coming years. We don't know if he will be good enough after this injury.

898~~~
He will work tirelessly for you which will allow players like Mata to shine.

He is strong defensively and I didn't say for the next few seasons. I meant until the end of the season. You didn't seriously think I meant they would be our pairing next season?

899~~~
His defensive awareness is nil.

900~~~
Anyone want to keep him instead of Darmian next summer (assuming Varela keeps his place as a first choice)? I'm all for giving Darmian one more season etc but realistically one can't go to a new season with 3 first team RBs and Valencia is a safer bet for me for next season. Darmian is younger but if he's behind both Varela and Valencia what are we going to do with him? All of this is just hypothetical of course.

901~~~
I rather keep Darmian. Before his arrival, he was potentially the best of the available RBs. He is capable of much better performances as we saw in his first few months with us. Like most foreign players, he needs the time to adapt. Valencia is a failed winger who gets game at RB because of his physical nature. He is getting on and his recent injury does not guarantee better performances than the poor ones in recent seasons. Darmian will get better no doubt.

902~~~
You think Varela has shown enough to be first choice next season? 

His performances so far have been excellent and I really like him, but I think the defensive side of his game needs a lot of work before he can be considered a first choice for a team with our ambitions (I am still in the pre-Fergie world, where our ambitions are top honors). For next season, I see him as an able deputy with a bright future.

903~~~
Well his performance level has been better than both Darmian and Valencia so unless we buy a new RB, we can only play the best player for that position isn't it?

904~~~
Agree and by quite a bit, we should have went for Coleman.

905~~~
Sure. 

What I meant to ask was, at this stage, if you think he is good enough to be a first choice for a team with ambitions?

906~~~
No, he needs to improve his defending for sure especially positioning.But that's not a way to judge a player in his first year playing in a decent enough level.He's young enough to take his game to the next level in 2-3 seasons and I would rather pin my hopes on him than another expensive signing that might not work out.

907~~~
Fair enough. 

I so unsure about Darmian that I cannot make my mind up. I wanted him in the summer and he started very well with us but has looked atrocious for rest of the season. Don't know if we should replace with someone or give him another season and place our trust in Varela, in case Darmian doesn't come good next season too.

908~~~
I honestly think Lingard > current Valencia at wings. Though as you said neither is a very enticing option.

909~~~
Solid game, welcome back <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

910~~~
Solid 45. Few decent interceptions...

911~~~
Still fast as feck and keeps the ball well.

912~~~
He just received a ticket of 'Right Back Starting Eleven vs Manchester City'

913~~~
Glad he's back.

914~~~
He did fine when he came on, his physical gifts helped.

915~~~
I'd play him at RW against City. He'd be a big upgrade over Mata/Lingard.

916~~~
I agree. I fail to see what Lingard offers in the RW position that Valencia doesn't. And although Valencia may not be as good at getting past players as he once was, he is still miles better than lingard. He's probably better at supporting his fullback as well. I thought he should have come on for Mata yesterday.

917~~~
Good to see him back. Ignoring his final ball he's a beastly player really. It's just a shame his final ball is so bad, but considering our entire sides final ball is awful, he'll be a huge plus because of everything else he brings to the team.

918~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm happy that he is back and all but I'm really surprised with all these positive comments. I'll give him 2 games for the caf to turn on him and LVG being an idiot to play him

919~~~
He was usuall Valencia,..decent at the back, shite going forward. It took me 2 minutes to realize how much i didnt miss him.

920~~~
Our players tend to become world class in the treatment room only to become mice once they step out of it.

921~~~
Precisely. Especially the mice analogy considering it's Valencia we're talking about.

922~~~
I think Lingard's actually completed a cross this decade to be fair.

923~~~
This is true, that being said we need a breath of fresh air and hopefully Valencia can ignite the right side in some capacity. I just can't handle seeing Mata on the right anymore, it seems LVG is the only person in the world who thinks that's a good idea.

924~~~
Not sure about him just walking in the team ahead of Varela and Darmian after a long injury lay off

925~~~
if hes fit he's got a chance, the other 2 haven't exactly nailed the spot

926~~~
Valencia couldn't ignite a firelog. One of the most boring, predictable and safe players in any league in the world.

927~~~
He couldn't cross a road.

928~~~
What I see is a group of above average players (no where near to world class) who are made to play in a horrible system. Under such circumstances they will barely make any difference at all

929~~~
That's literally the first time that has been posted in a thread about Valencia. You should go to the thread about Mata and ask what's the Mata with him because that would be hilarious too.

930~~~
Seems to have made you cross.

931~~~
Yet would you prefer the unpredictability of Darmain? Given the choice Valencia all day long for me.

932~~~
Valencia has 15 goals in his entire United career. Lingard is already on 5 after three quarters of his first season.

Goal threat is definitely something Lingard has over him.

933~~~
We were more open after he came on, which could be to do with chasing a goal, but a lot of Liverpool's penetrative passes came into the channels he has never in his career managed to block - between RCB and RB.

934~~~
spot on

935~~~
He was actually looking quite good before he got injured, got an assist and nullified Sterling in the last derby.

936~~~
It's really not though. It's spot on for RAWK but united players just tend to get worse. For example, who of our injured players are getting hyped? Rooney got injured in good form but now he's shit and fat again. Jones is just Jones. I don't even know who else we have injured because they are all so shit.

937~~~
Same ol' Valencia. Now I remember why I don't miss him!

938~~~
I thought he did fine.

939~~~
What did he do well?

940~~~
He executed some of his trademark shin-seeker passes into opponents socks.

941~~~
Shinseeker <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

942~~~
Did well when he came on, made us a lot more solid on that side. Great to have him back, the biggest thing he provides is that physicality, pace and even if he is one dimensional, he kick it against those shines with conviction instead of half tapping everything like darmian has been doing.

943~~~
Like?

944~~~
He was appalling decision-wise. 

He started off with giving Aguero room for a backpost free header. Then he chased Clichy into his own half and 2 passes later Smalling almost got sent off. Finally he lost Aguero at the backpost again (and then got beaten once Aguero chested it down) but fortunately the shot was off target.

945~~~
Apart from losing Aguero off the dribble when he first came on that nearly gave him an assist, he tightened up defensively especially when he had check Aguero a lot more. He kept him quiet and forced him to take shots from way out. 

He also looked far more comfortable in possession than Darmian did and provided the physicality when we needed it. I think "fine" and "okay" fairly sums up his performance today.

946~~~
Offensively he was ok, about equal to Rojo. Not a threat but he can carry the ball out and usually keeps possession.

947~~~
It is amazing how much happiness and quickness certain United fans take in ripping apart Valencia.

Sad really.

948~~~
It's strange how he refuses to make the pass across the attacker to the free centre back, that's become vital to our possession football.

Decent performance.

949~~~
He let Aguero walk around him for that Silva cross. Bless him and his tank physique but he falls asleep a bit too often as a right back. I'm not concerned as long as the play is developing infront of him but I'm concerned when he has his back to his man.

950~~~
His positional awareness was poor. On another day, at least 3 chances would have been converted from his positional play. He was exposed far too easily and Im surprised it took City till the last couple of minutes to throw Aguero on him.

951~~~
Get over it.
Nothing wrong has been said.

952~~~
I didn't watch the game but i just watched about 10 minutes of match highlights and it seemed that every time he was out of position or not aware of the players around him. I hope he does better once he gets some match fitness.

953~~~
I quite like Tony V.  But not at RB.  Managers fall in love with his pace, physicality and think he can be an ideal RB but his positional sense defensively has been shown time and again to be lacking.  Still thinks he offers something as a rotation player at RW.

954~~~
Hearsay is so lame. Defenders even on the best games can make mistakes.

Positionally sometimes he was off but he made up for some of it;in addition, he had some nice moments going 1v1 with Aguero and brought the energy and physicality needed. 
As I said IMO,
He was not Brilliant
He was not Fantastic
He was not great
He was not good
He was not decent
He was fine.

955~~~
Thought he was fine. Better than the starting fullbacks. He can actually move the ball forward.

956~~~
He only put in 1 failed cross and people are already making shin jokes.
If  it was Varela or Fosu Mensah who did that, would they do make those same jokes? No.

957~~~
Very tidy in possession as always. Almost cost us a couple of times by losing Aguero at the back post.

Delighted to have him back though - another body in a thin squad.

958~~~
Can't deal with the ball in the air when defending at all. On the plus side he is strong and looks after the ball batter than the others in that position. He would be my choice for starting LB.

959~~~
You can't see why that might be different?

960~~~
Struggled with Aguero but it is Aguero to be fair. Put in one great tackle in the box that the haters won't have seen. Think Rojo was an accident waiting to happen today so was a good sub.

961~~~
I often wonder how he would look if he was forced to play on that left side.

962~~~
Sounds like you watched a different game. If you think that positional play was "fine" may George Best help us. If he played that way for the 90 mins we could have easily lost, no problem. Just because we won an important game doesn't mean there weren't poor performances.

963~~~
Did what he had to do. Didn't really have a lot of the ball when he come on, so he had to do a lot of defending, but I thought he was ok. People need to remember he's coming back after about 5 months. He's nowhere near fully fit yet.

964~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pretty bad in fairness. Outside of the right boot crosses. No thanks.

965~~~
Speculation is so bloody lame.

Is his performance based off on what could have happened or what happened? Me and you clearly have a different assessment, and that is completely fine but when it is based off on a theory on what could have happened, it becomes pointless.

As I said, he had some bad moments, but he also had some good moments that reflected positively for the team;thus, he was fine.

966~~~
Strangely he looked rustier today than he did on Thursday.

967~~~
You think so?
If he played on the left would he not be forced to come in on his right?

968~~~
And do what exactly? Score from the edge of the box with his wonderful shooting ability or whip some wicked crosses in with his cultured right foot!

969~~~
Seeing as the first thing he wanted to do after a 1-0 derby victory is come on and lay into Valencia you're probably wasting your breath pal.

970~~~
I was thinking it would put him in a much more encouraging position to put in better passes into the box in the final third. The evidence however suggests it would turn out to be pretty ugly.

971~~~
Probably <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

972~~~
Defensively hopeless when he came on, sometimes his positioning is awful.

973~~~
After being out of position and well behind the rest of the defense he also let Aguero in for a free header from Silvas cross. His passing was pretty average too.

974~~~
I mentioned this, no?

975~~~
You praised Darmian despite a couple of shaky spells and criticise Valencia for something that didn't happen. I love a balanced opinion.

976~~~
Show me in the post I quoted where you mentioned this?

977~~~
Can't blame him for struggling with Aguero but what really reminded me why I hate him is when he bombs forward, gets to their channel and slows down the play straight away.

978~~~
Please just stop with the guy.

979~~~
went into short circuited robot spinning mode as is expected. consistent

980~~~
Glad he's back a massive upgrade on Darmain

981~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

982~~~
He's still coming back to full fitness, so it's not fair to dump on him at this point.

I think he's great, personally. Totally shuts down his flank and forces his opposing winger backwards. It's true his attacking threat isn't great, but he rarely loses the ball, always makes himself available for a pass and wins more corners/throw-ins than anybody else in the squad. In terms of retaining possession, he's an exceptional option to have.

The way he dominates his side of the pitch, he almost makes the game 10 vs 10. He cancels out both himself and the other side's winger. Given that most teams have their most creative players on the wing, what Valencia offers is invaluable. Pooh-pooh that if you like, but there's a reason that all his managers have loved him. Some aspects of football are about what you discourage the other team from even trying.

983~~~
I wish he'd not slow down the game when he's overlapping. 

Just boot the ball in, it's what he did as a winger.

984~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

985~~~
Great post.

986~~~
I agree, just hope Darmian isn't going to be our starting left back now.

987~~~
You are making it sound like he puts every winger in his pocket. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Aguero managed to get past him with just one touch - with his chests ffs!

988~~~
Well Darmian was absolutely fine on the right side defensively. Sure his ability to cross is poor but defensively he is better than Valencia.

989~~~
That Aguero moment actually jolted me back to reality and reminded me of why Valencia is really poor as a FB when his defensive duties are put to test.

990~~~
He was not better than Darmian defensively. Was all over the place position wise and let Aguero two clear shots/header on goal. More than what Darmian/Rojo did in the first 80 mins.

991~~~
Varela > Darmian > Young > Valencia

992~~~
First choice right back without question for me. Makes such a difference to us going forward.

993~~~
Nice to have more bodies but some of his defending can be summed up by the fact that he is clearly an will forever be a winger. That piece of defending when Aguero turned inside and scuffed his shot. I dropped a bog clean when I saw him cut back. Thought Aguero was just going to stroke that straight in off the right upright. Horrible miss and Antonio was spared some major embarrassment. Losing him for that header across the box could have been costly as well.

994~~~
Didn't watch the game but the difference in opinions here is unreal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No idea whether he did well or not.

995~~~
I just can't work him out.  Defensively there's question marks over his positioning but physically he's great as he can get up and down that pitch.  As a right winger I don't think he offers enough going forward.

996~~~
I am a fan of his but would say he struggled against Aguero. The chest moment people are referencing was a world class touch from Aguero though.

997~~~
The funny thing is Rojo is that bad it's a toss up between them. Ideally Shaw but even Blind with Jones at CB.

998~~~
But overall game and going forward and linking up. Every time he gets the ball there is a real danger he gives it away. Much like Rojo on the other side of the park.

999~~~
As an aside, it's quite remarkable how two people who have played as wing backs for their respective countries can be so terrible on the ball (or in Rojo's case, just terrible).

1000~~~
I understand that Valencia is better at not losing the ball but he barely does anything with it apart from trying to break a defender's shin. As I said, I would love a right sided Shaw but if it is a toss up between Darmian and Valencia - I will pick Darmian for being a better defender. We can do without having a liability in defense.

1001~~~
There are two camps in the Valencia thread. 

Those who compare him to other right backs in which he should compare positively. 

Those who refuse to accept that he can play anywhere else but right wing and have apparently become experts on full back positioning and decision making. This expertise and in depth analysis is not seen in any other defender's thread however.

No true right back has ever been beaten by Aguero's skill.

1002~~~
Bossed his flank when came on, he practically fills the right side of the pitch, absolute tank.

1003~~~
Standard Tony.

1004~~~
I swear he must have put on another 10kg of muscle during his absence.

1005~~~
If he had variety to his crossing, he'd be some RB.

1006~~~
Did the job.  Simple as.

1007~~~
Did very well to force that foul by blocking their man and going down right at the death. There's only one winner when Valencia has the ball and he's got his back to his opposite number. He's immovable in those situations.

1008~~~
Should be starting ahead of Rojo - moving TFM to left back.

1009~~~
Did what was needed and dovetailed well with Lingard in running down the clock.

1010~~~
To be honest, this post is just a regurgitation of most posts after he plays, which is a credit to him.

1011~~~
This is why I love when Valencia plays at full back, espeically if we have someone like Mata out wide, who is going to drift inside. He constantly gives you an outlet ball. Looked dangerous throughout the first half, and created a very good assist for the goal.

1012~~~
Not his biggest fan but hopefully this mean we won't see Darmian anymore this season.

1013~~~
We've missed him hugely this season

1014~~~
Great game, love this man.

1015~~~
So much better than Darmain by God we have missed him and Shaw

1016~~~
Energy, commitment, physical and he plays for the shirt. Good lad!

1017~~~
Got caught out a couple of times defensively but added more to the attack than we've gotten from Darmian.

1018~~~
Villa created 3 chances. 2 were from our right, 1 was from a corner following a shot from our right. He was not in the fecking frame for that 1st half chance.

I'm not a football coach so I can't say what exactly he's doing wrong (in this instance, in others it's obvious even to me) but it's a consistent pattern of opposition teams making openings from his side whenever he plays.


Of course attacking-wise he's better, though Darmian does usually have 1 good cross/game too.

1019~~~
Lovely stuff from Valencia, Mata and Rooney. Probably the best moment besides the goal, which again was a brilliant set up from Valencia and Rooney

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/k5pd" width="560"></iframe>

1020~~~
So much better than Darmian. Hopefully that's the end of Darmian at the club.

1021~~~
The end of both of them.

1022~~~
Thought he was good today but what exactly he did there? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

More dangerous player would at least get a good shot out of it.

1023~~~
:|
Apart from the assist, what exactly did he do ? He was presented a golden opportunity by Mata with the lob and what does he do ? Lays a backward pass. You can't judge him from a game like this where Villa were non-existent. I like him, but I still rate Darmian higher defensively. Attacking wise, both are pretty woeful tbh.

1024~~~
That you'll always get from Tony V and that's one of the reason I'm fine with him sticking around as a squad player. The problem with him often is, people remember his outstanding season and with that in the back of their minds judge him. Those days are over now, but he's still useful as an experienced, hard-working squad player.

1025~~~
It's not really what he did its more what he didn't do! Unlike Darmain or Rojo he keeps possession well and players don't run riot against him. Darmain first 4/5 games aside has had a woeful debut season. Rojo and Memphis are both the same.

1026~~~
You are talking like LvG <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
What point is there in keeping the ball if you can't do much with it ? Rojo atleast tries to make himself a nuisance when attacking and always gets to the byline as much as he can even if his final ball is lacking. Darmian is probably one of the best at the club in 1 on 1 situations. He usually has to go up against fleet footed wingers and he does really well. He's also tactically very astute. He's also put himself in danger more than a couple of times in defending situations. Yeah, he's not great going forward, but that was never a forte of his game. Those that watched him for Italy and seen him at Torino know that. So, I am sure the scouts and the coaches at United know that as well. So why make unrealistic expectations of a player who is not used to that aspect of the game as much as others. He wasn't actually all that bad going forward for Torino either from what I read, but clearly it's not good enough for us at the moment. 
Varela has got to be first choice next season, and then Darmian. If someone like Mourinho comes in, I expect TFM to probably take that slot. Either him or Darmian.

1027~~~
The truth is actually the opposite. Last season and this season he has been pretty good at right back, much better than the majority of the caf says he has been. The reason for this is they can't forget his performances in the couple of years before.

1028~~~
He still can't defend, I don't get why people think he's a top full back when he clearly has no positional sense or anticipation. He offers pace and width and puts people on the back foot, so in other words he does Mata's job for him. I think Valencia's effectiveness says more about our RW than RB position.

1029~~~
wait what? are people arguing if he had a good game? 
Do you guys not remeber that mini spell of Villa's consecutive chances started with Tony getting skinned in the first place. A simple turn was enough to beat him. Half decent winger, poor defender these days.

1030~~~
This is the kind of nonsense that needs to stop. Valencia has lots of faults (And he's a bit shite himself tbf) but he's still miles better than Darmian which says a lot about how utterly shite Darmian is. How in the world of feck was that a golden opportunity? The ball is over his head and he has 2 defenders converging ahead of him. Good touch and layoff to Rooney in my book. And aside from his assist (why would you ignore that?) his movement going forward was excellent.

Darmian is horrific defensively and going forward. He'd behind Varela, Valencia, Young and every other half decent youngster in the youth squad in the pecking order. Shambles of a player. And less said the better about calamity Rojo.

1031~~~
Hes a good asset to help us going forward (as seen with his assist). The problem is how he manages to make the play come to standstill due to his inability to use a left foot, thus having to either go backwards or try and do a 360 spin to get it back to his right foot (you can kinda seen an element in the video posted above, where his first touch takes it away from goal, a left foot allows a cross, but as he has to use his right foot, its a pass back).

At fault for us almost conceding as well. A good team (or even a decent team) punishes us on the back of that.

Saying that, im happy hes back and is a decent squad player to have.

1032~~~
You are talking complete nonsense! You say I am talking like LVG! What does that mean? Rojo is one of the worst players I have ever seen at United. He looks like a centre back playing left back and when playing centre back looks like a left back. He is 50/50 whether he keeps the ball or not and a time bomb when defending. Darmain looks like an under 16 playing in an adult game. At least with Valencia who is not the greatest he doesn't get dominated (by fleet foot wingers) wtf he has to play against the same players as Darmain does. He works the ball well going forward yes he can't cross but neither can Darmain. So I have no idea about the rubbish you are spouting. You are clearly watching different players from me.

1033~~~
Spot on!

1034~~~
Much better than Darmian anyway.

1035~~~
Darmian horrific defensively ? I am sorry, but that is just plain wrong. On two ocassions, he saved us with crucial clearances in the season, moments where he ended up being injured because of that. He's the best I have seen this season at 1 v 1s. And he's tactically very sound. He's not great going forward, but like I mentioned before that was never his strong suit. No point complaining about him being rubbish in attacking when he's never been great at it throughout his career.

And Valencia is a squad player at best. He is woefully inept in defense (Though he has improved a lot since he first started out at RB). In attacking, all he cares about is not losing possession. He will protect that at all cost, fair play to him for that though. But defensively, it is a no contest between him and Darmian. In the same way, it's a no contest between those two in an attacking sense. It just depends on what you are looking for in that RB position on a game to game basis.

Rojo had a pretty decent season last year, which you might have forgotten. Yeah, I am not going to claim he's great or anything, since all I spoke about him was like one sentence, but you've made it more than that.

Since you have already agreed that Valencia and Darmian are both rubbish at crosses, I am going to leave it at that. Regarding your point that "Darmain looks like an under 16 playing in an adult game. At least with Valencia who is not the greatest he doesn't get dominated (by fleet foot wingers)" , I am just going to share some simple statistics to make my point.

I checked the duels section too and as expected Darmian was better in Defensive duels and Valencia in offensive one's. Same goes for attacking stats, Valencia was far ahead. Like I mentioned earlier, it's a simple case of how you want the team to set-up. If you are not going to expect much of a threat down your right hand side, case in point the Villa game, it makes sense to use Valencia. But if you want some Tactical solidity defensively, Darmian is the way to go. I personally prefer the former, but even then I would prefer someone like Varela being given that responsibility over Valencia. So I am not really watching a different game tbh, especially stats seem to back up what I have been saying all along.

1036~~~
But <a class="username" data-user="23979, @Lawman" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23979/">@Lawman</a>, you are right, Valencia sure loves keeping possession <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Edit: Darmian's attacking numbers were actually pretty decent for Torino in previous seasons, but yeah, it has become just non-existent at United.

1037~~~
What the actual feck? Darmain looks like someone who was a lucky loser in a contest to get into the United team. Horrific might have been an understatement if anything. He's been terrible defensively. At every aspect of defensive play in fact. It's only the new toy syndrome that's preventing the criticism towards him from being even worse.

You're right about Valencia being a squad player at best but when the other option is Darmian then he's got to be an unquestionable starter. I don't even like Valencia, who in an ideal world would have been sold long ago.

Rojo had a terrible season last time round as well. Just took some time for the new signing feel good factor to wear off before people realized just how shite he was. Definitely the worst defender I've seen at United.

1038~~~
There's no new toy syndrome for either of Darmian or Rojo. People are just the using that as a reason to damage them more than needed.  People are just over-reacting like crazy. If you go check squawka and compare those three players for the season, like expected Darmian wins most of the Defensive categories and Valencia the attacking one's. So how is it possible that what you are saying about Darmian being woeful defensively is not agreeing with actual statistics ?? That doesn't make sense to me. I agree he hasn't had a great debut season, but I do think he can get much much better. And confidence wise, he is shot. That's plain as day to anyone who sees him in a game. But to suggest Valencia is miles ahead is just plain wrong. They offer different things to a game. Personally, I still want to see Varela given more game time, and Valencia his back-up. But in tight tactical games against maybe Pep's City or Chelsea, Darmian to play at RB.

As for Rojo, again more over-reaction. He's not played much this season and there have been better LB's than him as well. But he was indeed very good last season except for the moments of madness he produced every now and then. Again, like Valencia, he's a good squad player to have. Once Shaw returns, that's exactly what he will be as well. So I don't see the point in castigating him so much and going as as far as calling him the worst defender to have ever donned a United Jersey. His role is clearly defined once we have a full strength squad. Same an Valencia, same as Darmian.

1039~~~
@<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/ijazz17.97925/">Ijazz17</a> Your showing average per game. Bearing in mind how Darmian as started more games and Valencia has come of the bench in most games that skews the results quite severely.

1040~~~
I would rate the like this:

1v1 defending:
Valencia- 7
Darmian- 5

Positioning:
Valencia- 3
Darmian- 9

Attacking:
Valencia- 7
Darmian- 3


And I think Valencia's positioning is bad enough that I'd prefer Darmian for most games.
FWIW, I'd give Rafael 7s in all 3 categories, making him comfortably better than both overall.

1041~~~
You're just being overly negative now. Darmian, at his best, is quite an accomplished defender. Good anticipation, good in the air and tackle, and strong one-vs-one. He's just looked bereft of confidence for most of the season, and that's likely something to do with LvG -- or perhaps he's just not mentally strong enough.

And neither Rojo or Darmian were worse than Alex Buttner.

1042~~~
That's why I showed average per game. Coz showing the total numbers was useless and I am not quite sure how the 90 min metrics thing works. So Average is the best qualifier for such a comparison. I agree that Valencia has had most games as a sub. But by that point games are usually already won or lost. I just felt this was the best way to represent the numbers.

1043~~~
I think you are being a little generous with Darmian for his attacking. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>. He's been pretty woeful all season long. 
Agree about Rafael though <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

Yeah, his confidence is rock bottom from what I observed. van Gaaled I guess.

1044~~~
Because statistics are everything are they?<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> 

The bit about wanting him to play him in big games is close to having me in stitches. Has awful positioning, is a complete fanny and makes so many mistakes. The idea that he is "tactically good" (I'm not even sure what this actually means) is positively hilarious. 

It's not an over reaction. He is genuinely that terrible. No idea why we would have him even as a squad player when we already have so many better players. He's unfit half the time and shit all the time.

At his best? Maybe in Italy but he's shown none of those supposed qualities here.

Buttner was a better player than Rojo and didn't cost four times the money either.

1045~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Buttner was just terrible. Rojo is shit, but Buttner was in an entirely different level of shitness. 

You will eat your words about Darmian next season, once we'll have a non clueless manager in charge.

1046~~~
I thought this was an anti-Valencia post. His fans on this forum used to use tackles/min to show what a world-class defender he is. And you're saying Darmian's positioning is bad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1047~~~
Buttner was the worst fullback I've seen, including all the random youngsters we've played this season. And Darren Fletcher. And Ryan Giggs. 
The only comparison I can find is Chimbonda in the Blackburn 7-1 game when Nani could choose which side he wanted to get past him every single time.

1048~~~
Rojo is the comfortably the worst defender I've seen at United.

He may do that. Doesn't change the fact he's had an abomination of a season.

1049~~~
I don't care for Valencia either. Ideally we'll go out and buy a proper new RB who's not totally shite but until we do that Valencia should be ahead of Darmian and it's not even close.

1050~~~
They definitely aren't. But in cases where people disagree on something despite pretty much watching the exact same match or matches, they are an excellent tool to make a point.

Really can't do anything if you are going to rate Tony V as a better defender than Darmian. Just going to use the same old phrase I have used endless times here . <i>Agree to disagree</i>.

1051~~~
Indeed. He looked good at the start of the season but it's swiftly gone down hill after that. 

He's showed them in glimpses here. At the start of the season -- he was very good against Tottenham at home, for example. He's in a new league, new country, and playing under a slightly autistic manager. Lots of change there. I think he'll be much better next season, especially if we get a new manager. Mourinho would love him I'm sure. 

Buttner was an absolute bag of shit. There's a reason all the posters here are disagreeing with you on that one, and there's a reason he's never even been capped for, possibly, the worst Netherlands team in history. He's quickish and can whip a good cross in once in a while. Other than that, he's completely hopeless: can't defend, can't head, can't dribble, and he's rash. Rojo might not have been worth the money, and I'm actually not really a fan of his, but he's a far superior player and defender to Alex fecking Buttner. Jesus.

1052~~~
Valencia gets a lot of stick from United fans but I don't think he's that bad. I would start him at RB over Darmian any day of the week.

1053~~~
I can understand why Valencia splits opinion, it's easy to see his limitations and likewise for his strengths. 

I'm surprised how people can not like him though, he's the epitamy of a no bullshit club player.

1054~~~
Don't really care.

Rojo is absolutely shite at everything. At least Buttner knew he was shite and cost a pittance. Rojo think he's Messi with the ball the way he tries to pass it (to the opposition) while being tragically unfit 90% of the time. Not to mention the tragically terrible deal that brought him here in the first place.

1057~~~
You see why I made the thread now!

1058~~~
Think that's lost on him!

1059~~~
So you are agreeing on stats this season you're comparing apples and pears?

1060~~~
The way I see Valencia is a failed winger converted to a poor/average RB BUT on the other hand he is a hardworking athlete with a good attitude.

1061~~~
Eh. I showed those stats to prove to you and Akash that Darmian is better defensively than you both seem to think. I never contested the fact that Valencia is better in attack compared to him. But your foundation for suggesting why Valencia should be ahead of Darmian predicated on the fact that Valencia keeps the ball well. As I showed in the second info-graph, that he does. But it seems to be all that he does. Coz if you look at other statistics like forward passes, pass completion rates, chances created, other attributes that show their attacking intent, those two players are not miles apart. To even my own surprise, there were a couple of stats, where Rojo was numerically better than both of them in an attacking sense. :|

Just goes to show you how poor that RB spot has been this season.

1062~~~
Valencia has had 9 appearances! He is visibly better regardless what the stats say. Darmain has been very poor and Rojo shockingly poor!

1063~~~
Why on earth he doesn't want to score? Two great situations in two games and he REFUSES to even look for a goal, for me that kind of mentality is really bad. Cofidence issues or not, you need to at least try to score when you are in good situation.

1064~~~
Has to be the most technically limited player in the league. He has no control with his right foot and he has no left foot. He has half the technique of a regular bad player. Good thing he's strong, quick and runs around a lot.

1065~~~
He's been brilliant.

1066~~~
Have to say he's pretty underrated by our fans. He's pretty good!

1067~~~
Best i've seen him play for years!

1068~~~
You obviously don't watch a lot of the league. There's at least ten worse than him on the pitch tonight alone.

1069~~~
Very good game from him tonight

1070~~~
He has one of the best first touches at the club!

1071~~~
Beast mode the difference with Him and Rojo or Darmain is stark

1072~~~
Very impressing tonight. We critize when players play bad, so we ought to do the opposite as well. Good game Tony.

1073~~~
True, but far too often overlooked. Really good today.

1074~~~
Excellent attacking display. Was very direct with his dribbling, brought the ball forward numerous times, made lots of good runs which were met with good crisp passes. His floated crosses are still a little underwhelming. But a solid combo between him and Lingard on that right side. Something that's been pretty vacant for the season.

1075~~~
I never thought I'd be writing an eight letter word for him starting with "Terri" and not being Terrible. VAlencia was Terrific. Best performance I've seen from him in years

1076~~~
I thought it was one of the few times he seems to have enjoyed playing football since his injury and the death of his mate.. tonight he was back to his early days at united where he was running at people instead of looking for the first sideways or backwards pass possible. He has always had a good relationship with Rooney - and there were a few signs of that in both halves. Nice to see him back to his old self

1077~~~
Was my man of the match.

1078~~~
It looked like United finally have some sort of wings.

It's a proper comeback after injury with that kind of performances. Well done.

1079~~~
Beasted up and down the right all evening.

1080~~~
If you put Young on the right wing ahead of Lingard, the combo with Valencia could be quite good.

1081~~~
Give him space to run into and he's a threat.

1082~~~
Really good display from him. 

Thats the kind of positivity we've been missing from RB. Good to have him back.

1083~~~
He's been missed against the shit teams especially, always willing to provide numbers in attack and being a nuisance on the overlap.

His passing is pretty underrated.

1084~~~
Good to see he's finally getting recognition. Right back is not a problem area for us.

1085~~~
Yeah, that felt like the Valencia of old!
Crossing was still rubbish though, but his best performance in a long long time (I think the last time I remember him being this good was in that UCL where he had that swollen eye and kept on playing).

1086~~~
Imagine if Valencia suddenly turned back into the machine from 2011 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1087~~~
Was his crossing rubbish though? He made a couple clever passes inside the box as well as a couple of decent crosses. Not many fullbacks deliver much more than that during a game. 

Is it just me, or did he actually look faster as the game progressed? He did look a little tired at the end, understandably.

1088~~~
Naturally I am feeling a little bit smug at the moment.

1089~~~
Is that a natural state of mind of yours, or simply a reaction to something having to do with Valencia?

1090~~~
Erm, it is, just because he had very good game against team that finished their season earlier doesn't mean he is always like this. Plus, he is 31. and looks to have more injury problems lately, we definitely need a new RB.

1091~~~
Well, a pass isn't exactly a cross right ? 
I meant the proper floaty crosses he tried in the second half were mostly overhit. But then again, the commentators kept saying that were weren't too many United players in the box. 
Don't think he was faster. He was just not tightly marked and pretty much allowed to run into space. When he's direct with his dribbling, he's always quick.

1092~~~
Is it me or it seems he is in the track of getting back to his glory days again, he looks very dangerous when going forward power, speed and strength just exactly what we need. Two very good performances! I would like to see him once more play as a right winger before end of season if it is possible.

1093~~~
Not many players who can bounce back into fighting shape so quickly (and regularly) after long lay-offs. Model athlete.

1094~~~
To be honest, there weren't enough United players in the box and even our first goal sums it up. If you look at Sir Alex days we used a lot of crosses and we manage to score a lot of them due to the number of United players in the box.

1095~~~
He's played better in these last two games than he has done for the last two years thats for sure. It's when he plays up against talented sides with good wingers that worries me, traditionally his positioning is all over the place.

1096~~~
Yeah, but Valencia only really started making those crosses when Fellaini was brought on. When he came on there were comfortably quite a few players in the box. But before that, it used to be just Rashford with the rest lurking around. Not sure I had see that in previous games though, coz there always used to be 2-3 players in the box. van Gaal must have been wary of a counter and hence tweaked the tactics a little.

1097~~~
Most of the games this season I have seen only 0-2 players in the box. Crossing is becoming useless if there are not enough players in the box. Even 3 sometime isn't enough. To me it should be 4 if we are going to rely on crossing.

1098~~~
As always very consistent, for all the hate he gets i still think hes a really good RB and every bit as good as most in the league. Very fast, very strong with brilliant energy. Product could be better but he stretches the game and opens pockets for others to move into.

1099~~~
People just didn't appreciate what he brought to the table. It's only now other fullbacks have struggled to bring the consistency, pace and power that he has that people are recognising what a useful player he is.

1100~~~
The moment we start doing something like that, before you know it, this forum will be filled with David Moyes and his 62 crosses against Fulham. 
I'd rather not see that. I like our wingers/forward to have those little exchanges around the penalty area before threading a ball behind enemy lines or getting it the byline before drilling a low cross in. You don't need more than 2-3 and maybe a late entrant into the box for that sort of play. 

Even an early cross like the beauty Rooney provided can be really effective with the right sort of run made.

1101~~~
62 crosses against Fulham was over relying on cross. Sir Alex rely on crossing a lot at his days and we always had 3-4 players in the box which make the crossing effective. And it's not like crossing is the only option but what's the point crossing the ball if there are not enough players in the box, giving a less chance to get it on target and the opposition defenders will just easily clear it away.

1102~~~
Hes needed against teams like this due to the way he injects pace into the team. Have no issue with him being a squad player next season and used for situations like this especially at home.

1103~~~
He seemed to be a bit more daring in attacking his man and actually trying to take them on tonight. That coupled with his usual work rate (basically running the entire right flank on his own) made him my MOTM.

It's been a long time since I have even considered him for such an accolade. 

He is definitely our best option at RB if Mata is playing RW but I just wish he would trust his left foot for basic five yard passes rather than contorting his entire body to hit it awkwardly with his right.

1104~~~
Yeah, Ideally a mix up of play is best. But even in SAF's days I remember so many CL goals scored with basically just the one striker in the box. It's nothing new. It's just about the execution. Valencia I don't think can hit a moving ball with a vicious curve or any degree of accuracy. I do think he's decent at crossing when the ball is at a standstill though. Obviously having 3-4 players improves your teams chances, but like I said, I think van Gaal probably made a tactical tweak to prevent a counter since I remember we had bodies in the box for the Villa and West Ham game.

1105~~~
Perfectly fine as a complementary player but with our limited attack, he doesn't have the defensive skills needed to be our #1 RB. I do wish he'd do a better job of picking out a target, whether it be a man or empty space for trailing runners to attack. The likes of Rooney and Mata could/should be running onto crosses like that if they're playing further back.

1106~~~
You are very right. Also, his short passing and first touch are excellent.

1107~~~
I don't know what kind of 'many CL goals' you watched but SAF loves to play 442 so it's surprised me to see someone think that we scored so many CL goals from crossing when we only had one striker in the box.

What's the point prevent a counter attack by reducing players in the box from crossing chance if at the end they still can launch a counter attack because their defenders clear the ball away.

1108~~~
I've always liked valencia <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1109~~~
Erm, it's not really. We also have darmian, varela and TFM (talent) that can fill the void

1110~~~
Plenty. Especially in the three years we got to the finals, we usually used to play 4-5-1 (or whatever iteration of it you wish to call it) away from home and most of the time it used to be a lone Tevez/Rooney etc in the box with late runners or wide players coming in. We never used to play 4-4-2 in those important CL games away from home. And I needn't tell you how important those away goals were.

Erm, if they clear the ball long to someone like Adebayor who is pretty decent at holing up the ball, he can easily lay it off for someone Like Zaha or the other winger (Don't even know who it was tbh), and counter. The point would be for someone besides Schneiderlin especially Rooney to cover in such cases. Moreover, the average positions our full backs took up was very high, so a counter was very much on the cards.
Besides, all of this is really moot. We din't really play a crossing game in the first half. We obviously used the width the full backs provided to get to the byline and then looked for passes for the late runners or tried to play intricate stuff around those areas.
It was only after Fellaini came on that we tried more crosses.

1111~~~
Darmian is shit, Varela doesn't look anything special either and TFM played around 3 games.

1112~~~
Darmian isn't "shit" he's struggled often in his first season in a difficult league. I guarantee you tfm will be a quality player. Varela is also potentially a very good right back. I don't remember a right back needing to be special, look at Danny Simpson he's in a team winning the league

1113~~~
Darmian is shit, I am not sure even Büttner was poor as him. Just because it's his first season doesn't mean he'll be much better next season.

1114~~~
Well shit mate I don't think a player starting for United and Italy is "shit". The guy is a quality defensive player. Just needs to find the form of early season where he was immense. Also captained he's last team I believe

1115~~~
One bad season also doesn't mean he'll stay shit.

1116~~~
There was no "form". He had about 4 good games and then it went down hill fast. 

Even those good games were overplayed by a combination of hope and confirmation bias.

1117~~~
Since when is 4 good games not good form? And I disagree he was very very good at a time  we were conceding no goals as well. He's attack is often disappointing for sure but he's a defender first and foremost I don't expect him to be brilliant on the ball.

Off season should be all about crossing form him

1118~~~
Would be the best winger in the league

1119~~~
But doesn't bode well when he's been that shite

1120~~~
Who is the best right winger, Mahrez? There aren't many good candidates - that's for sure.

1121~~~
He is fresh the rest of the league has played a full season he will look good on the pitch the remainder of the season.

1122~~~
Probably Sanchez at Arsenal or DB at City.

1123~~~
He's been dire for a good while but he's come back well. Much of it is in his head. If he's brave and continues to attack players then he will be better for it.

1124~~~
I really hope he can improve, but honestly there is so much things he needs to improve that I simply can't see it happening. He showed that he can be good defensively at times but the consistency was the problem. But his attacking abilities will never be good, he won't become quick, good crosser and improve his technique in general even when he hits some good form.

1125~~~
Sanchez mostly plays lw,no? There aren't many great rws out there though

1126~~~
I reckon having the screws taken out of his ankle will contribute to some resurgence of form.

1127~~~
Alexis has been fantastic at right-wing recently for Arsenal. Obviously Mahrez has overall had a great season there too, and Lamela/Deulofeu/Willian've been decent. Don't really think the others are worth mentioning.

1128~~~

</ul>

1129~~~
He looked good for the majority of last season,where he was basically our first choice RB.

1130~~~
Bullshit he's not playing.

1131~~~
Our best right back at the club by a mile.

1132~~~
Certainly should be shifting TFM to the left and playing Valencia over Rojo.

1133~~~
Lvg is fecking nuts.

1134~~~
Got skinned by Cleverly but made up for it minutes later with a fantastic tackle on Cleverly on that centering ball. Beast mode lite, immediately gave us width and an attack from the right side. Solid match. Undoubtedly should be our first choice right back.

1135~~~
Made an impact in giving us an out ball and got up to the pace of a pretty frantic second half in double time.

1136~~~
This 

But I still have reservations about his future here. He is way too limited. He is fine when the going gets rough but otherwise I think his future should lie elsewhere

1137~~~
I think he'll be ok for another season here given we have other areas that need more attention this summer and I don't think another 6 or 7 player overhaul is the way to go, but the summer after we need to finally nail down a long term RB.

1138~~~
Our only proper fullback who can bring the ball forward and send crosses in.

1139~~~
Who gets skinned by Cleverley? Really? Cab someone please show him how to cross as well? Put a bit of pace on the bloody thing.

1140~~~
I agree but I fear that another injury would set the club back further. I'd rather we take our chances with Darmian and Varela and build on them. The club is riddled with too many "makeshift" players like Young, Valencia, Rooney, Fellaini and even Blind, albeit harsh in this context; players who have declined or not excelled in their natural positions and are being moved about to compensate for injuries, in the name of experience. Valencia will never be a RB but just a player that can do a job, which is ok for the level we are at but not what we should be aiming for.

1141~~~
Is leaving 20 acres of space for an opponent and turning away (I guess to look for a manual on playing football) considered getting skinned?

He gave us a fresh pair of legs and helped us in the final third but he is a defensive liability.  TFM would've easily seen out the 90 if he didn't get charged with the penalty.

1142~~~
Surprised he didnt start as RB.

I think hes a good outlet to have when were struggling to breakdown teams due to the width and pace he brings on the right.

1143~~~
His crosses aren't crosses, he just chips the ball diagonally/backwards.

1144~~~
...which have led to a lot of goals over the past 4-5 years.

1145~~~
He's the kind of player that I can see the many a manager liking. 

Doubt he'll be anywhere but Old Trafford next season .

1146~~~
Yeah, 8 assists in last 3 years! Lot of goals...

1147~~~
I said 4-5 years for a reason.  But reading may not be your strength.

1148~~~
Last 3 seasons are more important because they show he has obviously lost it. What happened 4 or 5 years ago doesn't mean he is still the same player, but even if you count just his best seasons his assists stats weren't <i>that </i>impressive either<i>. </i>But I understand people love to live in the past where Valencia is still some excellent winger and attacking outlet.

53 assists in 243 games(17334 minutes) for us, assist every 327 minutes is far from some impressive assist record. Even Ashley Young has better assists stats for us and he hardly played under Fergie when we used to score goals that improve Valencia's stats.

Everyone know that his crossing in last 4 seasons is embarrassing for a Manchester United player but you somehow use it as some positive about him.

1149~~~
Thankfully football isn't a sport based solely on statistics. He should stay and play until we have somebody better than him.

1150~~~
No one is saying it is, I was just answering to his "we have scored lot of goals from Valencia's crossing in last 4-5 years". I think Valencia should be starter for us anyway since Darmian is nowhere near good enough, at least this season.

1151~~~
Dani Alves has an assist every 326.76 according to whoscored.

1152~~~
It was pretty horrible <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I chalk it down to only just coming on though, always takes a few minutes to get used to the pace of a match like that. Once he got up to speed he was fine.

1153~~~
It's possible since he is a fullback his entire career.

Valencia's record as a fullback(last two seasons) is assist every 743 minutes.

Edit: actually, screw that, his all 3 assists last season came when he was playing as a winger. His assists vs Villa was his only assist as a fullback in last two seasons.

1154~~~
It's easier to assist Messi, Suarez and Neymar though.

1155~~~
Of course, but he is nowhere near as good as Alves, nor he would have any more assists than him playing for Barcelona. Do you see him assisting so many Messi's goals the way Alves did?

1156~~~
Probably not but given we're talking about one of the best attacking defenders around playing with the best attackers it's fair to point out assist stats are not a good way to judge a player playing at full back.

1157~~~
So you think his crossing is good?

1158~~~
Not particularly. Even at his best I don't think it was very good. He's a good player though and one who still attracts undue criticism despite the evidence of how much worse you can get in that position.

1159~~~
I agree that he is our best option on the right fullbck by far, I was just criticising his crossing.

1160~~~
I will let your own quotes show you how badly you are distorting arguments to make your own point.  Nobody denies he had a couple very bad seasons.  And the topic of whether his crosses are good is subjective - what player is universally considered a great and consistent crosser?  

53 goals is a lot of goals.  And your statistics probably don't include CL and Cups which I bet you would get the number closer to 75.

1161~~~
Nah his current "method" of crossing isn't what produced his assists five years ago. He'd still be knocking similar figures if that was the case.

Strikes me as a player who's developed a case of the yips. Bristow had it in darts, Hendry in snooker. They just can't release their arm/leg when they should. A delay kicks in.

He's lost some pace and with it confidence. Maybe that's affected his decision making.

1162~~~
It does include all competitions, 243 games. Assist every 5 games isn't great, especially because most of that came in in one season and because he can't score goals either. More than 1/4 out of his 53 assists came in 11/12 season, which was 4 years ago. 

As for his crosses, are you really gonna say that? He is not some good but inconsistent crosser, he is terrible crosser of the ball for years now. Absolutely terrible.

1163~~~
I really don't understand the level of criticism he gets. In games like today it's so obvious how influential he can be in putting us on the front foot with his drive, pace and direct threat 1v1.

1164~~~
I would have him over Darmian every day of the week.

1165~~~
He's better than Darmian for sure. The latter can probably defend better but it's a poor contribution if you can't provide support.

1166~~~
Best player for United today. Looks a lot slimmer than before

1167~~~
Good game, would be my first choice at right-back as things stand.

1168~~~
Good game. He bring the best balance.

1169~~~
If he had a left foot he would be a much much better footballer (and be appreciated more). Its a shame hes so reliant on his right foot to do anything (which at times results in the game being slowed down).
Saying that he did well with the outside of the foot cross. We need a somewhat equivalent of him on the left to help out in attacks.

I like him and think hes a good player to have for our squad next season anyway.

1170~~~
I just think that if it was him playing instead of Lingard, it would have made a difference. Fuchs is quite slow, but Lingard just doesn't have that edge. With the space offered on the right side, Valencia could challenge him instead of having to make 50 yard runs again and again. We desperately need a new right winger.

1171~~~
Would it be possible to maybe remove his foot and have it replaced by a frisbee?

1172~~~
It's ironic. If he was the opposing fullback Roney's crossfield passes would work a charm since he never manages to intercept (or even contest) a single long ball/cross.

1173~~~
He's been a big miss this year due to injuries, I know hes not popular on here, but hes a lot better at RB than Damien.

1174~~~
Good game from him.

1175~~~
Still looks like a tank.  Tony V played very well today.

1176~~~
Since getting the metal out of his ankle he's been much better. Very good game from him today.

1177~~~
Still a tank, just not an Abraham tank anymore, which may be a good thing. Very good today - a couple of good crosses, an assist and great first touch as always.

1178~~~
Gets a lot of criticism on here but one of few who can be pleased with their performance today.

1179~~~
feck me I am a better right back than Damien........

It's ok, I'll wait <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1180~~~
Another good shift from Tony and got an assist, his relentless overlapping on the right covers a bit for the fact we lack a player of Martial's caliber over there..

1181~~~
He was one of our best players today and is 100 times better than Darmian, but this game showed both sides of him. He was almost playing as a winger against a team which was pinned back and at times had only 20 % possession, and he only managed to create a single chance in the entire match that was a goal. Its criminal how much time he had a ball in two one one situation or all the time in the world to cross and he managed to mess it up. Compare this with Mahrez today with so little possession he still managed to terrorize us and create chances had a penalty shout turned down etc. This is the level of player we should be aiming at, and i can bet my house of it, if we had Mahrez and Leicester had Valencia we would have won the match comfortably.

1182~~~
You could see he was reluctant to do his usual one trick that gets him past a player simply because he knew he wouldn't be able to outpace them. He's losing his best asset- his pace.

1183~~~
Yet is still our best right back by a distance

1184~~~
His reluctance to even touch the ball with his left foot drives me mad. He will literally run in a circle or make a more difficult pass to avoid it.

1185~~~
I'm starting to wonder about that also. He never loses a foot race; the one against Clichy was almost epic, where Valencia was at a standstill had to turn with Clichy going at full pelt and Tony easily caught up with him and outmuscled him. It seems rather his acceleration is fading a little. Also,when he kicks the the ball past players, the touch often goes to the right making him having to run further than the opposing player.

As for out and out pace, he made Mahrez his bitch, easily.

1186~~~
The cross to Mata was a chance but unfortunately it was on Matas head.

1187~~~
Yes, agreed.

1188~~~
It is kinda like Rooney, who has lost his acceleration but once he gets going he can be fairly fast. Just that he can't maintain that for too long. Rooney is gradually losing his top speed too, the same will happen to Valencia and we may have to say goodbye to a loyal servant to the club. I think Varela should replace him personally- have not given up faith in him.

1189~~~
How many chances did Rojo create - or for that matter, how many chances would Darmian have created? And are you seriously comparing a RB with a RW who doesn't even track back?

1190~~~
I think he's looking like a decent player again. Very nice cross for the goal and good defensively. He wasted the ball a fair bit going forward but no more than you'd expect Darmian to.

Torn between wanting him to get a run of games and wanting Fosu-Mensah to get more chances. Given that we're playing for very little now I'd probably go for the latter.

1191~~~
Everyone says he is under-rated and unloved but this thread is the closest thing to a circlejerk other than the Martial and DDG threads. He had to face maybe 4 crosses into his zone today and managed to lose his man for 2 of them, and he often doesn't bother tracking back if caught high up(though he gets universal praise for his commitment). Maybe the latter is part of instructions (Lingard defends ok) and maybe he is asked to defend narrow from crosses -- but today apart from the trademark open space behind him (towards the touchline), he let Ulloa walk right in front of him too to connect with a cross.

1192~~~
Did well. Very good assist, but I still feel that he should be much more effective near the opponent's box, especially when he receives so much time and space like against Leicester.

Nahhhh...this was 5 months ago against Argentina.  Mind you, he's still probably not at 100% since his surgery.

1194~~~
I wrote last year in the unpopular opinions thread that 'unfortunately' Valencia will end the season as our first choice right back. Looks like that will be the case. Bit disappointing, Darmian looked so solid till the Arsenal game. But I'm happy to go into next season with Valencia, Darmian, TFM and Varela as our RB options.

1195~~~
Yeah Valencia is the least of our problems.. I am pretty sure the next manager will like him as well..

1196~~~
The only outfield player to look anywhere close to good.

1197~~~
The shirts untucked... he means business.

1198~~~
Good to have him back.

1199~~~
Beast. Always a player who gives it his all on the pitch. How can you not appreciate that. Good game today.

1200~~~
Our best right sided player. Still has a future here as a squad player or RB. He can't beat players anymore but is just solid and intelligent out there.

1201~~~
Love this guy.

1202~~~
The only criticism I have of him is the smashing the ball against defenders ankles.

But happy to have him back. Gives us a good outlet with his pace.

1203~~~
Did his best with no support on his flank for most of the game.

1204~~~
I'm a big critic of his and am amazed his still here, but since he's come back from his injury he's been our best player.

1205~~~
Was great today, has been solid since his return from injury.

His delivery was much improved today also. Very impressed with the lad.

1206~~~
His passing in general looks really good.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/r9cn" width="560"></iframe>

1207~~~
id say that was a poor pass helped by a cock up

1208~~~
Just such a good player to have around there is no way we should be getting rid of this guy.

1209~~~
Mr Reliable this season.

1210~~~
He's actually cut back on that a bit this season. He doesn't always smash it when closed down, like last season, but passes the ball back to the center more often. Every now and again he'd actually pretend to burst forward but then stop and cross it softly behind the defender. The entire last season has been just an act to seemingly make him predictable. Genius.

1211~~~
He was one of our best performers today, been really impressed with him since he's come back from injury. I hope whoever the manager is next season they'll keep him.

1212~~~
Thought he was in 'beast' mode today.

But watch people spout shit like he has been shit in 2 days though. People tend to forget good performances of players they dislike.

1213~~~
He's been solid at RB for awhile now.  Occasionally he lacks some positional sense, but his work rate, athleticism, strength, willingness to get forward and acceptable level of comfort on the ball for a defender is all at a solid level.

1214~~~
We have too many positions in need of upgrading to waste money on a RB when he is capable of performing to an acceptable standard. Him, Darmian and TFM give us solid options for that position.

1215~~~
He's done really well since he came back from injury.

1216~~~
Not the long term answer at RB (sure I said the same thing at this time 12 months ago to), but he was excellent today I thought. Now if only he could cross...

1217~~~
Crap positioning from him. Not a good right back, at all.

1218~~~
Fixed

1219~~~
He doesn't try to take risks.. drive forward when you have space.. not wait for support and pass backwards...

1220~~~
He had a sloppy but so did everyone first 10 minutes but he after that he was fine.

1221~~~
I'll give him something - He's always in space for those Rooney Hollywood balls.

1222~~~
I thought he was going to get sent off, he wasn't in the lower ranks of the worst tonight but wasn't very good either.

1223~~~
Was OK, like you said not his best performance but no where near the worst culprit.

1224~~~
I want to like the guy but is a liability in too many key moments

1225~~~
Going forward against teams who sit back hes a nice RB to have. But unfortunately he was naive today. The way he gave away the free kick at 2-2 (having seen us concede a goal from a free kick at 2-1) was madness.

1226~~~
His positioning as a fullback has always been poor, still is and it almost cost us several times tonight.

1227~~~
He's not good enough to be a RB and not good enough to be a RW. However I still think he's a great option at times.

Since he came back from injury I actually think he's been pretty good, but that says more about the level the rest of the team has been at really. He's so strong and quick though and he doesn't often give the ball away. He's risk free in attack but can be risky in defense.

1228~~~
He's fecking shit and should never play for United again.

1229~~~
Great assist today. I like how he is taking on players again - actually looks a lot faster off the mark.

1230~~~
Got forward well tonight and was one of our better attacking players.

1231~~~
I think he's been unreal since his injury comeback, his pace is just such an outlet on that right wing. The biggest issue is that his positioning is lacking to be a top fullback but he could still do a brilliant job in that role most of the time.

1232~~~
Good game today. Has done well recently.

1233~~~
There are people who think we should let him go - insane. Not many better RB in the league

1234~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1235~~~
You have to say, he has been brilliant since coming back from injury. Beastly in just about every game (didn't see the west ham game tbf but he had that pic next to Antonio which makes up for a poor game if he had one). Seem to remember him also playing really well in the bit of time he had before his injury, but he's been a huge loss for us. People are insane if they really want him gone. He's a huge asset on the right because of how good he gets forward, and he has improved a lot defensively speaking. The perfect Mourinho player too out on the right I think.

1236~~~
cant believe people praise him that much, he was decent and solid but apart that he is very average and from time to time prone to a basic mistake... he either has absolutely no vision or is scared to death to make a 5m pass forward, its completely annoying along with his one-footness. I'm not saying we should sell him as he's still valuable to us but should never be a first option, will b a big disappointment personally if we start season iwth Valencia and Darmian on the right next season..

1237~~~
Prepare yourself to be disappointed then, that's more than enough quality and cover for RB and I don't see any indication Utd don't feel the same way.

1238~~~
I disliked him a lot till last season, but he has changed my opinion of him. Has been very good since his comeback

1239~~~
His passing is really good though. He was promising tonight. His shot was a screamer, and not that many goalies would have saved it. His rubbish vision awarded Rashford with a golden chance, which he took - not every player would have the vision to see that pass, nor to make the run in the first place. But yeah... 
His one-footedness is a little annoying, but you must really hate Messi, Robben, Giggs etc too then? It's a label printed on him, but a lot of players are quite one footed.

1240~~~
Watched a documentary on him the other day. Seems harsh now to criticise when you see what he's achieved. What he's come from.

The problem I think is that there's no joy in his game. That doesn't mean he's useless. He's effective, great attitude, dependable but also incredibly flat. If a robot could play football.

He's lost some pace, power trudges through the ground when once he zipped along. If he'd have worked on his crossing, developed a delivery that wasn't smashed he'd be a much better fullback.

1241~~~
Assist King.

1242~~~
Seemed a lot more aggressive and confident today than I have seen him in what seems like years. Prepared to take a few risks, take players on and even having a crack from range - that is the sort of thing I want to see more of (if Valencia stays - and even then I would say RB is a position we should be seeking to improve in).

1243~~~
We've been really unfortunate not to have him available enough times this season.

1244~~~
I could only laugh when I saw him complete two of his trademark 360* spins before resorting to a desperation outside of the boot right-footed pass in the 1st half. I'm known (at the level of football I'm involved in) for being incredibly one-footed but Valencia seems like he'd rather die than attempt to do anything except stand up with his left foot.

PS. I love him. My other (RvP for life) favourite United player of the past 5 years.

1245~~~
Another great match with a fantastic assist. The swag is back. I can only imagine how many points more we would´ve had had Valencia and Shaw been available all year, not too mention the boost they would`ve given our languid attack. 6 points is not unreasonable to imagine. Maybe best of all it would´ve kept the atrocious liability/zero offense joke Darmian off the pitch which would´ve resulted in another few points.

On his day, he is probably the best right back in the PL, at least from this year.

1246~~~
Everything needed for a modern day full back, especially in our slow build up play, where he gives us the drive to make things happen. With a defensive midfielder to drop in and make a three at the back - similar to Dier at Spurs, Valencia and Shaw in full back positions can have the license to bomb forward at will.

1247~~~
I really like him since he's turned into a full back.

1248~~~
Would have loved that shot to go in, he hit it with some power. But good save from the keeper

1249~~~
He was great today. Didn't realise he had that touch over his shoulder in his locker. Good energy too, given how long he's been out. 

No question about keeping him in the frame for next year. Hopefully he can actually stay fit.

1250~~~
His first touch always good. So many times Scholes delivered the ball from long distance and he took it down easily.

1251~~~
He will have his work cut out for him this weekend. Zaha has pace, power and trickery. I want Young on the right to help Antonio out but it will be Lingard.

1252~~~
Had a good game but he's shit, really. He has stopped so many attacks, slowed down the play and passes back way too often. Not to mention he smashes the ball into the ground that 99.9% of the time goes no where. Nice guy, shit winger/fullback.

1253~~~
I can't really see a difference between his performances now and the ones last season. He was good last season and he is good now, just others perception has changed of him because of other right backs not trouncing over him like everyone thought they would. Not only were they not trouncing him, they were worse, i.e. Darmain (an actual right back)

1254~~~
Miles better than Darmian in every way.

1255~~~
how can you compare Messi, Robben and Giggs and their one-footedness? it's completely different, they can still pass the ball with their left or use it to do something for Valencia it's just for leaning, he's been zillion times in situation where if he used his left leg he would start a nice counter or a nice combination but he slows so many attacks down which drives me crazy, one cut back pass with his head doesnt mean he's vision and if he had one it doesn't really matter when he plays like robot which never takes risks and can't thread through simple 5m pass.. 

as for his shooting who cares how good he's in that when he let fly maybe 4 times in his whole Unite career... he's a useful squad player and good rotation option for next season but should never start, people got used to really low level performances from Darmian and inconsistent Varela so all of a sudden they praise Valencia who wasn't anything special and yeah had a good game against 15th placed Bmouth who were on holiday...

1256~~~
Doesn't say much. Darmian has been very poor.

I'd ship Valencia off, this summer. He's not good enough anywhere but full back, where he's pretty average, as it is.

1257~~~
I agree

1258~~~
That's a tired cliché carried over from his last year as a right winger. I doubt he passes backwards anymore than other RB's in the league. He put in a good ball through for Rashford in the first half and put the long ball in for Rooney vs Norwich which we scored from so people saying he can't pass is nonsense. And to just tarnish him as shit rather than average is hypercritical.

1259~~~
I think with him and Darmian we have solid RBs that offer us different aspects one is better going forward and one is better defending. I like that balance. Yes I know Darmian has been shit buy I still believe he'll improve next season.

1260~~~
No contest there.

1261~~~
Valencia should have been sold a couple of years ago but right now there's zero justification in selling him when he's our best RB. The fact that it doesn't say much is an entirely different debate.

1262~~~
No, it's not another debate. He's our best because the rest aren't very good. Keeping him here does us no favours.

Give Darmian another year, sell Valencia, and promote Varela. If Darmian continues to be shit, ship him out next season. There's no point in keeping shit players for the sake of it.

1263~~~
Darmian will never reach his level.

1264~~~
It'll be Bolasie. Zaha plays on the right most the time unless Bolasie doesn't play. 

Anyway I don't worry about Valencia in that sense, he's quick and strong in 1v1 situations he usually fairs pretty well. It's off the ball concentration and high crossfield balls he struggles with. 
Hopefully though we can keep Palace pushed back, let them do the chasing.

1265~~~
Darmian is already close to being as useless as Valencia.

I have faith in Darmian, he's shown to be somewhat competent, unlike Valencia who's atrocious at right back.

1266~~~
And you know this because? And out of curiosity, what is this level that you speak of? It seems that you have concluded on a player after a few months under LVG where the whole team was crap.
Darmian was highly sought before we bought him, I'm not sure if other clubs hold Valencia in that regard. Darmian's best performances at RB will overshadow Valencia's at RB.

1267~~~
Confirmation bias at work. Or you literally don't have a scooby doo about football.

1268~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So let me get this straight.

We sell our best RB in the hope that the RB who has been beyond shite may reach Valencia's level, a level you have already described as atrocious.

So, it is another debate altogether. Valencia is our best RB so logically speaking he should be bottom of the list of RB's we should be looking to sell.

1269~~~
Conversely, it could be you that doesn't have a shaggy about football?

Valencia is and has been average, at best, for the last three years.

1270~~~
No, Valencia is 32/33 and not going to get any better. He's also not very good, so why on earth should we keep him? Because he's been the least worst of the lot?

1271~~~
Seems like a very convincing reason to me given Darmian is either dogshite or injured or generally both when he plays.

1272~~~
I would rather keep Valencia than Darmian. Darmian has been as big a disappointment as Memphis for me and I think that with both those players if we sell them this summer we should make most of our money back (as we did with Di Maria). 

I've seen quite a few posts recently about how Mourinho would like Darmian but I don't see it at all. Mourinho places much more emphasis on athleticism than Van Gaal does and Darmian is simply much slower and weaker than even a 30 year old Valencia.

1273~~~
This thread makes me wonder if i'm watching a different game when there are still people suggesting Darmian over Valencia.

1274~~~
Valencia symbolizes the main thing that was alright in Fergie's era and evaporated after him. Namely the appliance and determination of player, his work-rate. First of all, don't get me wrong, that was not a main thing, of course even SAF would not won anything big with 11 valencias. But his nous for a player that would really be working hard was great.
You look at Valencia and he is not a good player, like properly good. He is average, maybe just a tad above. But he does not sulk, he is ready to fill different positions, roles. He managed to rediscover himself at the RB position. In the same manner as players like Fletch, Park, OShea rediscovered themselves. Valencia might lack a true ability or skill, the kind that gives you a starting spot in the top team, but when he plays, you can feel he does value being here at United.
Sadly i don't even have a whiff of that when i see Darmian play, or Bastain, Morgan, especially Depay and Rojo. Same thing was with other failed transfers, Di Maria and Falcao. Some of them are much better players, but ti put simply they don't really give a $hit and Valencia does. While it's important to have players with superior ability, i think it's also important for us to regain this "foundation" of sorts, lost after Fergie retired. This work ethic and to have players that actually appreciated being here, not the one that are here cause it was a good opportunity to develop career or get a last pay check or whatever.

So i'd like to keep him in the squad.

1275~~~
^
Getting rid of Valencia in this transition period would be silly. He is 30 yes, but look at Ibra and Ronaldo. Both are above 30 and they are proper professionals who take care of their bodies. Clearly Val does the same given that he came back really well despite a lengthy spell out. Even Suarez is 29, Messi is 28 and they're still going strong.

1276~~~
Innocent question mate, what right backs do you think are better than Valencia in the premier league currently?

It's not a leading question, just curious as to just how badly you rate him.

1277~~~
Valencia is badly underrated at RB, his concentration can be suspect but he's one of the best 1v1 defenders in the league due to his superior strength and pace. I honestly don't think there's many better RBs in the league than Valencia tbh.

1278~~~
Actually apart from Arsenal's Bellerin i, personally, don't know if i want anyone else. I mean i think Zabaleta is better over the last couple of years, but i feel that he is regressing at much faster paste because of his injuries. And Walker, Clyne, Sagna i don't think they are better at RB.
Of course Walker and Clyne being 4-5 years younger can raise their game a bit.

1279~~~
30 is hardly much for a proper athlete like Valencia. He looks a tad slower on the first five yards, but his top speed would still challenge Bale. I also think that he looks faster after removing the metal in his foot. Most sprinters break their own speed records past the age of thirty. Footballers are just lazy athletes that don't take care of their body like they should; something tells me that Valencia, on the other hand, does take care of himself. Has he ever lost a footrace?

1280~~~
Has been one of our best players over the last month alongside tony M, sign up all the tony's

1281~~~
Once he gets going he is so fast it's unreal. And his stamina is still just as good as it used to be maybe even better. He is a great professional who really take cares of his body. He could essentially be like Evra, sprinting up and down the flanks all game into his 30s.

1282~~~
Valencia is 30. d.o.b. 4 August 1985

1283~~~
The RB position is alright for next year. Give Valencia, Darmian and Varela all game time and let them show what they can do.

1284~~~
For me its Valencia as first choice by an absolutely huge margin, I still really rated him last season when he was getting slated because people were expecting winger performances from him while playing at full back. At the minute he seems to have a spring in his step so hopefully he starts the game on Saturday, the other fullback is the much bigger issue.

1285~~~
I can't understand why he isn't used at RW anymore - he's still very effective attacking wise and a better option than Lingard imo.

1286~~~
I've wondered this also. He is a better option than Lingard, but Lingard seems to have more goals in him. Valencia provides much more width though, which would create a lot more space for Mata in the middle. Lingard is all over the place in that respect. With Lingard and Martial on the flanks, we have nobody who keeps the width, which keeps the opposing fullbacks busy.

1287~~~
Aye he's our best RB by a country mile, both defensive and offensively, if nothing else he offers us more width consistently,
He lacks a bit of defensive awareness, but he can usually make up for it with his strength and pace.
He's not popular on here, but he's been a big miss for us this season I think, Damien has been shite.

1288~~~
Shame he's not been fit for most of the season could have used the width.

1289~~~
I've always found it quite weird that Valencia hasn't been used as a RCM in United. He plays in midfield for Ecuador and always looks right at home.
His close technique is surprisingly good, his passing is excellent, his engine is unreal and he is built like a freaking tank. In a three-man midfield with say Herrera and Schneiderlin, I think he would thrive.

1290~~~

1291~~~
He had that one game vs Everton where he was very good there but never been used there since.

1292~~~
I know, which makes it even weirder. I love the man to bits, and hope the club keeps him.
When he signed for United, he fired his agent because this was where he wanted to be for the rest of his career. As a supporter that is something that makes me love him, even when things aren't going his way.

1293~~~
What a guy. Gives away the most pointless of freekicks to start the attack.

1294~~~
You are seriosuly blaming him for the goal? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1295~~~
Really?

1296~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1297~~~
Its funny cause hes absolutely shit. He has no idea how to attack. Should have been busting a gut to get forward in our last attack but he doesnt anticipate anything. Pure average.

1298~~~
Eh, he's played a big hand in the 2 times we hit the wood work and just played another big hand in our goal.

1299~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great timing mate.

1300~~~
Unsung hero of our squad

1301~~~
He's excellent.

1302~~~
Him and Rooney have been explempary attitude wise.

1303~~~
Defiantly.

1304~~~
MOTM for me.

1305~~~
Man of the match easily!

1306~~~
Can even play 180 minutes with the same energy! MOTM

1307~~~
Hahahaha

1308~~~
Yeah, he was a constant threat. Rolled back the years a bit.

1309~~~
MOTM for me too (for us).

1310~~~
Me too and I'm delighted to come back to this thread to see I'm not the only one

Not a foot wrong while game

1311~~~
Agreed. Best player on the pitch for us

1312~~~
Brilliant today - and that was before his run at the end - really made a difference and I had no idea what that poster was on about.

With Lingards goal - brilliant burst, especially considering the time of the game.

1313~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1314~~~
Great today

1315~~~
7th season at United and always giving it his best. Well done Antonio.

1316~~~
Just embarrassing comments all round.

Criticize him when plays poorly,but this agenda driven nonsense is just tiring. 

It's like some posters have a thing against some of our players,and will manufacture faults just to fit whatever narrative they hold.

1317~~~
Never stopped coming at them the whole game, good shift.

1318~~~
I don't have an agenda. Throwing around the embarrassing comment phrase whenever some disagrees with someone else is tiresome. 

I've barely made many posts in this thread, albeit most are negative, but that happens to be my opinion of the guy. I don't think he's very good.

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

1319~~~
Anyone noticed how LVG basically told Giggsy 4-4-1, and then when we restarted, it was basically 4-3-2 with Tony V manning the entire right flank by himself?

I think he's slowed down a lot from the injuries, but boy does his engine ever run out of gas? Up and down the right flank for 180 minutes and never a single step off the pace.

1320~~~
Very good today I've always liked him and still think he's actual more than capable as a winger. He's one of the few in the team you can bank of to be mentally tough also.

1321~~~
When it easily clouds your judgement when everyone else realises he's got a good game just speaks to how you choose to simply see what isn't there. 

But you are entitled to your own opinion  I suppose. The great thing about most of our maligned players is how they don't really give a feck and just continue to perform.

1322~~~
I've adored him for years. When people were calling for him to be sold over the last few years, I was in the pro-Valencia camp. It's taken him a while to find the form he showed pre-bad injury - but he's such a quality player to have when he's on form. The engine and the determination he has is fantastic. Dominated that right side today.

Him and Rooney were MOTMs.

1323~~~
I think Mourinho will like him. I hope so.

1324~~~
He would be the best full back in the world if he learns how to cross properly. He was the best winger when he used to cross until he found out winning corners is much easier than crossing and losing the ball.

1325~~~
Great performance and one of few who deserve to be part of the squad next year.

1326~~~
We have so much more drive on the right hand side of the pitch when he's playing RB. Wouldn't mind an upgrade, of course, because his defensive side could be better, but he's not the most immediate problem.

And I thought he did really well today, had a big part in the winner and the Fellaini chance early in the 2nd half.

1327~~~
Great today and been really good since his return. I don't even particularly like him but I don't understand how people want him sold. Sell your best RB in the hope that Darmian gets better, wtf kind of logic is that?

1328~~~
MOTM today for me.

1329~~~
Very good at RB. Posses a threat going forward and a good defender. Would be happy with him as first choice RB next season.

1330~~~
Never seen him smile this much... was someone pulling his chins? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1331~~~
Been superb since he came back. I have no issue with him starting next season. He's been a cracking fullback under LvG.

1332~~~
Absolutely brilliant today. I've said it before but he's quite underrated.

1333~~~
Still doesn't get a green 7+ rating on the caf. Criminal!

1334~~~
Was good today but I'd prefer a specialist in his position not a converted failed winger, he's decent back up but he shouldn't be a starter at man Utd in his position.

1335~~~
He actually curled that cross in today for Martials header. Couldn't believe it. 6 years I've been waiting for that

1336~~~
I guess by that logic you didn't rate schweinsteiger in his prime when he switched to CM and will never rate Rooney in CM. Players adapt. Valencia is a right back now, and I would have him as our first choice next season. I was saying the same thing last season too.

1337~~~
Fair enough on Bastian but AV has made far too many simple mistakes because he's not a through and through defender, and Rooney in midfield is open to future performances, if he turns out great then fair enough but I don't think he will make it, he's mainly there because we seem to have to accommodate him in every game he's fit.

1338~~~
Isn't Bale a failed LB converted into a winger? Also, we have a specialist - his name is Darmian and he's a starter for Italy. But guess what, Valencia is miles better than him.

1339~~~
A good game and a good month from him. He has his flaws but his presence helps to balance out the side by virtue of his work rate up and down the right. His crossing has actually become a little more varied and productive as well.

Should start the next season as first choice RB if we don't make a purchase in that position IMO.

1340~~~
I agree. He gives width and still runs strong with pace. His end product at times can be questionable, but when he drives hes a great outlet for us. I do think he will get caught out defensively at times, but im hoping next season is one where we get back to controlling games and putting pressure on opposition with attacks, where he will be more than useful.

1341~~~
Has been great since returning from injury. Would have no qualms with seeing him start at RB next season!

1342~~~
Absolute machine of a man. As with most of the current crop there are flaws in his game but I love having him in the side.

1343~~~
I've been without doubt his biggest critic down the years but he was exceptional today.

1344~~~
fecking love tony v. Been class since returning from injury and I can see him playing a very big role next season with Mourinho... Not many better right backs in the league when he is on form because of how beastly he is. Just a machine. Hopefully he stays fit.

1345~~~
Call me crazy but let's say if we fail to get a new right winger I actually want to see Valencia as our right winger again. Ever since he came back from injury he has been a different player. Faster, stronger, beat players and quality crosses. It's like watching 2009-2011 Tony V again.

And about today's game he was my MOTM alongside Rooney. Tough to choose.

1346~~~
It's terrifying how much better his mentality is than the rest of our squad. Confident on the ball, brave, tireless...can't believe it but we've seriously missed him (as well as Shaw) this season.

1347~~~
He's solid, reliable and dependable. One of our best I thought.

1348~~~
You're crazy. The man is one of the bluntest right sided players around. Full back is where his future lies at United.

1349~~~
I guess I am but I rather see him as a right winger than the options we are currently have. Just like the old days he will put a good balance on the right side.

1350~~~
I'd imagine and hope that a right sided midfielder is a priority this summer.

1351~~~
If we can get one.

1352~~~
I'd be happy with him starting at right-back next season - the issue is that there is no good cover for him should he get injured (unless Darmian picks up form quickly), and that if we were to sign another RB, it may as well be the best RB that is possibly available. 

He's definitely not one of the issues in our team, I feel. People blame him for turning sideways and passing back, but in a team that plays fast and fluid football, his pace, directness, first touch & even his finishing, he shows his worth. If he has the right player in front of him (or even full-back behind him) with a mobile midfielder like Herrera (run-in of last season when he did everything on our right) in the middle, he will show his qualities again. He's definitely superior to the Valencia of 12/13 and 13/14, when he took the #7 and lost his form.

1353~~~
Mensah is a good cover for him should he get injured.

1354~~~
How is he still so fast and powerful? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Recently he's looked a better player than he has for about three or four years

1355~~~
Unlike Schweinsteiger, most 30 year olds are able to run and maintain high levels of fitness.

1356~~~
He was playing with metal in his foot. There's a good chance he had limited movement or was playing with pain.

1357~~~
He's an unsung hero. Was very very good as a proper chalk on boot type winger during his early days with us and is now a reliable fullback. I like him.

1358~~~
True, but I imagine with good performances he will see a lot of time in midfield, or potentially as a centre-back if we don't sign anyone to partner Smalling. I'll be surprised to see Mourinho keep Blind as first choice centre-back. That said, unless he is a starter, he will be able to cover at RB most times. I think he's better as a LB, CM or CB, though. 

Varela is another option. I'd like to see us not sign a new RB just so that we can have Varela show what he can do, with him and Valencia being our two main options there. I think he can be a big player for us. He goes forward like a Manchester United full-back should, but he also knows how to defend one on one.

1359~~~
Physically he is very strong. Players are bouncing off him. Very good player to have in the squad.

1360~~~
He is one of the great players we had and always contribute to the team. And he is really underrated on here.

1361~~~
My favourite player at United. Yep limited compared to what he was for us and his crossing is frustrating but he's like a throw back. Never gets bullied no diving no complaining just a solid pro. We could do with a couple more like him.

1362~~~
There must be a reason every manager loves him.

He isnt the player he was a few seasons ago.. But he isnt a problem. The criticism players like him get doesnt make sense to me.

1363~~~
I've been really quite impressed with Valencia since his return from injury. If he can continue in the same vein, I'm happy for him to stay.

I think Mourinho would like him too, he's a very good athlete and always puts in a shift.

1364~~~
He's been impressive since he came back, I really like him these days.

1365~~~
There was a long period of time, after he took on the no. 7 jersey, I think, when he stopped taking on players regularly and rarer still in getting past them. Then there was the time he was learning his craft in RB where he made defensive errors. He looks to have overcome those and is making the position his own. Bar Fosuh Mensah, possibly and potentially, the RB position is his to screw up.

1366~~~
Not a big fans of Varela as a right back. I prefer right back who knows how to defend for minimum requirement not how to cross the ball.

1367~~~
His stamina is out of this world. When down to 10 he played like 2 players down that wing. If not for his run we wouldn't of had that 2nd. Well done tony.

Oh and he handled bolasie with ease, how many others manager that?

1368~~~
I'm happy that he is finally getting appreciated by the cafe and is being called a right back. we really miss him when he's not in the team. especially with the watch we play

1369~~~
Going through a lot of the players instagrams (including Valencias own) he is smiling, laughing and dancing. 

I'm convinced that this guy is an imposter.

1370~~~
It's his happy twin brother!

1371~~~
Agreed I'm wondering if that Di Maria's Angel isn't a manufactured person at this point <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

AV was very good yesterday. If not for his determination to get that cross in we might have had to play the lottery yesterday.

1374~~~
50/50. Harsh.

1375~~~
He definitely seems to play with more aggression for his country. At United he's usually pretty calm and rarely does rash things. Seems to lose his rag a bit for Ecuador, I suppose it's the pride and passion of being his countries captain.

1376~~~
No idea why, but this made me laugh

1377~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That wasn't harsh, he just lost his temper and kicked him. Easy decision for ref.

1378~~~
One does not simply feck with Valencia.
