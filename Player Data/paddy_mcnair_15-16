I think he played well in the first two games at RB and was good as a CB in his 30 minutes against Barca tonight. The fact he got the nod ahead of Evans is a big boost for him and to me he just looks physically a bit stronger than he was a few months ago.

2~~~
Has continued to look good, the only thing I can complain about is the few times he kept hold of the ball too long and tried to run too far with it. Wasn't given much support in ways of a pass though.

3~~~
All the discussions about CB. McNair should be considered one of the options. I dont get worried seeing him.
He will only get better.

4~~~
He'll get his chances this season, he looks to have developed physically over the summer. Finally starting to look like a CB

5~~~
Firmly ahead of Evans now, wonder if he'll get some action in the UCL...

6~~~
no he's not Evans was probably just injured

7~~~
I'd like to see him alongside Rojo in some cup games, to see what chemistry he can develop. He is definitely one we should continue to groom for the future

8~~~
Evans isnt injured, lvg has confirmed that the only injured player is jones....and in talking about his cb options the other day, Evans was excluded...he's definetly ahead of him....although most likely because Evans is completely out of Lvg's plans..

9~~~
He named Smalling, Jones and McNair only so he probably meant the RCB options. Evans has (from memory) only played on the left or at least mostly. He's a good passer of the ball and capable with his left so I assume he's fighting for the LCB spot with Blind and Rojo who van Gaal also didn't mention.

If a centreback does come in Evans is the most likely player to leave seeing he's the only one who didn't get a new contract or was signed by van Gaal so I agree with the second part.

10~~~
This isn't a league cup game.

People saying we should rest so and so are being silly really. This is one of the most important games of our season and we should play our best team.

11~~~
Perhaps, but then thinking of the left foot thing that LVG said..but you may be right..but he's definitely behind all the those two though..even in the preseason, I think LVG preferred Smalling and McNair as part of that second team, with Evans hardly getting any game time.

12~~~
Believe me, I know..I was not thinking of a start, maybe a sub appearance if we were leading perhaps.

13~~~
People are actually saying we should rest players? Crazy talk.

14~~~
Want him to start the 2nd leg with Smalling. Would be happy just to see him get 20 minutes though

15~~~
Agreed. He looks like he has potential, far more than Blackett in my opinion.

16~~~
Agree that it'd be good to see him get some game time this season. With Blind playing CB, it's likely he'll struggle to get many games since he'll be 5th choice if Evans also stays, but he looked composed at times when he slotted in last season, and definitely has some potential. Hopefully we'll play him every so often.

17~~~
I wouldn't really want him starting tomorrow night. I feel the first 20 minutes or so will be quite nervy. If we are home and dry late on, then yeah, I wouldn't mind him getting a run out.

18~~~
Mental. How about we take the game seriously and not feck up all last years hard work?

19~~~
Yup. The worst possible thing we could do would be to start dicking around in such an important match.

20~~~
Start him tomorrow? Are people crazy? 

He's been terrible and nervous in nearly every away game he has played in last season. So let's start him in the most important away game of our season. 

Makes sense.

21~~~
It's not like Blind is some world class CB. He's done well so far having not being tested. I doubt he's actually a better CB than McNair.

22~~~
But our back line is settled and we have a partnership that works, it's fair too risky at this stage.

23~~~
I was surprised when he came on, not sure if he got caught cold on the second Pelle goal or it was a lack of communication with him and Smalling or if it was simply a bloody good ball that put it right on Pelle's bonce, but he made an important contribution with that driving run that got us right up the pitch and relieved the pressure in injury time.

24~~~
Reckon he might get a start against Ipswich to give Blind a rest for a game.

25~~~
Was really thrown in there. Didn't really understand it but he did a pretty decent job, as posted above that was one really tasty run.

26~~~
Lionel McNair <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Should have done better for the 2nd goal though.

27~~~
I agree. We shouldn't take Ipswhich too lightly but there's a couple of others I'd like to see sit out as well: such as Darmian, Martial, and Memphis.

28~~~
Was sleeping for their 2nd goal but it was not the best game to throw him in imo

29~~~
He did not know where Pelle was for the second goal, but then what a run from him right at the end

30~~~
I don't really care for him, he's poor and not UTD quality. Ridiculous positioning for their second goal and defended poorly over all, Smalling had to cover him a few times.

31~~~
Looking forward to Jones being back to come on in situations like that, thrown in at the deep end a bit but if we played for 10 more minutes we would have lost 4-3..looked all over the show when he came on.

32~~~
I think he needs a season in the championship and playing regularly. He is good on the ball but defensively he is nowhere near good enough to be anywhere near the team and we aren't good enough to carry him. There is potential there but sitting on the bench is not going to help him improve.

33~~~
That's what I feel too. Defensively especially away from home he is not somebody that I would want to call upon. The whole defence starts getting nervous.

34~~~
I think we're only sticking him on the bench to keep that youth team/matchday squad streak going. Will be interesting when Jones comes back.

35~~~
Impressive performance today. LvG would not play him if he didn't rate him highly. All a part of his long term development imo.

36~~~
Not necessarily. I think we only have one fit CB, so we dont keep him on the bench for our youth record, but because we need one. LvG gave him some minutes today, again nothing to do with our record. I think he just rates him a bit.

37~~~
Yeah, agree with this. He showed real potential against West Ham and Everton when he first came into the team last season so I have hope that he'll make it here but he's far from ready atm. Most of his best work comes with the ball which is good for us if he does improve defensively though.

38~~~
I thought bringing him on was more of a psychological move after he was yanked in the first half last season. Fair play to LvG, he obviously thinks a lot of him and wanted to give him some confidence. I don't think even Blind would have done any better for the second goal, that was just a beauty of a cross placed right between the two center backs.

39~~~
Yeah, although the Shaw injury means that's unlikely. If Rojo is th LB this season then we only have Blind, Smalling and Jones at CB. That's not enough. 

Maybe he'll get a season of cup matches and spot starts this year and next year can go on a Premier League loan with Shaw back and maybe even a new LCB signed.

40~~~
He was too far from his man. You should at least be interrupting the attacker. Can't be allowing them to get a free header.

Was a weird sub. Putting Blind up against Mane, who had been going past players all game and is a lot quicker, was simply a bad move. At the same time you're splitting up the CB partnership. Two games in a row LvG has done that now and both games we've conceded after doing so.

41~~~
It was a great cross which didn't allow him anytime to try judge the cross. Not a single one of our defenders was anywhere near marking a man, he is just the unlucky to be the one closest to Pelle so he gets all the blame.

42~~~
You make it sound like Pelle just came from nowhere to get the header. McNair was next to him and left him drift away from him. It was poor from him.

43~~~
No I'm not. He also wasn't next to him, he was always a few feet away. Pelle was standing in the middle of McNair, Smalling and Schweinsteiger before the cross came in. Probably closest to Schweinsteiger actually with McNair actually being the farthest away as the ball was about to be played. What I'm actually saying is there was also two Southampton players deeper in the box who neither Valencia or Smalling decided to mark, a runner in who neither Rooney or Schneiderlin decided to mark either. Sure, it was poor but using it as a stick to beat him with as not being good enough is ridiculous when at the exact same time we had 5 other players in the box making no attempt at marking a man either. If the ball went to any of those 3 Southampton players to tap in would our other defenders not be good enough? Smalling was standing right there too, where is his criticism? He also decided to completely disregard runners on the first goal but oh no Smalling can't be criticized he does everything by himself.

44~~~
Looking at it again I think you're right, his awareness was poor but he had just come on.

The only reason I can think for the substitution is that Rojo was out of steam as he's not played much football recently.

45~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/fnty" width="560"></iframe>
Okay, he wasn't next to him but he's clearly the one that's supposed to be keeping an eye on Pelle. I don't know why you're bringing up hypothetical situations either, if any of them did happen then those players would obviously get criticism but they didn't happen.

46~~~
That run was great. I genuinely thought he was Memphis.

47~~~
A hard game to get accustomed to quickly. I really don't like to see changes made to the back four unless it is due to injury, or perhaps if someone is on the cusp of getting sent off. It really does cause a lot of disorganisation and it showed. Surely McNair could have slotted in at left back and just kept things neat and tidy. Ending the game with only 1 out of the back 4 still in the position they started in seems excessive.

A little poor from him for the goal, but it was a strange time to bring on a defender, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt a little. He looks very talented, especially on the ball. I'd like to see more of him if Blind is going to play at left back, which I would be fine with. I do like Rojo but I think Blind has more about him at both CB and LB.

Smalling and McNair could be a good pair. McNair is seriously composed for a lad of his age and experience.

48~~~
Injured

49~~~
Is he? I haven't seen anything

50~~~
Just a minor one so won't be out for long.

51~~~
For feck sakes if true as Ipswich was the perfect game to start him. Frustrating.

52~~~
Small point, but why is the Union Flag used for McNair and not an Ulster Banner or something. I know it isn't an official flag, but it is the one the IFA use.

53~~~

54~~~
Ruptured liver.. that sounds bad. Had no idea he was injured

55~~~
Is Rojo even fit?

56~~~
He'll make it on Everton but Jones is closer to get a full 90 minutes so far.

57~~~
Scary reading about the ruptured liver. Wish him a speedy recovery.

58~~~
Don't think he'll be back anytime soon.

59~~~
Since when was a ruptured liver considered "minor?" and how the hell did that happen to him?

60~~~
I didnt see the game but saw some comments in the matchday thread at the time, he spent several minutes getting treatment early in the game and was expected to get taken off and there was some surprise when he continued 

so Im assuming he did it early on but they didnt realise what it was and let him play on even until after half time

61~~~
Apparently is fairly common and in some cases, can heal on its own.

62~~~
I cant wait for him to be back.  The way he dribbles at pace from the CB position is actually very exciting on the eyes and shifting him in to a fullback could get the best out of him long term.

63~~~
Good to see him back and he slotted in to the back 3 comfortably.

64~~~
I prefer him as a centre back to Rojo. I genuinely think he has the potential to be a similar player and play at a similar level to Stones.

65~~~
Tough ask from him today, I think he did well.

66~~~
if he plays he can be our sort of new Jonny Evans, that's how I see him and his potential, good on the ball, making plenty of mistakes but steadily learning from them becoming one of the best in the league in a good form. He's good potential but there are potentially betters like Tuanzebe, Williams, CBJ, TFM so lets see if he gets enough chances and takes them. Stones is different level in my opinion but like all young talented players he just needed games to get better, we have so many good center backs..

the change to 3-5-2 is good encourgement for McNair, hopefully it was an only quick fix though..

67~~~
Tough situation for him to come back into but did fine. Good to see him back. Will be needed during this period.

68~~~
Chance to him to prove himself as a reliable option,possibly over the never-fit Jones.

69~~~
It's weird that I washould not worried when he came on, smart player and seems to have put on some muscle too.

70~~~
This is the one huge positive we have from having Van Gaal as our gaffer, he seems to know exactly who to promote and when to plus he intentionally backed himself into a corner by gutting the squad of excess fat. This means more chances for those who are talented and want it enough. Five years from now players like McNair, Perreira, Lingard and others he will promote will be his greatest legacy to United.

On McNAIR, it's good to have him back and being thrown into such a tough situation and doing well. I hope he is trusted in the next few games because, with his technical ability, his development will be exciting to watch over the next twenty four months. I certainlt agree with posters that see shades of Jonny Evans and Stones.

71~~~
He's put on some size over the summer.

72~~~
He's overlooked quite a lot compared to our other excellent youth products but he's actually a good young player (playing well above what he should be for his age) I think he has the potential to be a very good defender, what we all expected Evans to be basically.

73~~~
I agree. Although Stones has an innate calmness which puts him ahead at the moment.

74~~~
Thought he did well.

There was a lovely moment where he had the chance to just hoof it clear but instead he took a touch, steadied himself and advanced with the ball. Encouraging to see.

75~~~
I'd rather he got a shot as Jones's deputy over going back to Blind or using Rojo. He showed against Chelsea last season that he's capable. He'll cost us goals because he's young but Blind and Rojo will do so too due to their limitations.

Also, brave guy for getting back from a nasty injury so quickly. I really hope he makes it here.

76~~~
Mata seems to rate him; Paddy was the first guy he picked when asked about good upcoming youth prospects.

77~~~
Not really sure Leicester away is the best place to start him. I don't think he's been great away from home.

Some of his performances against Everton, Swansea and Southampton last season away from home were awful.

78~~~
He was great at right back away at Swansea last season when he was randomly thrown in.

Oh no, wait, he wasn't. Poor kid, being horribly managed.

79~~~
We shouldn't have left ourselves in a position where he is even required to start games like this. He should be out on loan in the championship because that is his current level, hopefully he can do a job today though.

80~~~
I like McNair, he looks a good player.

81~~~
Great to see that Van Gaal keeps on giving chances to our young players, will be interesting to see if he plays at RB or CB.

82~~~
Happy for him, big test for him tonight.

83~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> embarrassing.

84~~~
No, just true.

He had a few shockers away last season actually. The kid is clearly talented, and I think has a promising future. But randomly throwing him in for games like this, especially out of position, is poor management.

85~~~
I hope he's partnering Smalling as a CB.

86~~~
LVG just had a massive go at McNair in the post match interview. Poor bloke

87~~~
Just complained about this on another thread. Was bang out of order I think.

We conceded one goal from a corner and defended very well otherwise. McNair came back in after a while out and I thought did well.

Our attack has been shite for 12 months and he's never singled one of them out for such public criticism.

88~~~
Not see his comments, but I do think he was poor today.

89~~~
I'm actually quite annoyed that LVG singled him out like that. Young players can't be doing with that.

90~~~
Fine performance, petty from van Gaal, strange philosophy. Digs into the youngsters at any opportunity yet walks on eggshells around the senior players. You would think it would be the other way around. Build the youngsters up.

91~~~
He was alright. Smalling was the star defender. Blind was the ball playing defender. 
McNair was the 3rd guy. Who had little to do. 
Made a mistake. The 2 defensive midfielders and 4 defenders on the pitch didnt do enough to cover for him. And he gets the blame. 

He is young, probably too bored watching us play keepball at 1-1. I don't blame him much.

Van Gaal is just deflecting from our other problems

92~~~
I don't remember McNair doing anything terrible at any stage, thus making his performance significantly better than Darmian, Carrick, Rooney and  Young's, not sure why LVG has had a go but left others out.

93~~~
He was ok, young and learning in a shitty formation under a hostile crowd, LvG can feck off and suck Rooney's nob with the singling a youngster out cowardice.

94~~~
I thought he did alright. A few errors but that is understandable considering he hasn't played in a while.

95~~~
Needs a loan. Not good enough at the moment.

96~~~
Was shit but it's difficult when he isn't a fullback and seemingly doesn't have the skills (dribbling, pace, passing/crossing) to play there and provide an attacking threat. Really did play like a CB at fullback.

97~~~
He was very poor. A professional should never be passing the ball out or running it out, and he did both today.

98~~~
1st division level of player

99~~~
I can think of quite a few central defenders who looked very ordinary at right back. Normally McNair looks reasonably composed on the ball but not today.

100~~~
Other than against lower league opposition he's struggled at RB, definitely don't see his future there.

101~~~
His mentality is such a big issue. Again, a couple of little mistakes have such a negative influence on the rest of his game, to the extent that it falls apart completely. 

It's actually quite rare for a United academy product to lack resilience and confidence.

102~~~
He isn't a united player long term. I don't think. Valera did OK when he came on I guess.

103~~~
He's not a right back. He always looks impressive when he plays at centre back. I just don't think he's good in those tight spaces along the touchline. Smalling and Jones had similar performances when played at full back. I don't know why LvG keeps persisting with it and then dragging him off early, which will do nothing for his confidence.

I think he has a future here. We just need to stop playing him at full back, which we constantly lambasted when Smalling and Jones played there.

104~~~
I've never been that impressed with him at centre back or right back? He was a midfielder right at youth? He needs to have the pitch in front of him not down the touchline and in his own penalty box. 

Poor management from LVG imo.

105~~~
Him going to Mata and then taking the free-kick was interesting to see.. Put one or two good crosses in but defensively quite iffy..

106~~~
I honestly don't see what some on here see in the guy. I even read tripe saying he can be as good as Stones; I mean what, just what! He's not good enough. It's all well and good brining through youth team players but not just for the sake of it.

107~~~
He's still learning the defensive side of the game.He might or might not turn out to be good enough but people need to understand that.

108~~~
So quick to rule out young players, some people need to see that Chris Smalling is 26 and is having his first world class season for Man Utd.

109~~~
He is only involved in first team because of injuries, he is nowhere near ready. 

Personally I don't think he is a great prospects he is just a decent player who has come through the academy who has been in the right place at the right time, he needs a couple of years out on loan to have any chance of having a long term future here.

110~~~
Smalling was injury prone though. That's why people were fed up.

111~~~
He has only looked good at RB against that cup match vs a lower division team.  

He seems to be one of LVG's youth 'projects' which he always seems to have though, so I expect him to get plenty of chances.

112~~~
He was also shite at RB. 

McNair is just coming back from injury too. He wasn't even that bad and is being played out of position.

113~~~
He's awful and will never be good enough to play at this level.

114~~~
Any word why Young didn't start at RB today?

115~~~
He's not a RB. He played at CM for U18s and CB for the U21s.

I hate seeing him stuck out there, it's unfair to him. Varela at FB is a better option, definitely.

116~~~
He was a colossus away at Stamford Bridge last year. Plays well when ball-playing cb with the freedom to launch the attacks from time to time. I think he could make a decent DM if played that way since the academy days but our coaching  far more knowledgeable opinion of his skills means they try to fetch him a good career at CB. My view is he can make a decent one no problem.

117~~~
Yesterday, there were moments when he found himself on the right side of the halway line with the whole wing in front of him and two opponents for company. not really Paddys thing, moreso because of audible urges to go at them. No other United player there to help him out, let alone his winger Mata who's probably dancing in circles somewhere in the centre mid at that time. With his game style you either go on a gallop hoping to get a foul/corner or pass it back.

RB won't work. CB/DM could perhaps but too many factors influencing his progress.

I'd give him time. He's well above Blackett, though, whom I never quite understood the point of.

118~~~
He obviously isn't a RB and shouldn't be played there. So I won't be too harsh on him but it was a bad game.

119~~~
Good point. I noticed it last season a few times.

120~~~
He looks better at centre back than at right back. I don't know why we keep playing him there, it all seems to be based on one decent performance against a League Two side in an FA Cup replay at home.

121~~~
He is such a weird player. At centre back he looks like a very good passer and technically sound, but at right back he looks lost. When he carries the ball into attack from the centre back position he also looks quite fast, but playing at right back, he looks awfully slow. Decent option at CB, but please just play fullbacks at the fullback position. Varela was better defensively and offered at least something in attack.

122~~~
Two words. Can't defend, Martin.

123~~~
He's too slow many times though Varela isn't helping much on that side.

124~~~
Said this for ages. There's lots of good things about him such as his passing and composure but he's just not a defender.

125~~~
I did say his defending is championship level.

People were comparing him to Stones. But no surprise as people here tend to overrate our young players.

126~~~
Stones is obviously better but the current Stones isn't the best defensively as well.

127~~~
maybe as a defensive midfielder he wouldnt need to be as fast but as a defender hes found out too often, hes also not strong enough to deal with some defenders, not focused either, needs to keep fecking concentration, he`s too sloppy and again surprised with the tempo of the game, I`d personally loaned him in Jan if our CBs are ready, he needs to play and iron all those mistakes, hes now more error prone than Jonny Evans, I wouldnt mind if we gave chance to Tuanzebe/CBJ as CBs when we hit injury crysis..

128~~~
The defenders we're producing seem to be getting worse and worse at actually defending.

From the likes of Brown and O'Shea, to Evans and now McNair and Blackett.

129~~~
But he is miles ahead of McNair. 

McNair shits himself in every away game. Not a great mentality to have.

130~~~
Toilet

131~~~
Gets turned by Glen Murray.

Great passer, but can't defend.

132~~~
I struggle to see what people see in him.

133~~~
Was terrible there but Blind wasn't much better. Got totally sucked in leaving McNair 1v1

134~~~
Compared to him OShit looks like Baresi in his prime and on steriods

135~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

136~~~
He's not a CB. As Lvg said he is a Rb in the making.

137~~~
He's been horrible this season. But he's only 20. No point writing him off.

138~~~
A poor mans Johnny Evans. And that's saying something.

139~~~
Today he's been the worst player on the pitch together with the ref. Can't understand why we just don't BUY a really good defender. I mean, we could even move in for a guy like freaking MEXES just to be sure we at least have a chance of becoming champions. Why go on with this ridiculous shit.

140~~~
Absolute shocking. Just because he's young it doesn't mean he will become a good player. Championship level if not league 1 at best. Blackett wasn't any worse and he can't even get a game at Celtic because he's not good enough.

141~~~
He is pretty shite. No way Man Utd quality.

142~~~
Blackett is a much worse player.That's not even debatable.

Very poor performance.Not helped much by Blind and Varela who were also poor defensively.

143~~~
It's his second season and he should be showing signs of improvement. He may be very comfortable on the ball but defensively he still doesn't convince.

144~~~
There really isn't much hope in a CB who can't defend.

145~~~
Thought he was easily the worst player on the pitch.

146~~~
He looks like he could do with a loan.Playing every week to iron his defensive awareness which has improved but still left a lot to desire.Just doesn't have the natural reaction and aggressiveness a defender should have at the level required.

147~~~
Hailed as the next best thing last season and after an injury prone second season is now considered shite!, yeah, our fans really are a supportive bunch, its great to see players being written off so early into their careers.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

148~~~
This. What's he supposed to be good at?

149~~~
Poor Paddy had a McMare.

150~~~
Think we've seen enough to know he isn't United quality, willing to give the two kids at left and right back more time, but Paddy isn't up to it for me.

151~~~
It's not his fault he's being played in the first team when he's nowhere near ready for it.

152~~~
Even last season away at Southampton, Swansea and Everton he looked like shit. He shits himself in away games, when we have defending to do.

The only positive is that he's a good passer. But he can't defend. I rather have Carrick as a CB.

He also gets nutmegged far too much for a defender. If this is the future, I fear for the future. Brown and O'Shea were 1000 times better than McNair.

153~~~
I know he's young and it is harsh to completely condemn him to mediocrity, but I just don't see it. He might grow into a decent player at an average level but I just don't think he will be good enough for us. No stand out attributes IMO.

154~~~
I agree with this. Hes only 20 and is playing with next to a non defender, and 2 more inexperienced youngsters. If he was playing next to somebody like Rio and Evra in their prime and not learning than fine, but I think the reactions to our youngsters is a bit OTT.

155~~~
I just asked in the Blind thread as well but how is Blind not a defender?

156~~~
Hes a convert. It would be like saying Young is a RB. Blind has done well (but I believe thats because of Smalling mostly), whilst Blind looks exposed when hes not there (and at times even when he is there)

157~~~
He's young but he needs to get out of the starting line up and back to getting experience with the reserves asap. His defending at times today was the sort of thing you'd see at an amateur level.

158~~~
A convert from when? He has played the majority of his career at LB.

159~~~
See the other thread re: saying defender means CB.
I said "non defender" but I meant CB.

160~~~
Alright, fair enough. I see a lot of people complaining he isn't a defender though and saying he has to play in midfield.

161~~~
Hes done well as CB, but I dont think its a long term fix. I actually think he should be playing LB with us playing 433, or he should be used CB if were playing a team at home that will "park the bus" as he can come out as an extra man or hit those diagonals.

Anyway, digressed from McNair. I said before I wanted him to go out on a loan. I have a feeling he will end up like Blackett.

162~~~
In hindsight it might have been more beneficial to keep Evans for another season (assuming he didn't mind a rotation role) and loan McNair and Blackett out to get a true gauge on their ability. Perhaps van Gaal was a bit blinded by a good performance against Chelsea last season and thought he was ready for senior football at Manchester United.

163~~~
Don't see any distinctive quality in him. Can be the rotation player for now which then wouldn't be favorable to his development.
Just a hunch, I think of Norwich when I see him.

164~~~
I was one of the people who was very impressed with him in the initial few games he played. He looked a good ball player with decent defensive ability. This season he just looks a white right-footed Blackett. Doesn't look very good on ball, the defensive side has gone kaput, positioning is atrocious & I don't know why he runs away with the ball time and again. 

Definitely needs a loan. Not giving up on him. His chances aren't looking very bright, though. Shame we sold M.Keane, he could have been very useful right about now.

165~~~
Was poor yesterday .Caught in posession quite a lot and had a mare against Joshua.

166~~~
I think he's been trained in to a RB. Bar what LVG already said about this; what you have said sounds like a RB too.

167~~~
Really lost a bit of momentum this season but i think he has the natural talent to be a good defender as he has shown it last season.

168~~~
I don't think he the pace to make his mark at the RB spot. That is why the plan to have him become our "RB for the next 10 years" was shunned quickly.

169~~~
Ivanovic a season or 2 back was quality at RB so was zabaleta.  So i think it still could be done.

170~~~
He just isn't anywhere near good enough at the moment no matter what position he is given. He should be out on loan in the championship.

171~~~
He was much more assured on the ball last season.

172~~~
I don't agree with all these talks of loans. Give him a place in the squad, get him games and see where that takes us. 

Loaning out players means we'll have to buy someone to take their place. Don't see how we can reintegrate them back once that happens.

173~~~
He's better than Vidic at the same age.

174~~~
That doesn't really say much though.

175~~~
Exactly. We know some defenders will get eventually injured in the same time and squad is already thin as Peter Crouch. Only getting extremely lucky in January and acquiring talents like Laporte or Marquinhos would create comfort of SAF's famous headache (keeping in mind they won't get injured that easily).

176~~~
It says that he's a top CB for his age and worth developing. I mean, it hardly would make sense to get a CB the same age but less talented and develop him.

We brought Evans through, I think we can bring McNair though. 

That said, surely he's around for the League Cup, FA Cup, relegation teams and emergency cover. In that capacity I think he's doing fine. 

Of course I do notice the gulf of difference when Smalling goes out and Paddy goes in. 

And I'm red tinted when it comes to the youth team, by my own admission.

177~~~
Is he a top CB for his age?

John Stones is only 1 year older, i'd say he's a top CB. 
Laporte is only 1 year older. Varane is 2 years older. Marquinhos is only 1 year older. 

McNair hasn't showed anything close to the level of those guys, and i'd say they are the best young CB's in Europe right now.

Even comparing him to Vidic isn't really worthwhile as he's not a similar style defender to Vidic.
Ferdinand at his age was also a much better talent. Wes Brown at McNair's age was a much better talent.

He's fine for a squad level player definitely, but I haven't seen anything to suggest he'll be amongst the top defenders in the country, I could be wrong though.

178~~~
Nearly every time I watch him play he puts in a horrible performance, sometimes he doesn't look to bad on the ball but defensively he needs to improve a lot. He has the same ticking time bomb thing Evans had, its like any moment he can make a mistake.

179~~~
He looks bloody awful with the ball at his feet, always looks like he's going to give it away. I've never seen a player get skinned as much as he did on Saturday, it wasn't good for him.

180~~~
He can't defend that's why.

He got skinned last season for the first Everton goal. I'd say Keane was a better defender than McNair. Even the likes of Shawcross who we let go in the past  is miles better than McNair. He literally can't defend.

181~~~
The more McNair plays the more likely we are to buy someone because he isn't good enough, playing an odd game here and there and being out of his depth doesn't help him or the team. If he goes out on loan and comes back a better player it is a good problem to have, he can't defend well enough and he will only learn by playing regularly not by sitting on the bench or in the stands and only playing if there is an injury crisis.

182~~~
All of these comparisons won't work because nobody out of them are converted CB.McNair is a "project", gonna need time to learn his trade defensively regardless of how some here think that's already all that he can do.

183~~~
I was simply replying to why it's not really of much use to say Vidic at his age wasn't performing to high levels either.
The truth is each player develops differently and comparisons such as that don't really tell us much.

Past indicators don't really tell for future performance particularly in a sport where so many factors have an impact on the overall development of a player.

184~~~
Definitely worth persisting with IMO. He has had some good games and some bad games, it isn't like he's consistently been crap so I don't understand why people are absolutely shitting on him. As bad as he was against Bournemouth (and he was terrible) it was obviously a difficult situation for him - he only stepped up from the reserves a year ago and was still by far the 2nd most experienced member of that back four... and the most experienced one has only been playing there for a few months! And this wasn't some Carling Cup game, it was away from home in the Premier League.

185~~~
He was absolutely dreadful on Saturday. He made so many mistakes and was skinned a lot. 

He is not yet good enough to be our next in line in the CB positions and we really needed to buy someone this summer.

186~~~
I like McNair. Not a United fan but I've always been impressed by him for the most part. He's composed, good on the ball and agile. I don't think he's the best defensively yet but it's harsh to write him off at such a young age especially when he's never had a run of games alongside a natural, experienced CB. 

A loan to a top Championship team or even better a team in the Premier League, I'd take him at Sunderland, where he would play every week and get better defensively with game time, is probably exactly what he needs.

187~~~
So you're the one ?

188~~~
He is a bit better than Blackett but not as good as either Thorpe or Keane.

189~~~
Let's try this January then. Call me naive but few smart transfer moves and we're back in this title race while the gap isn't 10 points (plus maybe with a bit better luck with injuries).

190~~~
??

191~~~
THE Sunderland fan.

192~~~
Hilarious. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

193~~~
I keep thinking he's a box to box midfielder being shoehorned into a center back.

194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I am not sure he meant anything wrong.

195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I was wondering wtf you were on about!

196~~~
Is he expected to play this weekend? What's your injury update?

197~~~
I saw something in Smalling even when he was being written off and I think I see it with McNair too. He needs experience, first and foremost, but then he needs to go through the phase of learning to apply his natural talents properly. There is definitely a very good player on there, it'll just take time.

198~~~
I keep thinking hes a championship level type of player shoehorned into an epl one

199~~~
He's not good enough and for his sake should go play week in week out for a weaker side like the likes of Drinkwater etc have done.

200~~~
Yep, Paddy has regressed a bit this season but let's not forget what he did for us last season.  Definitely send him on loan to a club which will play him, either EPL or championship is fine.  But only if we bring in a proper CB, which we must make one of our top two priorities for January.  If not, then play him as needed.

201~~~
After getting a lot of shit on here recently I thought he did a solid job today, loved his hoof clearance late on, sometimes the simple ways are the best.

202~~~
I think the opposite, thought he was shaky as he has been all season. Got away with a howler when Swansea got the shot away late on. Definetly not a long term defender at United IMO.

203~~~
Hard to judge him when hes played LB at times, CB at times, RB at  times, and its minutes here and there. I think his best position will be CB but maybe he could be a OShea type player for us (which sometimes the team needs even if its not great for the player at all).

Depends what he wants as well.

204~~~
He looked shaky again yesterday, I think he could do with a loan move where he's guaranteed to play every week so the club can judge him better.

205~~~
Useless defender. Shouldn't even be playing for the club.

206~~~
Mcmare is a bit shit

207~~~
Someone said in the match day thread that he would go on a marauding run and you start to think he is player until he makes a terrible defensive mistake. And so it proved to be true.

208~~~
Marking players doesn't seem to be his strong point. Was at fault for Southampton's late goal earlier in the season too.

209~~~
Solid on the ball today but at fault for the goal which is his main job.

210~~~
He can't defend. It's just so brutally obvious, and at this age you can't teach such a fundamental skill enough to bring it up from absolute nothing to being good enough for a title contender. 

Martinez would take him at Everton though.

211~~~
That....kinda sums it up. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

212~~~
Costs us a goal almost every time he plays it seems. Have to think he will be sold soon.

213~~~
Surprised he wasn't our lowest rated player. His mistake essentially cost us the game.

214~~~
Stuck in no mans land. Not good enough

215~~~
no we'd have to score - "cost the game" maybe a point.

216~~~
What does LvG see in this chap?

217~~~
I think LVG should be playing FB and stop hooking him after every bad display. It's doing him more harm than good the way he is being managed. He is developing that Jones habit of trying to do more instead of just concentrate on getting the job done first, this leads to a lot of silly mistakes.

218~~~
He's far too slow to play fullback. 

He shouldn't be in the squad let alone playing out of position. He just can't defend.

219~~~
What's his purpose in the team exactly? One of those young players like Chris Eagles a few years back who randomly gets a run in the team even though it is blatantly obvious he isn't good enough for us.

220~~~
I don't really understand the attitude of some of the posters on here towards Mcnair. Here we have a young player, thrown in to a side bereft of confidence, to cover a rather large injury list. 

I remember some of the praise he was getting on the forum for some of his early games.

As things stand defensively (the way LVG sets us up!) we have

Shaw-injured
Rojo-injured
Jones-injured
Young injured
Valencia-injured
M.Keane-sold
Thorpe-sold
Darmain-injured

So, Mcnair represents what little depth we have left in a threadbare squad because that's the way LVG operates. 

We have a forward line, and a midfield that cost a tonne of money, that can't create a chance between them, and yet posters turn on a young inexperienced defender who cost us nothing?

Give the guy a break, there are bigger problems than him at the moment

221~~~
typical of this place - the team is pretty crap but the standard of poster might well be worse.

222~~~
whatever! Tell me <a class="username" data-user="6512, @RedPhil1957" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/6512/">@RedPhil1957</a> what exactly are you trying to say in your reply to my post?

223~~~
Haha.. Nah.. Playing him at fullback is the best way to blood in young defenders and helps to teach them about defensive structures. 
In contrast to CBJ he tries too hard to impress lately instead of just concentrating on doing the job at hand. 
Majority of the cafe want Blind at fullback, huh my nan can beat him  for pace.

224~~~
He's a box to box midfielder and not a defender. The sad thing is that he has loads of talent if utilized properly. None of that excuses losing your marker like he did today though.

225~~~
Yourself included

226~~~
I'm pretty sure he is agreeing with you.

227~~~
Somehow,I don't think so!

228~~~
I think so.

Typical of this place means its typical of everyone to shit all over young players like you are saying. Then the standard of posters is just shit posts bitching about everything. 

Hey, maybe I'm wrong though.

229~~~
I picked up on the bolded bit, and as that was all he said, I read it as him having a pop at me!

230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

231~~~
Lololol....and sigh.

That was me. As soon as I saw his name I knew something like that would happen and posted it before he even got on the pitch.

Until he gets a run in the middle of the park in a functioning team, I won't criticise him too much but it's depressing seeing the same inevitable the mistakes happen.

edit: here it is

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

232~~~
True.

233~~~
I thought he was going to become the next OShit but the boy show much more promise. Its still early days of course but I think that this guy could well become the next Prunier

234~~~
I feel sorry for the lad because he has been thrown in at the deep end at times but in truth he is utter garbage. I can't see him being at the club beyond the summer.

235~~~
Thing is though, if he starts in the middle or not, his duty on corners remains essentially the same, don't leave your man.

236~~~
I was hoping to see some views on him tonight, I genuinely can barely remember him doing anything right or wrong, I was distracted by the river of shit flowing through midfield..

237~~~
He was poor if you ask me. What happened when they got that insane break from one of our corners? Blind took the corner? Smalling would have been in the box looking to get a header at goal so where were Mcnair and Love?

238~~~
That was bad but I have to wonder where our leaders on the pitch are to organize these young lads in those situations.

239~~~
I didn't see the replay so I don't know what happened but I have never seen anything like that in all my years watching United.

240~~~
He's absolutely dire. 

Use the excuses of injuries etc all you want, but I'd far rather of seen Carrick at CB, or Blind at CB and Lingard at fullback than play McNair. 

League one level at best.

241~~~
It was very amateurish, seemed to leave Trevor Francis pretty bemused.

242~~~
He's got to be one of the worst players I've seen in a United shirt, he is so out of his depth it is painful to watch. Can't believe he had the front to criticise Romero for playing the ball out to him when it was his failure to control the ball which made it roll out for a throw.

243~~~
He's still better than Blackett but I think that's the kindest thing I have to say about him. Will never make it under a competent manager.

244~~~
really not good enough. his first couple games for us must've been a fluke.

245~~~
Had high hopes for him, he had a few genuinely promising performances last season mixed in with a few shit ones. Been nothing other than shit this season. Not gonna <i>completely </i>write him off just yet, very testing circumstances and all that. I'm kind of bias toward the kid though if I'm honest.

246~~~
Nah.... He's pretty bad. No point denying it.

Although, he wasn't originally a centre back. No excuse though for some of his very basic errors anytime I've seen him this season

247~~~
Agreed.

248~~~
He was really good last season when he was the last remaining fit defender.. Maybe it's the formation which him some cover, I don't know but now he looks very bad.

249~~~
I remember him having 3 good games - West Ham home, Cambridge Home and Chelsea away. Only one of them really involved having to do much defending - the West Ham game.

He got hooked before half time at Southampton, hooked at half time vs Swansea and that dreadful performance against Everton away. I think one of the reason he looked good was because Blackett was so shit, he looked pretty good comparison.

250~~~
Would struggle to get a game at most championship clubs, that is his current level and he simply isn't good enough to be involved in the first team at this time. He should have gone out on loan this season, it's done him no favours staying at the club this season.

251~~~
I never saw anything in him whatsoever and now I just think he's an extremely poor player.

252~~~
The reactions from some in this place after a few decent performances was hilarious. Some were saying he could be our long term centre back <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's so poor. Decent passer but terrible at pretty much defensive aspect of the game.

253~~~
One of the worst players i've seen come through the Academy - he is an absolute liability.

254~~~
This. I was a fan of him last season in the few glimpses we saw, but that particular moment was ridiculous. Not even remotely Romero's fault. Probably sums up United, it's all someone else's fault.

He's had a mare this season when he's played. That said, it's hard to judge player's overall ability when the whole team is as shocking as it is, not to mention McNair playing once every 8 games or something. I'd like to see him go on loan and play every week before making a judgement on him, but I do think there is something about him.

255~~~
He's also a coward as well as being shit. At one point around the 50th minute, standing in acres of space he started pointing away so he wouldn't get passed the ball. Blind passed it to him regardless and he played an absolute hospital pass into Herrera leaving him in trouble just to get rid of the ball. That crap with blaming Romero would've been hilarious if it wasn't seemingly a symptom of a bigger problem. Too many cowards in this team, no leaders, everyone happy to pass the buck.

256~~~
I am not a big fan of the Mcfail one but tbf I can't blame him for what's happening. The team is all over the place, the defense lack leadership and he's being played as a defender despite not being one.

257~~~
He reminds me of Johnny Evans. Looks like a bag of nerves.

258~~~
I feel like we kept him around because he's better then Tyler Blackett...

Note: being better then Tyler Blackett should not be an indicator of anything useful.

259~~~
He has no defensive nous.

260~~~
Evans' game was pretty class though. A worthy premier league defender at the very least. 

Just fell apart when he had to be the main man.

261~~~
He'll never be as good as Michael Keane.

262~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12019/10217768/manchester-uniteds-paddy-mcnair-praised-by-michael-oneill" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...niteds-paddy-mcnair-praised-by-michael-oneill</a>

263~~~
He needs to go on loan or even permanent.

264~~~
He's 20, hardly a time to panic over game time. If he can't get games by the time he's 23, sure he needs to find a new club.

265~~~
At least there's a manager that see him as a holding midfielder.Always look like one to me instead of centre-back.

266~~~
That's why I said on loan first, there is no point sitting around here as he simply isn't good enough.

267~~~
We don't know if they are doing personal work with him to rectify his decision making and any technical defects they see that need to be addressed. The coaching staff cannot work on him if he is away on loa and United usually send players out only after they reach a certain level of maturity.

268~~~
The best way for a converted defender like McNair to learn how to defend is through experience.Going on loan is the only way now for McNair to ever have a chance to break in the team again imo with the likes of TFM/Williams already overtaken him.

269~~~
I'd rather believe managers than your opinion TBH.

270~~~
You mean like van Gaal who has dropped him for TFM and Williams? Looks like he has the same opinion as me.

271~~~
He needs a loan. It's undeniable. Barely played this season.

272~~~
They'll have been doing personal work on him for 3 years now. You can't sit around doing personal work until you are 23 and expect to make it. He needs to put it to the test and he isn't going to do that here. If they want to convert him to DM then he can stay in the u21s for a bit but he'll need to go on loan still because he has even less of a chance of playing there for the first team.

273~~~
I like McNair because he likes to attack but it's hard to see him making it here. He's not good enough in possession to be a midfielder here and he's not able to defend. I don't think it's a simple as working with him to teach him how to defend. If that was the case any athletic youngster could play top level football. He just doesn't seem to have sharp enough defensive instincts at this level

274~~~
I think he's awful.

275~~~
Clearly not

He might not be good enough eventually for Utd but I think he can be a premier league defender for sure

276~~~
Nope I really don't think he can be.

277~~~
I haven't seen anything to suggest he could. He's been bad pretty much all of the time since he broke through. I could see him dropping down to the championship. What makes you see him as PL player?

278~~~
I think he can be a good player. He needs a good premier league loan where he gets minutes... and he will get minutes if we can get him a decent club.. Not someone in the top half.. they would have defenders.. But a side that wants a defender.. 
I think he'll do well if he gets regular minutes... and then we'll know better if he can make the step up..

279~~~
He won't get regular minutes at any PL team on loan. No PL side wants a 21 year old with 1600 minutes of first team football under his belt other than to be a back up.

280~~~
I insist. This kid should go back to being a midfielder....

281~~~
His wiki page says he has scored 23 goals for us in 24 appearances. That is Messi/Ronaldo-esqe if you ask me. 
<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_McNair" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_McNair</a>

282~~~
Let's see what he can do as a midfielder. Obviously I will write him off from centre back as he's not good enough in there but play in midfield will be his second chance. Eric dier is an example.

283~~~
His instinct is more of a midfielder actually. Would do no harm to use him there since he plays there for Northern Ireland

284~~~
Well I guess Northern Ireland play in a different way than we're supposed to, nobody expects them to dominate games, and while he might be a good midfielders for a side like them (midtable type PL team), I can't see him be it for a top side like we want to be.

285~~~
Played pretty well last couple of internationals as a holding midfielder, looked more comfortable there than anything i've seen from him at centre back. Pretty good on the ball too.

286~~~
Can't be any worse than he is at the back.

287~~~
I have no idea where the new narrative that he is terrible has come from? It's like the caf needs a shiny new toy every 6 months, after that introductory phrase everyone jumps on players backs. Mcnair did well last season and was a pretty decent squad player, he's probably not United quality but its crazy how written off he's become so quickly. Looking forward for everyone jumping on Rashfords back at the start of next season.

288~~~
This

289~~~
I thought McNair was very impressive last season, especially against Chelsea away. I saw two future first team regulars in Shaw and McNair in that game. It's a shame how this season has gone for them.

McNair needs to lock down a position instead of being painted with the Jack of all trades brush due to his versatility. He started off as a midfielder, so I believe he could take to that role again if given an opportunity. He's good on the ball.

290~~~
I still think it's RB. If ivanovic can do it & Mcnair is a better dribbler - I still think that's the way to go. van gaal would have surely bought a younger RB than Damian otherwise.

291~~~
Erm, what? Darmian is 26. What are you on about? I honestly reckon that once LvG goes, McNair will be gone too.

292~~~
I think Mourinho will give most players a chance in his first season. His versatility might give him a chance at staying.

293~~~
Well considering Mcnair was similarly or marginally less impressive than rashford last season during a point of call - then I do worry for our youngsters.

294~~~
Behave. 

Rashford never had to get taken off before half time because he was beyond awful.

295~~~
Behave? You are basing Mcnair off one bad game. After that he hasn't showed up fair; but he has 3 even 4 times better games than he has bad.

296~~~
Rashford put in MOTM performances against Arsenal, and Midgetland. He also won us the manchester derby.

McNair has been dross. People on here thought Blackett and McNair were the future, Blackett is currently not getting a game for Celtic, and McNair will end up similarly.

297~~~
He's definitely a defensive midfielder. The amount of forward runs he makes as a defender makes Phil Jones look normal in comparison. Though i don't know about his passing skills. Haven't seen much of that. Wonder if Blackett could become a William Carvalho playing the DM. He's pretty athletic and can pass well.

298~~~
Nobody who had any clue about the youth thought that. Blackett was terrible for the U21's, and always looked to be an athlete who coasted by because he was bigger and stronger than the youngster he was up against and showed very limited concentration and defensive awareness. He never looked like making it at United, and was predicted a future in the lower leagues, let alone Premiership/making it at United (or even Celtic).

McNair is a weird one. He looked pretty good at U21's not anything special like a Wilson or Januzaj, but he was good. But I think when posters heard that a young defender was being called up most would have expected Tom Thorpe and were pleasantly surpised by it being McNair, but I don't think that many thought he'd be "the future".

I agree that he won't cut it either in the Prem either, he doesn't really have a position but would be a useful squad player to Championship teams.

299~~~

300~~~
He was good last season imo. Some of his performances at CB was very good for someone who hadnt played at the top level at all. He was MOTM in his first game too. If Mcnair played 20 games last season, aout 15 of them were good performances. So to call him dross is extremely harsh.

This season he has been poor and he is someone who genuinely hasnt got games. I think he started maybe 3 or 4 games. Hard to write him off over that.

301~~~
Agreed. The hyperbole on this board is getting a bit much, especially when describing young and inexperienced players. Terms like "dross", "absolutely awful", "horrendous" etc. I don't know why fans do not just state the obvious, he's struggling with his composure and ability to step up to the first team. He definitely looked more at home in front of the back four in an anchor role in the 21's. Unfortunately he won't get the same luxury in the first team with the importance of the position.

302~~~
Bullshit cliched nonsense.

303~~~
Far from it. Read back to when they were being played last season. Many thought Blackett was the better player, especially during the 352 phase.

It's calling a spade a spade for those who are saying its harsh to say he's awful. He just doesn't fit in at this level. Not everyone is going to be good enough from our academy and there's nothing wrong with that.

304~~~
Blackett was always called clumsy whoever watched him in U21 and most were not convinced about his talent. McNair was praised a bit more because he performed well last season and was one of our best players at Chelsea.

305~~~
It is not calling a spade a spade. It is using excessive hyperbole to describe young players performances. Donald Love has not even looked close to being ready and able to play for our first team let alone Wigans. That doesn't mean he has been "dross" and he has probably been the only player who has looked completely out of his depth while being called upon by Van Gaal. To describe McNair's performances as "dross" is just ludicrous.

Save the hyperbole for more established players and leave the young guys be and let them develop further.

306~~~
I definitely think McNair was one of the better youngsters that van Gaal has introduced into the first team. He looked a naturally good footballer and had the confidence to try and take responsibility on the ball. Yes he made mistakes, notably that game at Southampton, but I wouldn't give up on him and given how many square pegs in round holes we've had the past two seasons why not try him in midfield ?

Like someone else said Dier has become an international midfielder having been brought 18 months ago as a centre back. A player who can play in various positions I always think knows where's he's best and not necessarily where the coach says.

307~~~
I think we have better talents from the academy/U21s if we want to promote a midfielder, however I like his confidence on the ball last season for the first team and generally in the U21s.His passing is usually accurate as well when he's on his game.I definitely believe he can become a decent midfielder (by "decent" I mean a PL level player).

308~~~
If we have Pochettino as a manager then I can see McNair will be given a go in midfield as both Dier and McNair seem to have a similar playing style. But if Mourinho is the manager, I don't think he is going to take a risk to keep him. And it seems LVG doesn't rate him anymore. This Euro 2016 will be his best opportunity to show what he can do as a holding midfielder.

309~~~
Problem is - that's where I see mensah switching between cB and Cdm during game depending on what we need. Mcnair could do it too but he would be behind mensah and possibly blind next season.

310~~~
I absolutely love his dribbling and so I don't see him as a first team CB. 

Can you work and train on speed and acceleration?


CDM and RB.

311~~~
Glad to see there are other people who don't think he's all that bad. He showed genuine promise at times last season, the three games that come to mind being Everton, West Ham and Chelsea. I think his awful performance away at Bournemouth this season in a makeshift (at best) back four is far more fresh in the memory for most people than any of those games. Send him out on loan and see if he can find some consistency.

i also think it doesn't help him that he's a defender who came through at the same time as Blackett, who was genuinely quite shit, so he kind of gets lumped in with him - "the likes of Blackett and McNair".

312~~~
He is easily twice the player Blackett is. Needs to go on loan though for sure.

313~~~
What a season McNair has had in the first team. 400 mins of playing time. He's been dreadful for at least half those mins and no better than ok for the rest. Unused sub 24 times so far.

Last season he had just over 1200 mins of playing time in the first team.

314~~~
OK.

315~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36339187" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BBC name Paddy McNair Northern Ireland's man of the match in a 3-0 win over Belarus</a>

<b>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill:                                     </b>
"Paddy McNair was outstanding throughout, while Conor has scored two in three games to make a big statement. It was great to see Will (Grigg) get on the scoresheet too."

316~~~
Completely forgot about him.

317~~~
He impressed me a lot. Perhaps, if he played for Everton instead of Stones, he would be worth £50m <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

318~~~
Was first to comment on Jose too, has a good attitude.

“He’s a world class manager. He’s worked at massive clubs and worked with some of the best players in the world,” <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/football-news/paddy-mcnair-looking-to-shine-in-front-of-jose-mourinho-at-euro-2016-finals-1-7399575#ixzz49ePhzYLT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">McNair said</a>.

“Obviously, I’ll be looking to impress. If I’m playing (in France) hopefully he can watch me and make his opinion of me there. Pre-season will be another chance to impress.

“My aim is to train well and try and impress the new manager. Hopefully he can also give me tips to make me a better player.

“If he likes you as a player he likes you. If he doesn’t he doesn’t. I’ll try my hardest to impress. That will be my aim.”

319~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

320~~~
Good attitude, wouldn't mind seeing him given a chance in CDM

321~~~
He's a midfielder for sure.

322~~~
I just don't see him getting games for us next year. He's not good enough unfortunately.

323~~~
1) First of all he must go on loan next season.....to sell him could be a mistake.
2) That club must play him in midfield (I still think that is his best position and he will do what Dier has done this season).

324~~~
He was only seen as a good prospect because he offers something else from defence but that's just because he is not a defender but midfielder. Maybe as a DM he will make a good career but I don't think jose will rate him at all. He needs a lot work on him and there is no time for that however if he stars on loan there is a little chance for. A lot more talented footballers ahead of him though

325~~~
I still really like McNair but I have a hard time seeing where on the pitch he can make a name for himself at United in the long run.  

We're going to pick up a solid CB this summer, Stones I suppose.  And if Jones can stay healthy for six months (I know, I know) he's several notches above McNair no question.  Ok, what about RB?  Darmian, Varela and Valencia say boo to that.  LB?  Shaw and Bo-Jack object.  What about defensive midfield?  Timothy Fosu-Mensah giggles.  Paddy is no attacking midfielder, no trequartista, no winger and no striker.

If the man has to be sent off, or at least loaned for a season never to be seen again at OT, I'll always remember that run of 5 or 6 incredible performances Paddy put in for us.  I can't recall the opponent, but that crazy back header on the cross saved us from a certain goal that could have sent us in a serious tail spin last season.

326~~~
He's he playing solely as a DM now for Ireland?

327~~~
I don't rate him at all. Haven't seen any of his games for Northern Ireland though, so is he a CDM now? That could potentially save his United career if so.

Still think he should be loaned out next season. Hopefully to a Premier League team like West Brom or Watford or something like that. He needs game time. I always rated Blackett over him though. McNair to me seems like your typical average "British" player but Blackett for me, looks like he could be something special.

328~~~
Blackett?

Really?

329~~~
CDMs usually mature quite late, so I can still see him forging a good solid career. I just don't think he's going get his opportunity with United under Mourinho. At the same age, Schneiderlin was playing in the championship with Southampton and we've also seen how Danny Drinkwater's career turned around since leaving United. So a loan spell or two won't hurt him.

330~~~
Blackett <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Not going to take that post seriously. There is not a single thing the guy does better than McNair.

331~~~
McNair is/will become a decent player but if we need a youth CDM we should have just kept Ben Pearson.

332~~~
Jose is pretty good with DM's, maybe he'll find a way to utilize him.  He's versatile enough to play across the back four as well i think.

333~~~
So is he going to the Euros?

334~~~
Yes, MotM performance yesterday.

335~~~
Please. His Passing, physicality and strength are all significantly better than McNair. This loan move to Celtic has been a disaster, so it's harsh to judge him on that. If he was at United this season, I fancy him to make more of an impression with all the youth coming through this season. He has all the attributes to be a top CB for us in my opinion. But it all depends on who Jose signs. Obviously Varane would be years ahead of him. But if he focused purely on the youth, then I'd put Blackett near the top of the list, alongside Wilson.

336~~~
No, his passing is nowhere close. He might be slightly stronger but for being such a big fecker he is incredibly soft and has no idea how to use his size. This loan has been a disaster, he was a disaster in our first team, he was a disaster when he dropped back down to the u21s and he was a disaster on all of his previous loans. There is a reason he was shipped out this season, van Gaal finally realized how bloody awful he is. 

Blackett something special, top of the list of our youth. Loublaze will be pleased to find he is no longer the only member of the club that rates Blackett. He is no where near good enough, never has and never will.

337~~~
No chance.

338~~~
Is this a joke? He could be a decent CB for a team like WBA and all who needs full backs who defend but would be extremely lucky to get a chance here. Even Wilson will find himself lucky to get a chance next season at United.

339~~~
Northern Irish guy I speak to said he was amazing playing CDM the other day, which I guess given the fact that he was always reasonably comfortable on the ball shouldn't be too much of a surprise.

340~~~
I like McNair. Although want him gone on loan to a championship team where he can be a regular. Still feel he can be a decent squad player for us

341~~~
Yeah, i really like him playing for NI in a midfield role whereas i havn't been a fan of him at all in defence for Utd. He'll be very close to a starter in the Euro's, has done very well in the last few games. The tournament should be a good experience for him.

342~~~
Yep he always looked like he had a mistake in him as well as having a few stinkers, hopefully this role will suit his attributes a bit better as he does look like a decent player at times.

343~~~
Has been a breath of Fresh air for us NI fans. He was superb against Greece making those bombing runs down the right flank from right back and has been just as comfortable in the Defensive midfield slot. It's a relief to see players like this coming through off the back of Baird and Hughes' probable swansong in France.

344~~~
Right...

345~~~
I'm probably his biggest critic when he's played for us, especially at CB.

Hope he proves me wrong about him and has a great game today against Poland. All the best Paddy.

346~~~
He was very good for us in his first season, especially considering that it's his first senior season ever.

I think he could be a good squad defender like Evans used to be.

347~~~
didnt watch the game but noticed he was subbed at half time - injured or crap?

348~~~
Neither (as far as I know not injured anyway). Just sacrificed so NI could add more offensively.

349~~~
fair enough - was interested to know how he does in this midfield role on the international stage

350~~~
So far so good,  he's done well in the #6 role. This Euros will be a step up!
